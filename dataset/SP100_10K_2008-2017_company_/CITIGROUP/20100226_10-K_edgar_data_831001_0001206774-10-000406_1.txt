OVERVIEW  

Citigroup   s history
dates back to the founding of Citibank in 1812. Citigroup s original corporate
predecessor was incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Following a series of transactions over a number of years, Citigroup Inc. was
formed in 1998 upon the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group
Inc.        Citigroup is now a global diversified financial services holding company
whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions
with a broad range of financial products and services. Citi has approximately
200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 140
countries.        Citigroup currently operates, for management
reporting purposes, via two primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of
our    Regional Consumer Banking    businesses and    Institutional Clients Group   ; and Citi Holdings, consisting of our    Brokerage and Asset Management    and    Local Consumer Lending    businesses, and a    Special Asset Pool   . There is also a third segment, 
   Corporate/Other    .  For a further description of
the business segments and the products and services they provide, see  Citigroup

OVERVIEW (Continued)  

On December 23, 2009,
Citigroup repaid $20 billion of trust preferred securities held by the U.S.
Treasury under the U.S. government s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
and exited from the loss-sharing agreement, which covered a specified
pool of assets, with the U.S. Treasury, FDIC and the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. In connection with the exiting from the loss-sharing agreement,
$1.8 billion of the approximately $7.1 billion of additional trust preferred
securities held by the U.S. Treasury and FDIC was cancelled. As a result of the
repayment of TARP and the exit from the loss-sharing agreement,
effective in 2010, Citi is no longer deemed to be a beneficiary of  exceptional
financial assistance  under TARP.  

              Following these
transactions, as of December 31, 2009 (i) the U.S. Treasury continued to hold
approximately 7.7 billion shares, or approximately 27%, of Citi s common stock,
(ii) the U.S. Treasury and FDIC continue to hold an aggregate of approximately
$5.3 billion of Citi s trust preferred securities, and (iii) the U.S. Treasury
continues to hold three warrants exercisable for an aggregate of approximately
465.1 million shares of Citi s common stock. See  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

Introduction  

        Citigroup is a global
diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide
consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of
financial products and services, including consumer banking, credit cards,
corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage and wealth management.
Citigroup has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in
more than 140 countries.  

              In response to the
dramatic and profound changes in the market environment that became increasingly
apparent through 2008, in early 2009, Citigroup decided to increase the focus on
its core businesses and reorganized into three business segments for management
and reporting purposes: Citicorp (   Regional Consumer Banking  and 
Institutional Clients Group   ); Citi Holdings (   Brokerage    and    Asset Management, Local Consumer Lending,  and  Special Asset Pool   ); and Corporate/Other (Treasury, corporate
expenses). Citi believes the realignment allows it to enhance the capabilities
and performance of Citigroup s core assets, through Citicorp, as well as to
tighten its focus on risk management and reduce and realize value from its
non-core assets, through Citi Holdings.  

              Citigroup reported a
net loss for 2009 of $1.6 billion, as compared to a $27.7 billion loss in 2008.
Diluted EPS was a loss of $0.80 per share in 2009, versus a loss of $5.63 per
share in 2008, and net revenue was $80.3 billion in 2009, versus $51.6 billion
in 2008. Net interest revenue declined by $4.8 billion to $48.9 billion in 2009,
generally as a result of lower average interest-earning assets, as the company
continued its focus on de-risking its balance sheet and decreasing its total
assets. Non-interest revenues improved by approximately $33.5 billion to $31.4
billion in 2009, primarily due to lower negative revenue marks in 2009. The
decrease in net loss from year to year was primarily attributable to lower
revenue marks in 2009 compared with 2008 (a pretax loss of $3.4 billion in 2009
versus a pretax loss of $38.5 billion in 2008), the $11.1 billion pretax Smith
Barney gain on sale recorded in the second quarter of 2009 and a $1.4 billion
pretax gain related to the exchange offers recognized in the third quarter of
2009. Partially offsetting these items were increasing credit loss provisions
during the year and a $10.1 billion pretax loss associated with the repayment of
TARP and the exit from the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government.
Additionally, 2008 included a $9.6 billion pretax goodwill impairment, a $0.9
billion pretax impairment related to Nikko Asset Management, and $3.3 billion
pretax of restructuring/repositioning charges. Continued strength of the core
Citi franchise was demonstrated by 

strong revenues in
   Securities and Banking     (S B)    (up 23% from 2008 levels, excluding credit
value adjustments (CVA)) and continued stability in both the retail and
institutional deposit bases. At December 31, 2009, total deposits were $836
billion, up 8% from December 31, 2008.  

              Despite very
difficult market and economic conditions, Citicorp remained profitable with
$14.8 billion in income from continuing operations in 2009 versus $6.2 billion
in 2008, reflecting the strength of the underlying franchise, continued client
focus, cost management and strengthened risk management. Citi Holdings recorded
a loss of $8.2 billion in 2009 versus a $36.0 billion loss in 2008 as
substantial reductions in negative revenue marks, cost cuts and the Smith Barney
gain more than offset continued increases in credit costs within    Local Consumer Lending   . The gain related to the exchange offers and loss associated with TARP
repayment and exiting the loss-sharing agreement was recorded in    Corporate/Other   .

Citigroup s 2009
financial results include the impact of 18 divestitures completed in 2009,
including Smith Barney, Nikko Cordial Securities and Nikko Asset Management, and
19 divestitures completed in 2008, including Citi s German retail banking
operations, CitiCapital and Redecard. These divestitures were completed in
accordance with Citi s strategy of exiting non-core businesses, while optimizing
value for shareholders. 

              Citi s effective tax
rate on continuing operations in 2009 was 86%, versus 39% in 2008. The tax
provision reflected a benefit arising from a higher proportion of income earned
and indefinitely reinvested in countries with relatively lower tax rates, which
accounted for 26 percentage points of the differential between the
federal statutory tax rate and Citi s effective tax rate in 2009, as well as a
higher proportion of income from tax-advantaged sources. 

Repayment of TARP and Exit
from Loss-Sharing Agreement; Common and Preferred Stock Activities

Background  

        In October and December
2008, Citigroup raised $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively, through the
sale of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to the U.S.
Treasury as part of TARP. In January 2009, Citi issued approximately $7.1
billion of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury and FDIC, as well as a warrant
to purchase common stock to the U.S. Treasury, as consideration for the
loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. Treasury, FDIC and the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York covering a specified pool of Citigroup assets.  

              Pursuant to
Citigroup s exchange offers consummated in July 2009, the $25 billion of TARP
preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in October 2008 was exchanged for
approximately 7.7 billion shares of Citigroup common stock. At the same time,
the $20 billion of TARP preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in December
2008 and the approximately $7.1 billion of   

7  

preferred stock issued
to the U.S. Treasury and FDIC as consideration for the loss-sharing agreement
were exchanged for trust preferred securities. Prior to the exchange of the
preferred stock held by the U.S. government pursuant to the exchange offers,
Citigroup paid the U.S. government approximately $2.2 billion in preferred
dividends on its investment in Citi, and has subsequently paid approximately
$800 million in interest on the trust preferred securities issued pursuant
to the exchange offers. 

Repayment of TARP and Exit
from loss-sharing agreement  

        On December 23, 2009,
Citigroup repaid the $20 billion of TARP trust preferred securities held by the
U.S. Treasury and exited the loss-sharing agreement. In connection with the exit
of the loss-sharing agreement, $1.8 billion of the trust preferred securities
held by the U.S. Treasury out of the approximately $7.1 billion of trust
preferred securities issued in consideration for such agreement to the U.S.
Treasury and FDIC was cancelled.  

              In  connection
with the repayment of TARP in December 2009, Citigroup raised an aggregate of
approximately $20.3 billion in common equity.  On December 22, 2009
Citigroup issued $17.0 billion of common stock, or approximately 5.4 billion
shares, and $3.5 billion of tangible equity units (T-DECs) of which
approximately $2.8 billion was recorded as common equity and $0.7 billion was
recorded as long-term debt. On December 29, 2009, Citigroup raised an additional
approximate $0.6 billion of common stock, or approximately 185 million shares,
pursuant to exercise of the underwriters  overallotment option. In addition, in
January 2010, Citigroup issued $1.7 billion of common stock equivalents to its
employees in lieu of cash compensation they would have otherwise received.
Subject to shareholder approval at Citi s annual shareholder meeting scheduled
to be held on April 20, 2010, the common stock equivalents will be converted
into common stock.  

              Following the
repayment of TARP and exit from the loss-sharing agreement, as of
December 31, 2009, the U.S. Treasury continues to hold approximately 7.7 billion
shares, or approximately 27.0%, of Citi s common stock, not including the
exercise of the warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury that remain outstanding, as
described below. The U.S. Treasury has indicated that it intends to sell its
holding in Citi common stock in 2010, subject to a 90-day lock-up period
expiring on March 16, 2010. In addition, the U.S. Treasury and FDIC continue to
hold an aggregate of approximately $5.3 billion of the trust preferred
securities originally issued by Citi as consideration for the loss-sharing
agreement. 

              As a result of Citi s
repayment of the $20 billion of TARP trust preferred securities and the exit of
the loss-sharing agreement, effective in 2010, Citi is no longer deemed to be a
beneficiary of  exceptional financial assistance  under TARP.

Common stock warrants issued to the U.S.
Treasury  

        The three warrants
issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of TARP and the loss-sharing agreement
remain outstanding as of December 31, 2009 following Citi s repayment of TARP
and exit from the loss-sharing agreement.  

              Each of the warrants
has a term of 10 years from the date of issuance. The warrant issued to the U.S.
Treasury in October 2008 has an exercise price of $17.85 per share and is
exercisable for approximately 210.1 million shares of common stock. The warrant
issued to the U.S. Treasury in December 2008 has an exercise price of $10.61 per
share and is exercisable for approximately 188.5 million shares of common stock.
The warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the loss-sharing agreement in
January 2009 also has an exercise price of $10.61 and is exercisable for
approximately 66.5 million shares of common stock.

              In addition to the U.S. government exchanges, pursuant to the
      exchange offers, private holders of approximately $12.5 billion aggregate
      liquidation value of Citi preferred stock exchanged such preferred stock
      for approximately 3.8 billion shares of Citi common stock. In addition,
      public holders of approximately $20.3 billion aggregate liquidation value
      of Citi preferred stock and trust preferred securities exchanged such
      securities for approximately 5.8 billion shares of Citi common
      stock.

Business Environment  

        The business environment
for financial services firms continued to be challenging in 2009, particularly
for firms with significant exposure to consumer credit. U.S. unemployment
reached 10.1%, GDP continued to contract through the second quarter, housing
markets remained weak, and personal and business bankruptcies increased. These
factors drove substantial increases in credit costs across consumer and
corporate portfolios. Credit spreads continued to widen earlier in the year,
driving further declines in the value of credit-sensitive financial instruments.
Equity markets were also very weak during early 2009. At its low point in March
2009, the S P 500 had declined 55% from December 31, 2007 levels.

While these trends
were negative for the economy and the financial services industry as a whole,
they were accompanied by very high levels of volatility and wide spreads within
fixed income markets during the first quarter of 2009, which provided
substantial trading opportunities. As a result, fixed income capital markets
businesses achieved high levels of revenue and profitability during the first
quarter, offsetting some of the substantial credit losses incurred in
consumer-oriented businesses, including mortgages and cards. 

              Beginning in late
2008, significant U.S. government actions were implemented to help stabilize the
U.S. economy and restore confidence in the capital markets. The U.S. government
had available over $700 billion to invest in financial institutions, including
$45 billion in Citi, through TARP. In early 2009, a $787 billion stimulus bill
was signed into law. A number of additional programs helped further stimulate
demand in 2009, including the U.S. government s first-time home buyer credit
programs. The U.S. government also directly supported the capital markets
through various programs, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan
Facility (TALF) and the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), and
through substantial direct purchases of mortgage-backed securities. These
actions, combined with continued accommodative monetary policy on the part of
the Federal Reserve Board, helped keep home mortgage rates near historic lows
and worked to facilitate the continued flow of credit to consumers. 

              Late in 2009, some
early positive economic signs were observed. U.S. GDP growth was positive in the
third and fourth quarters. The S P 500 finished the year up 23% from
December 31, 2008, and up 67% from the trough level in March 2009, though still
down 24% from December 31, 2007. Credit spreads, while still elevated, tightened
significantly from peak levels in the early part of 2009. In the second half of
the year, Citi began to observe some very early signs of stabilization and, in
some areas, moderation in U.S. consumer credit trends as net credit losses
declined sequentially during the third and fourth quarters, though remaining
quite elevated. In addition,  

improving economic and
market trends led to relatively stronger advisory and equity underwriting
volumes in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, lower levels of market
volatility and volumes resulted in diminished trading opportunities, which led
to significant sequential declines in  S B  revenues in the second half of the
year. In certain key markets in    Asia    and
   Latin America   , improvement in the labor markets and overall
economic recovery was earlier, and somewhat stronger, than that observed in the
U.S. Citi observed improving credit trends in key markets including South Korea,
Mexico, Australia, Singapore and India, driven by improving economic conditions
as well as Citi s loss mitigation efforts. Further, while    EMEA    continued to
be affected by a challenging economic environment, labor markets began to show
some improvement, particularly in Russia and Turkey, and there were some early
signs of financial stability returning to some of Citi s key markets in the
region. 

              While some economic
and market improvements were observed in late 2009, Citi remains cautious,
particularly with respect to its North American businesses, as U.S. unemployment
remains high at 10.0% as of December 31, 2009, and housing markets remain
relatively weak. In addition, there remains significant uncertainty regarding
the pace of economic recovery and the impact of the U.S. government s unwinding
of its extensive economic and market supports, which may accelerate in 2010. See
 2010 Business Outlook  below. 

Citigroup's Actions in Response to Market
Challenges  

During 2009, Citigroup
sought to respond to market challenges and the profound changes in the market
environment changes in funding markets, operating models and client
needs including:  

Citi restructured into two primary operating segments Citicorp and Citi
Holdings.   

        As described above,
Citicorp comprises Citi s core franchise, while Citi Holdings consists of
non-core businesses and assets that Citi intends to exit as quickly
as practicable while seeking to optimize value
for shareholders.  

Citigroup continued to reduce operating expenses and
headcount.   

        Citi s ongoing operating
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $12.3 billion, down from $15.1
billion (excluding the goodwill impairment charge) in the fourth quarter of 2008
and $15.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. The decline in expenses was
primarily driven by divestitures and re-engineering efforts. In addition, Citi
reduced headcount by over 100,000 to approximately 265,000 at December 31, 2009,
compared to 375,000 at peak levels in 2007.  

10  

Citigroup strengthened its balance sheet.   

Citi increased its common capital
  ratios.    Citi
  significantly increased its Tier 1 Common and Tangible Common   Equity (TCE) ratios during 2009, primarily
  as a result of its exchange   offers completed in the third quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2009,
  Citi s   Tier 1 Common ratio was
  9.6% and its TCE ratio was 10.9%, compared   to 2.3% and 3.1% at December 31, 2008,
  respectively. In addition,   Citi s Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.7% at December 31, 2009. Tier 
   1 Common and related ratios are
  measures used and relied on by U.S.   banking regulators; however, Tier 1 Common, TCE and related ratios
  are   non-GAAP financial measures
  for SEC purposes. See  Capital Resources   and Liquidity Capital Resources  for
  additional information on   these
  measures.   
           
           Citi improved its liquidity
  position.    Citigroup
  lengthened the maturity structure of its liabilities, increased   balances of cash and highly liquid
  securities, continued to grow its   deposit base, raised substantial equity capital and reduced illiquid
  assets,   primarily in Citi
  Holdings. As a result, structural liquidity (defined as   deposits, long-term debt and equity as a
  percentage of total assets) grew   to 73% as of December 31, 2009, compared to 66% at December 31,
  2008   and 63% at December 31,
  2007. Citigroup had $193 billion of cash and   deposits with banks as of December 31, 2009.
  Citi currently anticipates   issuing less than $15 billion of Citigroup-level long-term debt in 2010
  (down from   $85 billion in 2009)
  due to its current strong liquidity position and   anticipated asset reductions within Citi
  Holdings.   
           
           Citi continued to de-risk and decrease the
  amount of its total assets.    Citi s total assets were approximately $1.86 trillion as of December
  31,   2009, down from
  approximately $1.94 trillion at December 31, 2008 and   $2.19 trillion at December 31, 2007.
  Consistent with Citi s strategy, Citi   Holdings now represents less than 30% of Citi s total assets as of
  December   31, 2009, compared to
  41% at the start of 2008. While Citi made progress   in de-risking and decreasing total assets,
  particularly in Citi Holdings,   these actions, together with an expansion of the Company s loss
  mitigation   efforts and
  declining yields in the trading book, resulted in a 9% reduction   in net interest revenue in 2009 versus 2008
  and a decrease in   Citi s net
  interest margin (NIM) to 2.65% at December 31, 2009   compared to 3.26% at December 31,
  2008.   

Citigroup increased its allowance for loan losses.

During 2009, Citi added
a net build of $8.0 billion to its allowance for loan losses. The allowance for
loan losses was $36 billion at December 31, 2009, or 6.1% of loans, compared to
$29.6 billion, or 4.3% of loans, at year-end 2008. With the adoption of SFAS 166
and 167 in the first quarter of 2010, loan loss reserves would have been $49.4
billion, or 6.6% of loans, each as of December 31, 2009 and based on current
estimates. The consumer loan loss reserve was $28.4 billion at December 31,
2009, representing 14.1 months of concurrent charge-off coverage, versus 13.1
months at December 31, 2008. 

Citi began to make selected investments in its core businesses.

Within    Regional Consumer Banking   , Citi began making selected investments in its core businesses in the
latter part of 2009. For example, in    Asia   , Citi invested
in new customer acquisition in the emerging affluent segment and in card usage
promotion. In    Latin America   , Citi invested in card account acquisition,
with a focus on higher-quality new accounts, consistent with portfolio
repositioning objectives. Citigroup also continued to invest in consumer banking
technology, for example, in banking products in markets such as Singapore, Hong
Kong and South Korea, where mobile phones and mobile banking have intersected in
ways not yet seen in the U.S. Within    Transaction Services   , Citi continued to invest in technology to support its global network,
including its investor services suite of products, prepaid and commercial cards
offerings and launch of a new front end online banking technology that provides
a diverse set of functionality beyond traditional transaction management and
reporting.   These and similar
investments have increased, and will likely continue to increase, Citi s
operating expenses. 

2010 BUSINESS OUTLOOK  

        While showing signs of
improvement, the macroeconomic environment going into 2010 remains challenging,
with U.S. unemployment still elevated. The U.S. government has indicated its
intention to continue scaling back programs put in place to support the market
during 2008 and 2009. The impact of the U.S. government s exit from many of
these programs is a source of uncertainty in 2010, as is the future course of
monetary policy. In addition, the potential impact of new laws and regulations
(e.g., The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009
(CARD Act)), potential new capital standards, and other legislative and
regulatory initiatives is a source of significant additional uncertainty
regarding the business and market environment.  

11  

Citigroup is
maintaining a cautious stance in light of this uncertain market environment and
continued macroeconomic headwinds. As it enters 2010, Citi is focused on
maintaining high levels of capital and liquidity, rigorous risk management
practices and cost discipline. In Citi Holdings, Citi will continue to focus on
reducing assets, which could result in lower revenues and operating expenses in
2010. In Citicorp, the focus will remain on serving the company s core
institutional, corporate and retail client base in the U.S. and around the
world. Citi will continue to focus on credit loss mitigation and expense
control, and may continue to invest in areas such as    Asia    and
   Latin America   , where economic recovery and growth appear to
be taking hold. Operating expenses may grow modestly in Citicorp in 2010, as a
portion of the cost reductions achieved in Citi Holdings is re-invested in the
core franchise.  

              Credit costs will
likely remain a significant driver of Citigroup s results in 2010, particularly
in    North America   , where credit trends will largely depend on
the broader macroeconomic environment, as well as the impact 

of industry factors such
as CARD Act implementation and the outcome of the Home Affordable Modification
Program (HAMP) and other loss mitigation efforts. See  Results of
Operations Citicorp  North America Regional
Consumer Banking ,      Citi
Holdings  Local Consumer Lending  
and     Managing Global
Risk Credit Risk  for additional information. Citi expects U.S. consumer net
credit losses to increase modestly in the first quarter of 2010 from fourth
quarter 2009 levels, due in part to expected seasonal patterns, after which
there may be some slight improvement. However, net credit losses in the second
half of 2010 will be dependent on the macroeconomic environment and success of
the company s ongoing loss mitigation efforts. Changes to Citigroup s consumer
loan loss reserve balances will continue to reflect the losses embedded in
Citi s consumer loan portfolio due to underlying credit trends as well as the
impact of Citi s forbearance programs. Citi currently expects NIM to remain
under pressure due to its enhanced liquidity position and ongoing de-risking of
the balance sheet.

2009 vs. 2008  

         Revenues, net of interest
expense    declined 7%,
primarily reflecting higher credit losses in the securitization trusts, which
were offset by higher credit-card-securitization revenue, higher net interest
margin in cards and higher volumes in retail banking. 

               Net interest
revenue    was up 24%, driven
by the impact of pricing actions and lower funding costs in Citi-branded cards,
and by higher deposit volumes in retail banking, with average deposits up 11%
from the prior year. 

               Non-interest
revenue    declined 34%,
driven by higher credit losses flowing through the securitization trusts
partially offset by securitization revenue, and by the absence of a $349 million
gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $170 million gain from a cards portfolio
sale in the prior year. 

Operating
expenses    declined 36% from
the prior year. Excluding a 2008 goodwill impairment charge of $2.3 billion,
expenses were down 12% reflecting the benefits from re-engineering efforts,
lower marketing costs, and the absence of $217 million in repositioning charges
in the prior year offset by the absence of a prior-year $159 million Visa
litigation reserve release. 

               Provisions for loan
losses and for benefits and claims    increased $562 million, or 52%, primarily due
to rising net credit losses in both cards and retail banking. Continued
weakening of leading credit indicators and trends in the macroeconomic
environment, including rising unemployment and higher bankruptcy filings,
primarily drove higher credit costs. The cards managed net credit loss ratio
increased 386 basis points to 9.58%, while the retail banking net credit loss
ratio increased 75 basis points to 4.29% (see the  Managed Presentations 
section below). 

18  

2008 vs. 2007  

          Revenues, net of
interest expense      decreased 21%, driven by
lower securitization revenue and higher credit losses in the securitization
trusts, which were partially offset by higher net interest margin in cards and
higher revenues in retail banking. Lower securitization revenue was mainly
driven by a write-down of $1.1 billion in the residual interest in securitized
balances. The residual interest was primarily affected by deterioration in the
projected credit loss assumption used to value the asset.  

                Net
interest revenue    was up 21%, mainly driven by lower funding costs.  

                Non-interest
revenue   
decreased 39%, primarily due to lower securitization revenue, higher credit
losses in the securitization trusts, and the absence of a $297 million gain on
the sale of MasterCard shares in 2007. This decline was partially offset by a
$349 million gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $170 million gain from a
cards portfolio sale in 2008.  

                Operating
expenses increased    31%, primarily driven by a
$2.3 billion goodwill impairment charge in 2008. Excluding the charge, expenses
were down 5% mainly reflecting the absence of a $292 million Visa
litigation-related charge in 2007 and a $159 million Visa litigation reserve
release in 2008, partially offset by $217 million repositioning charges in
2008.  

                Provisions
for loan losses and for benefits and claims    increased $540 million driven
by higher net credit losses, up $165 million, and a higher loan loss reserve
build, up $367 million, in both cards and retail banking. Higher credit costs
reflected a weakening of leading credit indicators, including the continued
acceleration in the rate at which delinquent cards customers advanced to
write-off, as well as trends in the macroeconomic environment, including the
housing market downturn and rising unemployment. The cards managed net credit
loss ratio increased 191 basis points to 5.72%, while the retail banking net
credit loss ratio increased 14 basis points to 3.54%.  

Managed Presentations  

         Managed-basis (Managed) presentations detail certain
non-GAAP financial measures. Managed presentations (applicable only to North
American branded and retail partner credit card operations in      NA RCB    and Citi Holdings      Local Consumer
Lending   ,
respectively, as there are no deconsolidated credit card securitizations in any
other region) include results from both the on-balance-sheet loans and
off-balance-sheet loans, and exclude the impact of credit card securitizations
activity. Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold
and present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as
Citigroup s owned loans. Citigroup believes that Managed presentations are
useful to investors because they are widely used by analysts and investors
within the credit card industry. Managed presentations are commonly used by
other companies within the financial services industry. See also the  2010
Outlook  for    NA     RCB    below.  

2010 Outlook  

         In 2010,      NA RCB    is expected to continue to
operate in a challenging economic and credit environment. Revenues will be
affected by the continued U.S. economic downturn that has impacted customer
demand and credit performance, as well as by legislative and regulatory changes.
Both retail banking and cards will continue to focus on tight expense control,
productivity improvements, and effective credit management. With high levels of
unemployment and bankruptcy filings in 2010, net credit losses, delinquencies
and defaults are expected to remain at elevated levels during the
year.  

                NA
RCB    results will also continue to be impacted by Citi s continued
implementation of the CARD Act as well as the company s loss mitigation and
forbearance programs, particularly in Citi s card and U.S. mortgage businesses.
The majority of the provisions of the CARD Act will have taken effect by
February 2010. The CARD Act implementation began to impact card revenues in the
fourth quarter of 2009 as lower net interest rate revenue due to such
implementation was partially mitigated by pricing actions. Management
within    NA RCB    continues to review and
revise the company s credit card business model to implement the required
changes of the CARD Act, and this will likely continue throughout 2010. While
management of  NA RCB    believes that it can mitigate
a portion of the impact of the CARD Act, Citi currently estimates that the net
impact of the CARD Act on  NA RCB
   revenues
for 2010 could be a reduction of approximately $400 to $600 million. See also
 Results of Operations Citi Holdings  Local
Consumer Lending   and  Managing Global Risk Credit Risk 
below.  

               In
addition, on January 1, 2010, Citi adopted SFAS No. 166,    Accounting for Transfers of
Financial Assets, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140    (SFAS 166) and SFAS No.
167    Amendments to FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R)    (SFAS 167). These new
accounting standards will be applied prospectively and will require
consolidation of certain credit card securitization trusts and
the elimination of sale accounting for transfers of credit card receivables
to those trusts. Under previous accounting standards, transfers of credit card
receivables to the securitization trusts were accounted for as sales.
Consequently, beginning in 2010, the financial results of    NA RCB    will vary from previously
reported financial results prepared under the amended accounting standards. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of  Future
Application of Accounting Standards  for further

2009 vs.
2008     Revenues, net of interest
expense     declined
17%. More than half of the revenue decline is attributable to the impact of FX
translation. Other drivers included lower wealth-management and lending revenues
due to lower volumes and spread compression from credit tightening initiatives.
Investment sales declined by 26% due to market conditions at the start of the
year with assets under management increasing by 9% by year
end.         Net interest revenue    was 23% lower than the prior year due to external competitive pressure
on rates and higher funding costs, with average loans for retail banking down
18% and average deposits down 18%. 

            Non-interest revenue    decreased by 3%, primarily due to the impact of FX translation.
Excluding FX there was marginal
growth.         Operating expenses   
declined 27%, reflecting expense control actions, lower marketing expenses and
the impact of FX translation. Cost savings were achieved by branch closures,
headcount reductions and process re-engineering
efforts.          Provisions for loan losses    increased $482 million to $794 million.  Net   credit
losses  increased from $237 million to $487 million, while the loan loss
reserve build increased from $75 million to $307 million. Higher credit costs
reflected continued credit deterioration across the region. 
 
          20  

2008 vs.
2007     Revenues, net of interest     expense increased 18% due to growth in the
size of the portfolio across Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
Investment sales declined by 39% with assets under management declining by 42%
as a result of market conditions in the second half of
2008.          Net interest revenue    was 31% higher than the prior year due to growth in the size of the
portfolio across Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and growth in
revolving balances. Average loans for retail banking were up 26%, cards were up
49% and average deposits were up
22%.          Non-interest revenue    decreased by 4% due to reduced investment revenue as a result of market
conditions.         Operating expenses   
increased 19%, reflecting growth in the portfolio and repositioning
charges.          Provisions for loan losses    increased 49% to $312 million.  Net
credit losses  increased from $113 million to $237 million, while the
 Loan loss reserve build  decreased by 22%
to $75 million. Credit costs increased as a result of market conditions driving
deterioration in the portfolio. 

2010
Outlook     During
2010,    EMEA RCB    businesses are expected to operate in an
environment of continued challenging economic and credit conditions. While key
business drivers, including deposits, investment sales and card purchase sales,
began to show some signs of improvement during the latter part of 2009,
continued positive developments, if any, will depend on the success of
   EMEA RCB    s strategy of concentrated focus on larger
urban markets. Credit quality is currently anticipated to improve modestly with
remedial programs and tighter origination standards reducing both delinquencies
and credit losses, with some continued pockets of weakness in Poland and
Hungary. Loan and card volume growth will continue to be controlled, driven by
tighter origination standards.

2009 vs.
2008    Revenues, net of interest
expense   declined 16%, driven by
the impact of FX translation as well as lower activity in the branded cards
business.            Net interest revenue    decreased 17%, mainly driven by FX translation impact as well as lower
volumes and spread compression in the branded cards business that offset the
growth in loans, deposits and investment products in the retail
business.            Non interest revenue    decreased 13%, driven also by FX impact and lower branded cards fee
income from lower customer activity.  

              Operating expenses   
decreased 52%, primarily driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment charge
of $4.3 billion in 2008, the benefit associated with the FX impact and saves
from restructuring actions implemented primarily at the end of 2008. The $125
million related to 2008 restructuring charges was offset by an expense benefit
of $257 million related to a legal vehicle restructuring in 2008. Expenses
increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to selected
marketing and investment
spending.          Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims    decreased 13% primarily reflecting lower loan
loss reserve builds as a result of lower volumes, improved portfolio quality and
lower net credit losses in the branded cards portfolio primarily in Mexico due
to repositioning in the portfolio. 

22  

2008 vs.
2007   

         Revenues,
net of interest expense   
increased 6% compared to the prior year, associated with higher volumes and
partially offset by the extraordinary gains recorded in 2007: a $235 million
gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $78 million gain on the sale of MasterCard
shares.          Net interest revenue    increased 15% driven by higher volumes in both the branded cards and
retail businesses.          Non-interest revenue    declined, driven by the 2007 Visa and MasterCard extraordinary
gains.         Operating expenses   
growth of 97% was mainly driven by goodwill impairment of $4.3 billion in 2008,
and to a lesser extent, restructuring charges of $125 million. Partially
offsetting these increases was a $257 million expense benefit related to a legal
vehicle restructuring.         Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims
   increased 94%, primarily
driven by higher loan loss reserve builds in 2008 reflecting portfolio growth
and market conditions. 

2010
Outlook      Improving economic conditions across the region, including the level of
exchange rates, the credit environment and unemployment rates, are currently
expected to have a positive impact on    LATAM RCB   
performance in 2010. However,    LATAM RCB    results
will depend on overall macroeconomic conditions in the region as well as the
impact of loss mitigation efforts and the repositioning of the
portfolio.         During the fourth quarter of 2009,
   LATAM RCB    began to increase investments in card account
acquisition, with a focus on higher-quality accounts. This step may begin to
contribute to account and card revenue growth in 2010. While the business
anticipates continued selective marketing and investment spending during the
year, management of    LATAM RCB    currently
expects that overall operating expenses will continue to reflect re-engineering
efforts.          In addition, Mexico s Ministry of Finance has publicly stated that the
U.S. government ownership stake in Citigroup does not violate Mexican law
barring indirect foreign government ownership of Mexican affiliate banks. The
Mexican Senate has asked the Mexican Supreme Court to determine the
constitutionality of the Ministry s interpretation. The Mexican Supreme Court is
considering and will issue a resolution on the matter. Neither Citi, Banamex nor
the U.S. government is a party to this proceeding.

2009 vs.
2008   

         Revenues,
net of interest expense   declined
9%, driven by the absence of the gain on Visa shares in the prior year, lower
investment product revenues and cards purchase sales, lower spreads, and the
impact of FX translation.            Net interest revenue    was 5% lower than the prior year. Average loans and deposits were down
10% and 4%, respectively, in each case partly due to the impact of FX
translation.            Non-interest revenue    declined 19%, primarily due to the decline in investment revenues, lower
cards purchase sales, the absence of the gain on Visa shares and the impact of
FX translation.  

Operating expenses   
declined 9%, reflecting the benefits of re-engineering efforts and the impact of
FX translation. Expenses increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2009
primarily due to selected marketing and investment
spending.          Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims    increased 28%, mainly due to the impact of a
higher credit reserve build and an increase in net credit
losses partially offset by the impact of FX translation. In the first
half of the year, rising credit losses were particularly apparent in the
portfolios in India and South Korea. However, delinquencies improved in recent
periods and net credit losses flattened as the region showed early signs of
economic recovery and increased levels of customer activity. 

24  

2008 vs.
2007    Revenues, net of interest
expense   increased 4%, driven by
higher cards purchase sales and higher loan and deposit volumes, partially
offset by lower gains on Visa shares than the prior year and a 47% decline in
investment sales.            Net interest revenue    was 13% higher than the prior year reflecting higher card balances,
higher average loans and deposits, and better spreads.            Non-interest revenue    declined 11%, primarily due to the lower gains on Visa shares than the
prior year and the decline in investment sales, partially offset by higher cards
purchase sales.           Operating expenses   
increased 11%, reflecting higher business volume and restructuring expenses in
2008.           Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims    increased 64%, mainly due to higher net
credit losses and higher credit reserve builds, reflective of the overall
economic environment in the region.  

2010
Outlook    The 2010
performance of  Asia RCB  will continue to
be driven by improving macroeconomic conditions in the region, supported by
continued investment spending in the business and product capability.  Asia RCB  anticipates continued investment in
expanded retail distribution, an enhanced wealth management offering and
increased expenditure on card promotion and account acquisition, which could
result in an increase in year-on-year expenses. While  Asia RCB  currently expects credit trends,
including declining net credit losses and improving delinquencies, to continue
in 2010, credit trends in the region will also be affected by the pace of
recovery in the U.S. and European Union.

2009 vs.
2008      Revenues, net of interest expense   
increased 11% or $2.7 billion, as markets began to recover in the early part of
2009, bringing back higher levels of volume activity and higher levels of
liquidity, which began to decline again in the third quarter of 2009. The growth
in revenue in the early part of the year was mainly due to a $7.1 billion
increase in fixed income markets, reflecting strong trading opportunities across
all asset classes in the first half of 2009, and a $1.5 billion increase in
investment banking revenue primarily from increases in debt and equity
underwriting activities reflecting higher transaction volumes from depressed
2008 levels. These increases were offset by a $6.4 billion decrease in lending
revenue primarily from losses on credit default swap hedges. Excluding the 2009
and 2008 CVA impact, as indicated in the table below, revenues increased 23% or
$5.5 billion. 

                Operating expenses
   decreased 17%, or $2.7 billion. Excluding the 2008 repositioning and
restructuring charges and the 2009 litigation reserve release, operating
expenses declined 11% or $1.6 billion, mainly as a result of headcount
reductions and benefits from expense
management.         Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims   
decreased 7% or $129 million, to $1.7 billion, mainly due to lower credit
reserve builds and net credit losses, due to an improved credit environment,
particularly in the latter part of the year.  

2008 vs.
2007      Revenues, net of interest expense   
decreased 2% or $0.4 billion reflecting the overall difficult market conditions.
Excluding the 2008 and 2007 CVA impact, revenues decreased 3% or $0.6 billion.
The reduction in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in investment banking
revenue of $2.3 billion to $3.2 billion, mainly in debt and equity underwriting,
reflecting lower volumes, and a decrease in equity markets revenue of $2.3
billion to $2.9 billion due to extremely high volatility and reduced levels of
activity. These reductions were offset by an increase in fixed income markets of
$2.9 billion to $14.4 billion due to strong performance in interest rates and
currencies, and an increase in lending revenue of $2.4 billion to $4.2 billion
mainly from gains on credit default swap
hedges.          Operating expenses   
decreased by 2% or $0.4 billion. Excluding the 2008 and 2007 repositioning and
restructuring charges and the 2007 litigation reserve reversal, operating
expenses decreased by 7% or $1.1 billion driven by headcount reduction and lower
performance-based incentives.         Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and
claims    increased $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion mainly from higher credit
reserve builds and net credit losses offset by a lower provision for unfunded
lending commitments due to deterioration in the credit
environment. 

Certain
Revenues Impacting Securities and Banking   Items
that impacted  S B  revenues during
2009 and 2008 are set forth in the table below.

      collateral has weighted average FICO scores between 680 and 720 or (ii)
      for instances where FICO scores are greater than 720, RMBS have 30% or
      less of the underlying collateral composed of full documentation loans.

                 S B  s     commercial real estate exposure is
      split into three categories of assets: held at fair value;
      held-to-maturity/held-for-investment; and equity. See  Managing Global
      Risk Credit Risk Exposure to Commercial Real Estate  section for a further
      discussion.  

In the table above, 2009 includes a $330 million pretax adjustment to the
CVA balance, which reduced pretax revenues for the year, reflecting a correction
of an error related to prior periods. See   Significant Accounting
Policies and Significant Estimates     below and Notes 1
and 34 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of this
adjustment. 

2010
Outlook     The 2010 outlook for  S B  will depend on the
level of client activity and on macroeconomic conditions, market valuations and
volatility, interest rates and other market factors. Management of    S B   
currently expects to maintain client activity throughout 2010 and to operate in
market conditions that offer moderate volatility and increased
liquidity.         Operating expenses will benefit from continued re-engineering and expense
management initiatives, but will be offset by investments in talent and
infrastructure to support growth.

TRANSACTION SERVICES  

Transaction Services   
is composed of Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities and Fund
Services (SFS). TTS provides comprehensive cash management and trade finance for
corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities worldwide. SFS
provides custody and funds services to investors such as insurance companies and
mutual funds, clearing services to intermediaries such as broker-dealers, and

2009 vs.
2008   

         Revenues,
net of interest expense  
declined 2% compared to 2008 as strong growth in balances was more than offset
by lower spreads driven by low interest rates globally.           Average deposits and other customer liability balances   
grew 8%, driven by strong growth in all regions.           Treasury and Trade Solutions    revenues grew 7% as a result of strong growth in balances and higher
trade revenues.           Securities and Funds Services    revenues declined 18%, attributable to reductions in asset valuations and
volumes.            Operating expenses   
declined 12%, mainly as a result of headcount reductions and successful
execution of reengineering initiatives.           Cost of credit   
declined 80%, which was primarily attributable to overall portfolio
management.           Net income   
increased 12%, leading to a record net income, with growth across all regions
reflecting benefits of continued re-engineering and expense management
efforts.  

2008 vs.
2007      Revenues, net of interest expense   
grew 23% driven by new business and implementations, growth in customer
liability balances, increased transaction volumes and the impact of
acquisitions.         Average deposits and other customer liability balances   
grew 14% driven by success of new business growth and
implementations.         Treasury and Trade Solutions    revenues grew 26% as a result of strong liability and fee growth as well
as increased client penetration.         Securities and Funds Services    revenues grew 17% as a result of increased assets under custody, volumes
and liability balances. 

2010
Outlook       Transaction Services   
business performance will continue to be impacted in 2010 by levels of interest
rates, economic activity, volatility in global capital markets, foreign exchange
and market valuations globally. Levels of client activity and client cash and
security flows are key factors dependent on macroeconomic conditions.  Transaction Services  intends to continue to
invest in technology to support its global network, as well as investments to
build out its investor services suite of products aimed at large,
under-penetrated markets for middle and back office outsourcing among a range of
investors. These and similar investments could lead to increasing operating
expenses.

CITI HOLDINGS  

Citi Holdings contains businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup
has determined are not central to its core Citicorp business. These noncore
businesses tend to be more asset-intensive and reliant on wholesale funding and
also may be product-driven rather than client-driven. Citi intends to exit these
businesses as quickly as practicable yet in an economically rational
manner through business divestitures, portfolio run-off and asset sales. Citi
has made substantial progress divesting and exiting businesses from Citi
Holdings, having completed 15 divestitures in 2009, including Smith Barney,
Nikko Cordial Securities, Nikko Asset Management Financial Institution Credit
Card business (FI) and Diners Club North America. Citi Holdings 
assets have been reduced by nearly 40%, or $351 billion, from the peak level of
$898 billion in the first quarter of 2008 to $547 billion at year-end 2009. Citi
Holdings  assets represented less than 30% of Citi s assets as of December 31,
2009. Asset reductions from Citi Holdings have the combined benefits of further
fortifying Citigroup s capital base, lowering risk, simplifying the organization
and allowing Citi to allocate capital to fund long-term strategic
businesses.          Citi Holdings consists
of the following businesses:    Brokerage and Asset Management; Local Consumer Lending;  and  Special Asset
Pool.         With Citi s exit from the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government
in December 2009, the Company conducted a broad review of the Citi Holdings
asset base to determine which assets are strategically important to Citicorp. As
a result of this analysis, approximately $61 billion of assets will be moved
from Citi Holdings into Citicorp in the first quarter of 2010. The assets
consist primarily of approximately $34 billion of U.S. mortgages that will be
transferred to    NA RCB   , approximately $19 billion of commercial and corporate loans and
securities related to core Citicorp clients, of which approximately $17 billion
will be moved to    S B   
and the remainder to    NA RCB   , and approximately $5.0 billion of assets related to Citi s Mexico
asset management business that will be moved to    LATAM RCB   .

BROKERAGE AND ASSET
MANAGEMENT  

Brokerage and Asset Management
(BAM)   , which constituted approximately 6% of Citi Holdings by assets as of
December 31, 2009, consists of Citi s global retail brokerage and asset
management businesses. This segment was substantially affected and reduced in
size in 2009 due to the divestitures of Smith Barney (to the Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB JV)) and Nikko Cordial Securities. At December
31, 2009,    BAM   
had approximately $35 billion of assets, which included $26 billion of assets
from the 49% interest in the MSSB JV ($13 billion investment and $13 billion in
loans associated with the clients of the MSSB JV) and $9 billion of assets from
a diverse set of asset management and insurance businesses of which
approximately half will be transferred into the    LATAM RCB    during the first quarter of 2010, as discussed under  Citi Holdings 
above. Morgan Stanley has options to purchase Citi s remaining stake in the MSSB
JV over three years starting in 2012. The 2009 results include an $11.1 billion
gain ($6.7 billion after-tax) on the sale of Smith Barney. 

NM Not

2009 vs.
2008   

         Revenues,
net of interest expense  
increased 80% versus the prior year mainly driven by the $11.1 billion pretax
gain on the sale ($6.7 billion after-tax) on the MSSB JV transaction in the
second quarter of 2009 and a $320 million pretax gain on the sale of the managed
futures business to the MSSB JV in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding these
gains, revenue decreased primarily due to the absence of Smith Barney from May
2009 onwards and the absence of fourth-quarter revenue of Nikko Asset
Management, partially offset by an improvement in marks in Retail Alternative
Investments.     Revenues   
in the prior year include a $347 million pretax gain on sale of CitiStreet and
charges related to the settlement of auction rate securities of $393 million
pretax.          Operating expenses   
decreased 64% from the prior year, mainly driven by the absence of Smith Barney
and Nikko Asset Management expenses, re-engineering efforts and the absence of
2008 one-time expenses ($0.9 billion intangible impairment, $0.2 billion of
restructuring and $0.5 billion of write-downs and other
charges).          Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims   
decreased 15% mainly reflecting a $50 million decrease in provision for benefits
and claims, partially offset by increased reserve builds of $28
million. 

Assets   
decreased 40% versus the prior year, mostly driven by the sales of Nikko Cordial
Securities and Nikko Asset Management ($25 billion) and the managed futures
business ($1.4 billion), partially offset by increased Smith Barney assets of $4
billion. 

2008 vs.
2007     Revenues, net of interest
expense    
decreased 21% from the prior year primarily due to lower transactional and
investment revenues in Smith Barney, lower revenues in Nikko Asset Management
and higher markdowns in Retail Alternative
Investments.          Operating expenses   
increased 16% versus the prior year, mainly driven by a $0.9 billion intangible
impairment in Nikko Asset Management in the fourth quarter of 2008, $0.2 billion
of restructuring charges and $0.5 billion of write-downs and other
charges.          Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims   
increased $65 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to a $52 million
increase in provisions for benefits and claims.            Assets   
increased 4% versus the prior year.

LOCAL CONSUMER LENDING  

Local Consumer Lending
(LCL)   , which constituted approximately 65% of Citi Holdings by assets as of
December 31, 2009, includes a portion of Citigroup s North American mortgage
business, retail partner cards, Western European cards and retail banking,
CitiFinancial North America, Primerica, Student Loan Corporation and other local
consumer finance businesses globally. At December 31, 2009,    LCL   
had $358 billion of assets ($317 billion in    North America   ). About one-half of the assets in    LCL   
as of December 31, 2009 consisted of U.S. mortgages in the company s
CitiMortgage and CitiFinancial operations. The North American assets consist of
residential mortgage loans, retail partner card loans, student loans, personal
loans, auto loans, commercial real estate, and other consumer loans and
assets.

2009 vs.
2008   

         Revenues,
net of interest expense  
decreased 22% versus the prior year, mostly due to lower net interest revenue.
    Net interest revenue   
was 23% lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower balances, de-risking
of the portfolio, and spread compression.    Net interest revenue   
as a percentage of average loans decreased 63 basis points from the prior year,
primarily due to the impact of higher delinquencies, interest write-offs, loan
modification programs, higher FDIC charges and CARD Act implementation (in the
latter part of 2009),  partially offset by retail partner cards pricing
actions.  LCL  results will continue to be
impacted by the CARD Act. Citi currently estimates that the net impact on  LCL  revenues for 2010 could be a reduction of
approximately $50 to $150 million. See also   North America Regional Consumer Banking  
and  Managing Global Risk Credit Risk  for additional information on the
impact of the CARD Act to Citi s credit card businesses  . Average loans decreased 12%, with    North America   
down 11% and international down 19%.    Non-interest revenue   
decreased $1.1 billion mostly driven by the impact of higher credit losses
flowing through the securitization
trusts.         Operating expenses   
declined 30% from the prior year, due to lower volumes and reductions from
expense re-engineering actions, and the impact of goodwill write-offs of $3.0
billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by higher other real
estate owned and collection costs. 

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and
claims  increased 14% versus the prior year reflecting an increase in net
credit losses of $6.1 billion,   partially offset by lower reserve builds of $2.7 billion. Higher net
credit losses were primarily driven by higher losses of $3.6 billion in
residential real estate lending, $1.0 billion in retail partner cards, and $0.7
billion in international.         Assets   
decreased $58 billion versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower
originations, wind-down of specific businesses, asset sales, divestitures,
write-offs and higher loan loss reserve balances. Key divestitures in 2009
included the FI credit card business, Italy consumer finance, Diners Europe,
Portugal cards, Norway consumer, and Diners Club North America. 

2008 vs.
2007      Revenues, net of interest expense   
decreased 9% versus the prior year, mostly due to lower    Non-interest revenue   .    Net interest revenue   
declined 1% versus the prior year. Average loans increased 3%; however, revenues
declined, driven by lower balances, de-risking of the portfolio, and spread
compression.    Non-interest revenue   
decreased $2 billion, primarily due to the impact of securitization in retail
partners cards and the mark-to-market on the mortgage servicing rights asset and
related hedge in real estate
lending.         Operating expenses   
increased 31%, driven by the impact of goodwill write-offs of $3.0 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and restructuring costs. Excluding one-time expenses,
expenses were slightly higher due to increased volumes. 

32  

Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims   
increased 76% versus the prior year reflecting increased net credit losses of
$6.4 billion and higher reserve builds of $3.1 billion. Higher net credit losses
were primarily driven by $3.9 billion in real estate lending and $0.8 billion in
retail partner cards.         Assets   
decreased $65 billion versus the prior year, primarily driven by Real Estate
Lending and higher loan loss reserve balances in 2008.

Japan
Consumer Finance     Citigroup continues to actively monitor a number of matters involving its
Japan Consumer Finance business, including customer refund claims and defaults,
as well as financial and legislative, regulatory, judicial and other political
developments, relating to the charging of  gray zone  interest. Gray zone
interest represents interest at rates that are legal but for which claims may
not be enforceable. This business has incurred and will continue to face net
credit losses and refunds, due in part to the impact of Japanese consumer
lending laws passed in the fourth quarter of 2006 and judicial and regulatory
actions. In addition, legislation effective in 2010 will impose a lower interest
rate cap and lower lending cap on consumer lending in Japan, which may reduce
credit availability and increase potential claims and losses relating to gray
zone interest. 

             Citi determined in 2008 to exit its Japanese Consumer Finance business
and has been liquidating its portfolio and otherwise winding down the business.
Citi continues to monitor and evaluate both currently and previously outstanding
accounts in its Japanese Consumer Finance business and its reserves related
thereto. However, the trend in the type, number and amount of claims, and the
potential full amount of losses and their impact on Citi requires evaluation in
a potentially volatile environment, is subject to significant uncertainties and
continues to be difficult to predict.

SPECIAL ASSET POOL  

Special Asset Pool (SAP)   , which constituted approximately 28% of Citi
Holdings by assets as of December 31, 2009, is a portfolio of securities, loans
and other assets that Citigroup intends to actively reduce over time through
asset sales and portfolio run-off. At December 31, 2009,    SAP    had $154
billion of assets.    SAP    assets have
declined by $197 billion or 56% from peak levels in 2007 reflecting cumulative
write-downs, asset sales and portfolio run-off. Assets have been reduced by $87
billion from year-ago levels. Approximately 60% of    SAP    assets are now
accounted for on an accrual basis, which has helped reduce income
volatility.

2009 vs.
2008      Revenues, net of interest expense    increased $35.9 billion in 2009, primarily
due to the absence of significant negative revenue marks occurring in the prior
year. Total negative marks were $1.9 billion in 2009 as compared to $38.1
billion in 2008, as described in more detail below. Revenue in the current
year included a positive $1.3 billion CVA on derivative positions, excluding
monoline insurers, and positive marks of $0.8 billion on subprime-related direct
exposures. These positive revenues were partially offset by negative revenues of
$1.5 billion on Alt-A mortgages, $1.3 billion of write-downs on commercial real
estate, and a negative $1.6 billion CVA on the monoline insurers and fair value
option liabilities. Revenue was also affected by negative marks on private
equity positions and write-downs on highly leveraged finance
commitments.         Operating expenses   
decreased 9% in 2009, mainly driven by lower compensation and lower volumes and
transaction expenses, partially offset by costs associated with the U.S.
government loss-sharing agreement, which Citi exited in the fourth quarter of
2009.         Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and
claims    increased $1.5
billion, primarily driven by $4.5 billion in increased net credit losses,
partially offset by a lower reserve build of $3.0
billion.         Assets    declined 36%
versus the prior year, primarily driven by amortization and prepayments, sales,
marks and charge-offs. Asset sales during the fourth quarter of 2009 ($10
billion) were executed at or above Citi s marks generating $800 million in
pretax gains for the quarter. 

2008 vs.
2007      Revenues, net of interest expense    decreased $21.7 billion, primarily due to
negative net revenue marks. Revenue included $14.3 billion of write-downs on
subprime-related direct exposures and a negative $6.8 billion CVA related to the
monoline insurers and derivative positions. Revenue was also negatively affected
by write-downs on highly leveraged finance commitments, Alt-A mortgage revenue,
write-downs on structured investment vehicles and commercial real estate, and
mark-to-market on auction rate securities. Total negative marks were $38.1
billion in 2008 as compared to $20.2 billion in 2007, which are described in
more detail below.         Operating expenses   
decreased 8%, mainly driven by lower compensation and transaction
expenses.         Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and
claims    increased $2.7
billion, primarily due to a $2.2 billion increase in the reserve build and an
increase in net credit losses of $0.5
billion.         Assets    declined 31%
versus the prior year, primarily driven by amortization and prepayments, sales,
and marks and charge-offs.

      recorded in    BAM   ) arising from the ARS legal
      settlements.  

Credit
Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Related to Monoline
Insurers     CVA is
calculated by applying forward default probabilities, which are derived using
the counterparty s current credit spread, to the expected exposure profile. The
exposure primarily relates to hedges on super-senior subprime exposures that
were executed with various monoline insurance companies. See  Managing Global
Risk   Credit
Risk Direct Exposure to Monolines  for further discussion. 

Credit
Valuation Adjustment on Citi s Debt Liabilities for Which Citi Has Elected the
Fair       Value
Option           Citi is required to use its own credit spreads
in determining the current value for its derivative liabilities and all other
liabilities for which it has elected the fair value option. When Citi s credit
spreads widen (deteriorate), Citi recognizes a gain on these liabilities because
the value of the liabilities has decreased. When Citi s credit spreads narrow
(improve), Citi recognizes a loss on these liabilities because the value of the
liabilities has increased. The approximately $252 million of losses recorded in
   SAP    on its fair value option liabilities
(excluding derivative liabilities) during 2009 was principally due to the
maturing of debt on which Citi has elected the fair value option. 

Credit
Valuation Adjustment on Derivative Positions, Excluding Monoline
Insurers     The
approximately $1,283 million net gain in derivative positions held in
   SAP    during 2009 was due to the narrowing spreads
of Citi s counterparties on its derivative assets. See  Derivatives Fair
Valuation Adjustments for Derivatives  for further discussion. 

Accretion
on Reclassified Assets     In the fourth quarter of 2008, Citi Holdings reclassified $33.3 billion
of debt securities within  SAP  from
trading securities to HTM investments, $4.7 billion of debt securities from
trading securities to AFS, and $15.7 billion of loans from held-for-sale to
held-for-investment. All assets were reclassified with an amortized cost equal
to the fair value on the date of reclassification. The difference between the
amortized cost basis and the expected principal cash flows is treated as a
purchase discount and accreted into income over the remaining life of the
security or loan. All of these reclassified debt securities and loans are held
in    SAP   . During 2009,    SAP    recognized
approximately $1,994 million of interest revenue from this
accretion. 

37  

CORPORATE/OTHER  

Corporate/Other   
includes global staff functions (includes finance, risk, human resources, legal
and compliance) and other corporate expense, global operations and technology
(O T), residual Corporate Treasury and Corporate items. At December 31,
2009, this segment had approximately $230 billion of assets, consisting
primarily of the Company s liquidity portfolio, including $110 billion of cash
and cash equivalents. 

2009 vs.
2008      Revenues, net of interest expense    declined, primarily due to the pretax loss on
debt extinguishment related to the repayment of the $20 billion of TARP trust
preferred securities and the pretax loss in connection with the exit from the
loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government. Revenues also declined, due to
the absence of the 2008 sale of Citigroup Global Services Limited recorded in
O T. This was partially offset by a pretax gain related to the exchange
offers, revenues and higher intersegment eliminations.           Operating
expenses    increased,
primarily due to intersegment eliminations and increases in compensation,
partially offset by lower repositioning reserves. 

2008 vs.
2007      Revenues, net of interest expense    increased primarily due to the gain in 2007
on the sale of certain corporate-owned assets and higher intersegment
eliminations, partially offset by improved Treasury hedging
activities.         Operating expenses   
declined, primarily due to lower restructuring charges in 2008 as well as
reductions in incentive compensation and benefits expense.

BALANCE SHEET REVIEW  

Loans     Loans are an extension of credit to
individuals, corporations, or government institutions. Loans vary across regions
and industries and primarily include credit cards, mortgages, other real estate
lending, personal loans, auto loans, student loans, and corporate loans. The
majority of loans are carried at cost with a minimal amount recorded at fair
value.          Consumer and corporate loans
comprised 72% and 28%, respectively, of Citi s total loans (net of unearned
income and before the allowance for loan losses) as of December 31,
2009.          During 2009, consumer loans (net of
allowance for loan losses) decreased by $64 billion, or 14%, primarily due to
a: 

$33 billion, or 12%, decrease in
  mortgage and real estate loans; and 
           
          $17 billion, or 19%, decrease in
  credit card loans, mostly in the U.S.   
       
               These decreases were driven by
tightened lending standards and credit activity during the year.          During 2009, corporate loans
decreased $46 billion, or 22%, primarily driven by a decrease of $21 billion, or
20%, in commercial and industrial loans.          During 2009, average consumer loans
(net of unearned income) of $456 billion yielded an average rate of 7.8%,
compared to $513 billion and 8.9% in the prior year. Average corporate loans of
$190 billion yielded an average rate of 6.3% in 2009, compared to $221 billion
and 7.7% in the prior year.          For further
information, see  Loans Outstanding  under  Managing Global Risk Credit Risk 
and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Trading
Account Assets (Liabilities)      Trading account assets    include debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a
receivable position, residual interests in securitizations, and physical
commodities inventory. In addition, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to
carry at fair value, such as certain loans and purchase guarantees, are also
included in    Trading account assets   .    Trading account liabilities    include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and
derivatives in a net payable position as well as certain liabilities that
Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value.          All    Trading account assets    and    Trading account liabilities    are reported at their fair value, except for
physical commodities inventory which is carried at the lower of cost or market,
with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current income.          During 2009,    Trading account assets    decreased by $35 billion, or 9%, due to a: 

$56 billion, or 49%, decrease in
  revaluation gains primarily consisting of decreases in interest rate and
  foreign exchange contracts as well as a decrease in netting agreements; 
           
          $16 billion, or 30%, decrease in
  mortgage loan securities driven by decreased agency and subprime debt; 
           
          $20 billion, or 172%, increase in
  U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities; 
           
          $15 billion, or 27%, increase in
  foreign government securities; and 
           
          $7 billion, or 9%, increase in
  corporate and other debt securities.   

39  

Total average    Trading account assets    were $267 billion in 2009, compared to $373 billion in 2008, yielding
average rates of 4.0% and 4.7%,
respectively.        During 2009,    Trading account liabilities    decreased by $28 billion, or 17%, due to a: 

$51 billion, or 44%, decrease in
  revaluation losses primarily due to   decreases in interest rate, foreign exchange and equity contracts as
  well as   a decrease in netting
  agreements; and 
           
          $23 billion, or 45%, increase in
  securities sold, not yet purchased,   comprised of an $18 billion increase in debt securities, with U.S.
  Treasury   securities increasing
  by $5 billion.   
       
             In 2009, average    Trading account liabilities    were $60 billion, yielding an average rate of 0.5%, compared to $75
billion and 1.7% in the prior
year.        For further discussion regarding    Trading account assets    and    Trading account liabilities   , see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

Federal
Funds Sold (Purchased) and Securities Borrowed (Loaned) or Purchased (Sold)
      Under
Agreements to Resell (Repurchase)           Federal funds sold and federal funds purchased
consist of unsecured advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at
Federal Reserve banks. When Citigroup advances federal funds to a third party,
it is selling its excess reserves. Similarly, when Citigroup receives federal
funds, it is purchasing reserves from a third party. These interest-bearing
transactions typically have an original maturity of one business
day.        Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of
cash advanced or received, with a minimal amount adjusted for fair value. With
respect to securities borrowed, Citi pays cash collateral in an amount in excess
of the market value of securities borrowed, and receives excess in the case of
securities loaned. Citigroup monitors the market value of securities borrowed
and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral advanced or obtained as
necessary. Interest received or paid for these transactions is recorded in
interest income or interest
expense.        Securities purchased under agreements to
resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as
collateralized financing transactions and are primarily carried at fair value
since January 1, 2007. Citigroup s policy is to take possession of securities
purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be
repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where
appropriate to protect against credit
exposure.        During 2009, the increase of $38 billion, or
21%, in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements
to resell, and the decrease of $51 billion, or 25%, in federal funds purchased
and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase were primarily
driven by Citi s liquidity management objective of increasing cash and liquid
securities positions.        For further information regarding these
balance sheet categories, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

Investments      Investments    consist
of debt and equity securities that are available-for-sale, debt securities that
are held-to-maturity, non-marketable equity securities that are carried at fair
value, and non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. Debt securities
include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock, as well as loan-backed
securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) and other structured notes.
Marketable and non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value include
common and nonredeemable preferred stock. These instruments provide Citi with
long-term investment opportunities while in most cases remaining relatively
liquid.        Non-marketable equity securities carried at cost primarily include equity
shares issued by the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank that
Citigroup is required to hold.        Investment securities classified as
available-for-sale are primarily carried at fair value with the changes in fair
value generally recognized in stockholders  equity (accumulated other
comprehensive income). Declines in fair value that are deemed
other-than-temporary, as well as gains and losses from the sale of these
investment securities, are recognized in current earnings. Certain investments
in non-marketable equity securities and certain investments that would otherwise
be accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value. Changes in
fair value of such investments are recorded in earnings. Debt securities
classified as held-to-maturity are carried at cost unless a decline in fair
value below cost is deemed other-than-temporary, in which case such a decline is
recorded in current earnings.        During 2009, investments increased by $50
billion, or 20%, principally due to a: 

$64 billion increase in
  available-for-sale securities (U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities,
  $30 billion; foreign governments, $22 billion; and corporate, $10 billion);
  and 
           
          $13 billion decrease in
  held-to-maturity securities (predominantly asset-backed securities). 

For further information regarding investments, see Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other
Assets      Other assets    are
composed of cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables,
goodwill, intangibles, and various other assets.          During 2009,    Other assets   
decreased $24 billion, or 5%, due to a: 

$11 billion decrease in
     Brokerage receivables   , driven by the absence of   unsettled customer trades as markets have
  become more liquid; 
           
          $5 billion decrease in
     Intangible assets    and $2 billion decrease in    Goodwill   ,
  predominantly from the sale of Nikko Cordial Securities and   Nikko Asset Management and the MSSB JV with
  Morgan Stanley; 
           
          $3 billion decrease in
     Deposits with banks   , from decreased deposits with   the Federal Reserve used to purchase highly
  liquid securities; and 
           
          $5 billion decrease in various
  other assets.   

For further information regarding    Goodwill    and  Intangible assets , see Note
19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion on
   Brokerage receivables   , see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

40  

Deposits     Deposits represent customer funds that are
payable on demand or upon maturity. The majority of deposits are carried at
cost, with a minimal amount recorded at fair value. Deposits can be
interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing. Interest-bearing deposits payable by
foreign and U.S. domestic banking subsidiaries of Citigroup comprise 58% and 28%
of total deposits, respectively, while non-interest-bearing deposits comprise 5%
and 9% of total deposits,
respectively.        During 2009, total deposits increased by $62
billion, or 8%.   Total average
deposits increased $10 billion or 1% during 2009. 

             For more information on deposits, see  Capital Resources and
Liquidity Liquidity.  

Debt     Debt is composed of both short-term and
long-term borrowings. It includes commercial paper, borrowings from unaffiliated
banks, senior notes (including collateralized advances from the Federal Home
Loan Bank), subordinated notes and trust preferred securities. The majority of
debt is carried at cost, with approximately $27 billion recorded at fair
value.        During 2009, total debt decreased by $53 billion, or 11%, with
   Short-term borrowings    decreasing by $58 billion, or 46%.
   Long-term debt    increased by only $5 billion, or
1%.        The decrease in    Short-term borrowings    was due to a decline of $39 billion in other funds borrowed and $19
billion in commercial paper primarily caused by decreased need for short-term
funding due to excess liquidity caused by increased deposits and a reduction in
assets.        Average commercial paper outstanding in 2009 was $25 billion with an
average rate of 1.0%, compared to $32 billion and 3.1% in 2008. Average other
funds borrowed in 2009 were $77 billion, with an average rate of 1.5%, compared
to $83 billion and 1.7% in the prior
year.        Average long-term debt outstanding during 2009 was $345 billion, compared
to $348 billion in 2008, with an average rate of 3.6% and 4.6%,
respectively.        For more information on debt, see Note 20 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and  Capital Resources and
Liquidity Liquidity.

SEGMENT BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31,
2009  

The above supplemental information
reflects Citigroup s consolidated GAAP balance sheet by reporting segment as of
December 31, 2009. The respective segment information closely depicts the assets
and liabilities managed by each segment as of such date. While this presentation
is not defined by GAAP, Citi believes that these non-GAAP financial measures
enhance investors  understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the
underlying business segments, as well as the beneficial interrelationship of the
asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among Citi s
business segments.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND
LIQUIDITY  

CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Overview     Capital has historically been generated by
earnings from Citi s operating businesses. Citi may also augment its capital
through issuances of common stock, convertible preferred stock, preferred stock,
equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans, and, in the case of
regulatory capital, through the issuance of subordinated debt underlying trust
preferred securities. In addition, the impact of future events on Citi s
business results, such as corporate and asset dispositions, as well as changes
in accounting standards, also affect Citi s capital
levels.        Generally, capital is used primarily to support assets in Citi s
businesses and to absorb market, credit, or operational losses. While capital
may be used for other purposes, such as to pay dividends or repurchase common
stock, Citi s ability to utilize its capital for these purposes is currently
restricted due to its agreements with the U.S. government, generally for so long
as the U.S. government continues to hold Citi s common stock or trust preferred
securities. See also  Supervision and Regulation 
below.        Citigroup s capital management framework is designed to ensure that
Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent
with Citi s risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines,
as well as external rating agency considerations. The capital management process
is centrally overseen by senior management and is reviewed at the consolidated,
legal entity, and country level.        Senior management is responsible for the
capital management process mainly through Citigroup s Finance and Asset and
Liability Committee (FinALCO), with oversight from the Risk Management and
Finance Committee of Citigroup s Board of Directors. The FinALCO is composed of
the senior-most management of Citigroup for the purpose of engaging management
in decision-making and related discussions on capital and liquidity matters.
Among other things, FinALCO s responsibilities include: determining the
financial structure of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries; ensuring that
Citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized in consultation
with its regulators; determining appropriate asset levels and return hurdles for
Citigroup and individual businesses; reviewing the funding and capital markets
plan for Citigroup; and monitoring interest rate risk, corporate and bank
liquidity, and the impact of currency translation on non-U.S. earnings and
capital.  

Capital
Ratios     Citigroup
is subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve
Board. Historically, capital adequacy has been measured, in part, based on two
risk-based capital ratios, the Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital
+ Tier 2 Capital) ratios. Tier 1 Capital consists of the sum of  core capital
elements,  such as qualifying common stockholders  equity, as adjusted,
qualifying noncontrolling interests, and qualifying mandatorily redeemable
securities of subsidiary trusts, principally reduced by goodwill, other
disallowed intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets. Total Capital
also includes  supplementary  Tier 2 Capital elements, such as qualifying
subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit losses. Both
measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.
Further, in conjunction with the conduct of the 2009 Supervisory Capital
Assessment Program (SCAP), U.S. banking regulators developed a new measure of
capital termed  Tier 1 Common,  which has been defined as Tier 1 Capital less
non-common elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying
noncontrolling interests, and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of
subsidiary trusts.        Citigroup s risk-weighted assets are
principally derived from application of the risk-based capital guidelines
related to the measurement of credit risk. Pursuant to these guidelines,
on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent amount of certain
off-balance-sheet exposures (such as financial guarantees, unfunded lending
commitments, letters of credit, and derivatives) are assigned to one of several
prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit risk
associated with the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor, the nature of the
collateral, or external credit ratings.   Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on
covered trading account positions and all foreign exchange and commodity
positions whether or not carried in the trading account. Excluded from
risk-weighted assets are any assets, such as goodwill and deferred tax assets,
to the extent required to be deducted from regulatory capital. See  Components
of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelines 
below.        Citigroup is also subject to a Leverage ratio requirement, a
non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, which is defined as Tier 1 Capital
as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total
assets.         To be  well capitalized  under federal bank
regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital
ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage
ratio of at least 3%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to
maintain higher capital levels. The following table sets forth Citigroup s
regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008. 

Citigroup
Regulatory Capital Ratios   

As noted in the table above, Citigroup was  well capitalized  under the
federal bank regulatory agency definitions at year end for both 2009 and
2008.

      available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair
      values, in accordance with risk-based capital guidelines. In arriving at
      Tier 1 Capital, banking organizations are required to deduct net
      unrealized losses on available-for-sale equity securities with readily
      determinable fair values, net of tax. Banking organizations are permitted
      to include in Tier 2 Capital up to 45% of net unrealized pretax gains on

              (5)  
                 
              Of Citi s approximately $46 billion of net deferred tax assets at
      December 31, 2009, approximately $15 billion of such assets were
      includable without limitation in regulatory capital pursuant to risk-based
      capital guidelines, while approximately $26 billion of such assets
      exceeded the limitation imposed by these guidelines and, as  disallowed
      deferred tax assets,  were deducted in arriving at Tier 1 Capital.
      Citigroup s other approximately $5 billion of net deferred tax assets
      primarily represented approximately $3 billion of deferred tax effects of
      unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and
      approximately $2 billion of deferred tax effects of the pension liability
      adjustment, which are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the
      amount of net deferred tax assets subject to limitation under the
      guidelines. Citi had approximately $24 billion of disallowed deferred tax
      assets at December 31, 2008.  
            
              (6)

              (7)  
                 
              Includes qualifying subordinated debt in an amount not exceeding

              (8)  
                       
              Includes risk-weighted credit equivalent amounts, net of applicable
      bilateral netting agreements, of $64.5 billion for interest rate,
      commodity, and equity derivative contracts, foreign exchange contracts,
      and credit derivatives as of December 31, 2009, compared with $102.9
      billion as of December 31, 2008. Market risk equivalent assets included in
      risk-weighted assets amounted to $80.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and
      $101.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Risk-weighted assets also include the
      effect of certain other off-balance-sheet exposures, such as unused
      lending commitments and letters of credit, and reflect deductions such as
      certain intangible assets and any excess allowance for credit
      losses.

2009
Actions Significantly Impacting Citigroup s
Capital     Primarily as a result of the preferred stock and trust preferred
securities exchange offers consummated in the third quarter of 2009, and capital
raised in connection with the $20 billion TARP repayment as well as
the exiting of the loss-sharing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2009, the
overall quality of Citigroup s capital was enhanced, with Tier 1 Common
increasing by approximately $82 billion from December 31, 2008 to December 31,
2009. In addition, Citigroup s Tangible Common Equity (TCE) increased by
approximately $87 billion from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Tier 1
Common and related capital adequacy ratios are measures used and relied upon by
U.S. banking regulators, while TCE is a capital adequacy metric used and relied
upon by industry analysts. However, both metrics and related ratios are
considered  non-GAAP financial measures  for SEC purposes. See  Capital Ratios, 
 Components of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelines,  and  Tangible Common
Equity  for additional information on these measures. 

2009
Actions Significantly Impacting Citigroup s Risk-Weighted
Assets     In the
fourth quarter of 2009, Citigroup entered into an agreement to exit the
loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. Treasury, FDIC, and Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, which covered losses on a specifically designated portfolio,
principally comprised of consumer assets, and initially valued at approximately
$301 billion as of November 21, 2008. Under the agreement, these designated
assets had been risk-weighted at 20% for purposes of calculating Citi s
risk-based capital ratios. With the exiting of the agreement, commencing
December 31, 2009, Citigroup discontinued risk-weighting these assets at 20%.
Rather, the assets were risk-weighted as required in accordance with risk-based
capital guidelines, as described above, and consistent to that prior to entering
into the agreement. The exiting of the loss-sharing agreement increased
Citigroup s risk-weighted assets by approximately $136 billion, and
correspondingly decreased Citi s Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital, and Total
Capital ratios by approximately 125 basis points, approximately 157 basis
points, and approximately 183 basis points, respectively, at December 31,
2009.        In addition, during the first half of 2009, all three of Citigroup s
primary credit card securitization trusts   the Master Trust,
Omni Trust, and Broadway Trust had bonds placed on ratings watch with negative
implications by rating agencies. As a result of the ratings watch status,
certain actions were taken by Citi with respect to each of the trusts. In
general, the actions subordinated certain senior interests in the trust assets
that were retained by Citi, which effectively placed these interests below
investor interests in terms of priority of
payment.        As a result of these actions, based on the
applicable regulatory capital rules, Citigroup began including the sold assets
for all three of the credit card securitization trusts in its risk-weighted
assets for purposes of calculating its risk-based capital ratios during 2009.
The increase in risk-weighted assets occurred in the quarter during 2009 in
which the respective actions took place. The effect of these changes increased
Citigroup s risk-weighted assets by approximately $82 billion, and decreased
Citigroup s Tier 1 Capital ratio 

by approximately 100
basis points each as of March 31, 2009, with respect to the Master and Omni
Trusts. The inclusion of the Broadway Trust increased Citigroup s risk-weighted
assets by an additional approximate $900 million at June 30, 2009. All bond
ratings for each of the trusts have been affirmed by the rating agencies, and no
downgrades had occurred as of December 31, 2009. 

2010
Accounting Changes Significantly Impacting Citigroup s Capital   Elimination
of Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) and Changes in the Consolidation
Model for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)     Changes that the FASB adopted in 2009
regarding sales treatment for assets and consolidation of off-balance-sheet
VIEs, as promulgated in SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, respectively, will have a
significant and immediate impact on Citigroup s capital ratios beginning in the
first quarter of 2010. Specifically, the pro forma impact on Citigroup s capital
ratios of the adoption on January 1, 2010 of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167 (based on
financial information as of December 31, 2009) would be as follows:

Common
Stockholders  Equity     Citigroup s common stockholders  equity increased during 2009 by $81.4
billion to $152.4 billion, and represented 8.2% of total assets as of December
31, 2009. Citigroup s common stockholders  equity was $71.0 billion, which
represented 3.7% of total assets, at December 31,
2008.        The table below summarizes the change in Citigroup s common stockholders 
equity during 2009:  

(1)  

Net loss includes a $0.9 billion after-tax gain related
      to the conversion of trust preferred securities held by public investors
      into common stock, pursuant to Citi s public and private exchange offers
      consummated in July 2009 and completed in their entirety in September
      2009.  
            
              (2)  
                       
              Net loss includes a $6.2 billion after-tax loss associated
      with the $20 billion TARP repayment as well as the exiting of the
      loss-sharing agreement in December
2009.  

45  

As of December 31, 2009, approximately $6.7 billion of stock repurchases
remained under Citi s authorized repurchase programs. No material repurchases
were made in 2009 or 2008. In addition, for so long as the U.S. government holds
any Citigroup common stock or trust preferred securities acquired pursuant to
the preferred stock exchange offers, Citigroup has agreed not to acquire,
repurchase, or redeem any Citigroup equity or trust preferred securities, other
than pursuant to administering its employee benefit plans or other customary
exceptions, or with the consent of the U.S. government. See also  Supervision
and Regulation.   

Tangible
Common Equity     TCE, as defined by Citigroup, represents    Common equity  less  Goodwill
   and    Intangible assets    (   other than Mortgage Servicing Rights
(MSRs)   ) net of the related
net deferred taxes. Other companies may calculate TCE in a manner different from
that of Citigroup. Citi s TCE was $118.2 billion and $31.1 billion at December
31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.        The TCE ratio (TCE divided by risk-weighted
assets) was 10.9% and 3.1% at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.          A reconciliation of Citigroup s
total stockholders  equity to TCE follows: 

Capital
Resources of Citigroup s Depository Institutions     Citigroup s U.S. subsidiary depository
institutions are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by their
respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the
guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board. To be  well capitalized  under these
regulatory definitions, Citigroup s depository institutions must have a Tier 1
Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital)
ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject
to a regulatory directive to meet and maintain higher capital
levels.        At December 31, 2009, all of Citigroup s subsidiary depository
institutions were  well capitalized  under federal bank regulatory agency
definitions, including Citigroup s primary depository institution, Citibank,
N.A., as noted in the following table:  

Citibank,
N.A. Components of Capital and Ratios Under Regulatory
Guidelines   

(1)  
                       
              Tier 1 Capital divided by each period s quarterly adjusted average
      total assets.  

Citibank, N.A. had a $2.8 billion net loss for 2009. In addition, during
2009, Citibank, N.A. received capital contributions from its immediate parent
company, Citicorp, in the amount of $33.0 billion. Total subordinated notes
issued to Citibank, N.A. s immediate parent company, Citicorp, included in
Citibank, N.A. s Tier 2 Capital declined from $28.2 billion outstanding at
December 31, 2008 to $4.0 billion outstanding at December 31, 2009, reflecting
the redemption of $24.2 billion of subordinated notes during 2009.

46  

The following table
presents the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup s and Citibank, N.A. s capital
ratios to changes of $100 million in Tier 1 Common, Tier 1 Capital, or Total
Capital (numerator), or changes of $1 billion in risk-weighted assets or
adjusted average total assets (denominator) based on financial information as of
December 31, 2009. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the
impact that a change in Citigroup s and  

Citibank, N.A. s financial position or results
of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a
single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, or
adjusted average total assets. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one
factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in this
table. 

Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries     At December 31, 2009, Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., had net capital, computed
in accordance with the SEC s net capital rule, of $10.9 billion, which exceeded
the minimum requirement by $10.2 billion. 

               In addition, certain of Citi s
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the other countries in
which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of
net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup s broker-dealer subsidiaries were in
compliance with their capital requirements at December 31, 2009. The
requirements applicable to these subsidiaries in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions may be subject to political uncertainty and potential change in
light of the recent financial crisis and regulatory reform proposals currently
being considered at both the legislative and regulatory
levels. 

Regulatory
Capital Standards Developments     Citigroup supports the move to a new set of
risk-based capital standards, published on June 26, 2004 (and subsequently
amended in November 2005) by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
consisting of central banks and bank supervisors from 13 countries. The
international version of the Basel II framework will allow Citigroup to leverage
internal risk models used to measure credit, operational, and market risk
exposures to drive regulatory capital calculations.  

             On December 7, 2007, the U.S. banking regulators published the rules for
large banks to comply with Basel II in the U.S. These rules require Citigroup,
as a large and internationally active bank, to comply with the most advanced
Basel II approaches for calculating credit and operational risk capital
requirements. The U.S. implementation timetable consists of a parallel
calculation period under the current regulatory capital regime (Basel I) and
Basel II, starting anytime between April 1, 2008 and April 1, 2010, followed by
a three-year transition period, typically starting 12 months after the beginning
of parallel reporting. U.S. regulators have reserved the right to change how
Basel II is applied in the U.S. following a review at the end of the second year
of the transitional period, and to retain the existing prompt corrective action
and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the
U.S. Citigroup intends to implement Basel II within the timeframe required by
the final rules. The Basel II (or its successor) requirements are the subject of
political uncertainty and potential tightening or other change in light of the
recent financial crisis and regulatory reform proposals currently being
considered at both the legislative and regulatory levels. See also  Risk
Factors.

FUNDING AND
LIQUIDITY 

General    Citigroup s cash flows and liquidity needs are
primarily generated within its operating subsidiaries.  Exceptions exist
for major corporate items, such as the TARP repayment, and for equity and
certain long-term debt issuances, which take place at the Citigroup corporate
level.  Generally, Citi s management of funding and liquidity is designed
to optimize availability of funds as needed within Citi s legal and regulatory
structure. Various constraints limit certain subsidiaries  ability to pay
dividends or otherwise make funds available.  Consistent with these
constraints, Citigroup s primary objectives for funding and liquidity management
are established by entity and in aggregate across three main operating entities,
as follows:  (i) Citigroup, as the parent holding company; (ii) banking
subsidiaries; and (iii) non-banking
subsidiaries.        Citigroup sources of funding include deposits,
collateralized financing transactions and a variety of unsecured short- and
long-term instruments, including federal funds purchased, commercial paper,
long-term debt, trust preferred securities, preferred stock and common
stock.         As a result of continued deleveraging, growth
in deposits, term securitization under government and non-government programs,
the issuance of long-term debt under the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
Program (TLGP) and the issuance of non-guaranteed debt (particularly during the
latter part of 2009), Citigroup substantially increased its balances of cash and
highly liquid securities and reduced its short-term borrowings during
2009.        Citi has focused on growing a geographically diverse retail and corporate
deposit base that stood at approximately $836 billion as of December 31, 2009,
up $62 billion compared to December 31, 2008. On a volume basis, deposit
increases occurred in  Regional
Consumer Banking , particularly in  North America , and in  Transaction Services  due to
growth in all regions and strength in Treasury and Trade Solutions. Excluding
the impact of foreign exchange, Citi s deposit base has increased sequentially
over each of the last six quarters. The deposits are diversified across products
and regions, with approximately 64% outside of the U.S.  This
diversification provides Citi with an important and low-cost source of funding.
A significant portion of these deposits has been, and is currently expected to
be, long-term and stable and is considered to be core. During 2010, although our
deposit balances may be subject to seasonal fluctuations, we anticipate pursuing
modest deposit growth while concentrating on widening spreads  . 

At December 31, 2009, long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for
Citigroup, Citigroup Global Market Holdings Inc. (CGMHI), Citigroup Funding Inc.
(CFI) and other Citigroup subsidiaries, collectively, were as
follows: 

The table below details the long-term debt issuances of Citigroup during
the past five quarters. 

(1)  
                      
              Includes
      $8.5 billion issued through the U.S. government-sponsored Department of
      Education Conduit Facility, and $1 billion issued by Citibank Pty. Ltd.
      Australia and guaranteed by the Commonwealth of Australia.  
            
              (2)  
                      
              Includes
      $3.3 billion issued through the U.S. government-sponsored Department of
      Education Conduit Facility, and $1 billion issued by Citibank Pty. Ltd.
      Australia and guaranteed by the Commonwealth of Australia.  
            
              (3)  
                      
              Includes
      $1.9 billion of senior debt issued under remarketing of $1.9 billion of
      Citigroup trust preferred securities held by the Abu Dhabi Investment
      Authority (ADIA) to provide funds for settlement of the forward stock
      purchase contract in March 2010, as provided for by the agreement between
      Citi and ADIA.  
            
              (4)  
                      
              Includes
      $1.4 billion issued through the U.S. government-sponsored Department of
      Education Conduit Facility.  

See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail
on Citigroup s and its affiliates  long-term debt and commercial paper
outstanding. Commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009 has decreased
from $29 billion as of December 31, 2008 to $10 billion. In 2010, commercial
paper is expected to continue to be an important source of funding for Citi,
maintained at approximately the $10 billion level. 

             The TLGP expired on October 31, 2009 and Citigroup and its affiliates
elected not to participate in any FDIC-approved extension of the program. In
addition, as of the end of 2009, Citigroup had substantially eliminated
 utilization of short-term government funding
programs. 

48 

In addition to growing its deposit base and engaging in long-term debt
funding, Citi has been actively building its structural liquidity by reducing
total assets. Total assets as of December 31, 2009 have declined 4% as compared
to December 31, 2008. Loans (net of allowance), which are one of Citi s most
illiquid assets, are down $109 billion, or approximately 15%. Deposits as a
percentage of loans have increased to 150% as of December 31, 2009 from 116% as
of December 31, 2008. Structural liquidity, defined as the  

sum of deposits,
long-term debt and stockholders  equity as a percentage of total assets, has
increased steadily through 2008   and 2009 and was 73% at December 31, 2009, as compared with 66% at
December 31, 2008. 

Aggregate Liquidity
Resources    

As noted in the table above,
Citigroup s aggregate liquidity resources totaled $315.5 billion as of December
31, 2009, compared with $200.3 billion as of December 31, 2008.  As of
December 31, 2009, Citigroup s and its affiliates  liquidity portfolio and
broker-dealer  cash box  totaled $86.8 billion as compared with $72.0 billion at
December 31, 2008. This includes the liquidity portfolio and cash box held in
the U.S. as well as government bonds held by Citigroup s broker-dealer entities
in the United Kingdom and Japan. Further, at December 31, 2009, Citigroup s bank
subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately $105.1 billion of cash on deposit
with major Central Banks (including the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
the European Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Japan,
the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority),
compared with approximately $74.5 billion at December 31, 2008. Citigroup s bank
subsidiaries also have significant additional liquidity resources through
unencumbered highly liquid securities available for secured funding through
private markets or that are, or could be, pledged to the major Central Banks and
the U.S. Federal Home Loan Banks.  The value of these liquid securities was
$123.6 billion at December 31, 2009 compared with $53.8 billion at December 31,
2008. Significant amounts of cash and liquid securities are also available in
other Citigroup entities.        Consistent with the strategic reconfiguration
of Citi s balance sheet, the build-up of liquidity resources and the shift in
focus on increasing structural liabilities, Citigroup entered 2010 with much of
its required long-term debt funding already in place. As a consequence, it is
currently expected that the direct long-term funding requirements for Citigroup
and CFI in 2010 will be $15 billion, which is well below the $39 billion of
expected maturities. 

Banking Subsidiaries Constraints on Supplying
Funds    There are various
legal and regulatory limitations on the ability of Citigroup s subsidiary
depository institutions to pay dividends, extend credit or otherwise supply
funds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. In determining the declaration
of dividends, each depository institution must also consider its effect on
applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy
statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking
organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
Citigroup did not receive any dividends from its banking subsidiaries during
2009.        Some of Citigroup s non-bank subsidiaries have credit facilities with
Citigroup s subsidiary depository institutions, including Citibank, N.A.
Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with Section 23A
of the Federal Reserve Act. There are various legal restrictions on the extent
to which Citi s subsidiary depository institutions can lend or extend credit to
or engage in certain other transactions with Citigroup and certain of its
non-bank subsidiaries. In general, transactions must be on arm s-length terms
and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. See Note 20 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Management of Liquidity    Management of liquidity at Citigroup is the
responsibility of the Treasurer. Citigroup runs a centralized treasury model
where the overall balance sheet is managed by Citigroup Treasury through Global
Franchise Treasurers and Regional Treasurers.  Day-to-day liquidity and
funding are managed by treasurers at the country and business level and are
monitored by Corporate Treasury and independent risk management. 

             A uniform liquidity risk management policy exists for Citigroup, its
consolidated subsidiaries and managed affiliates. Under this policy, there is a
single set of standards for the measurement of liquidity risk in order to ensure
consistency across businesses, stability in methodologies, transparency of risk,
and establishment of appropriate risk appetite. 

49 

Liquidity management is overseen by the Board of Directors through its
Risk Management and Finance Committee and by senior management through
Citigroup s Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO). One of the
objectives of the Risk Management and Finance Committee of Citigroup s Board of
Directors as well as the FinALCO is to monitor and review overall liquidity
policies and practices as well as the liquidity and balance sheet positions of
Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries. Additionally, oversight of liquidity
is provided by Citigroup s Global Asset and Liability Committee. Asset and
Liability Committees are also established for each region, country and/or major
line of business. 

MONITORING LIQUIDITY 

Funding and Liquidity Plans    Each principal operating subsidiary and/or
country must prepare a Funding and Liquidity Plan for approval by the Treasurer
and independent risk management. For significant entities, as defined by balance
sheet size and the liquidity risk position, the Funding and Liquidity Plan is
prepared and approved on an annual basis. The Funding and Liquidity Plan
addresses strategic liquidity issues and establishes the parameters for
identifying, measuring, monitoring and limiting liquidity risk and sets forth
key assumptions for liquidity risk management. The Funding and Liquidity Plan
includes analysis of the balance sheet, as well as the economic and business
conditions impacting, or potentially impacting, the liquidity of the major
operating subsidiary and/or country. As part of the Funding and Liquidity Plan,
liquidity limits, liquidity ratios, market triggers, and assumptions for
periodic stress tests are established and approved. 

Risk Tolerance    Citigroup establishes its key risk tolerances
based on stress tests and a cash capital ratio (as described in  Liquidity
Ratios  below). This framework requires that entities be self-sufficient or net
providers of liquidity in their designated stress tests and have excess cash
capital. Aggregate self sufficiency targets have been established for the
banking subsidiaries, Citigroup, the parent holding company, and CGMHI as well
as for individual entities as part of their Funding and Liquidity Plans. In
addition, an important benchmark for the combined Citigroup, the parent
holding company, and CGMHI is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all
maturing obligations for a one-year period without access to the unsecured
wholesale markets.  

               Within this context, there are a
series of tools used to monitor Citigroup s liquidity position.  These
include liquidity gaps and associated limits, liquidity ratios, stress testing
and market triggers, as described below. 

Liquidity Gaps and Limits    Citigroup uses a monitoring tool that measures
potential funding gaps over various time horizons in a standard operating
environment. The gap for any given funding need represents the potential market
access required, or placements to the market (internal or external) over
designated tenors. Limits establish risk appetite for potential market access in
standard operating conditions and are monitored against the liquidity position
on a daily basis. Limits are established based on evaluation of available
contingent actions and liquidity vulnerabilities under designated stress
scenarios. While the contingent capacity places a cap on the limits, the limits
are also evaluated based on the structural liquidity of the balance sheet,
stability of liabilities, liquidity of assets, depth of markets, the experience
of management, size of the balance sheet, historical utilization, and an
evaluation of expected business and funding strategy. Limits are established
such that in stress scenarios, entities are self-funded or net providers of
liquidity. Thus, the risk tolerance for liquidity funding gaps is limited based
on the capacity to cover the position in a stressed environment. These limits
are the key daily risk-management tool for Citigroup, the parent holding
company, and its banking subsidiaries. 

Liquidity Ratios    A series of standard corporate-wide liquidity
ratios has been established to monitor the structural elements of Citigroup s
liquidity. One of the key structural liquidity measures is the cash capital
ratio. Cash capital is a broader measure of the ability to fund the structurally
illiquid portion of Citigroup s balance sheet than traditional measures such as
deposits to loans or core deposits to loans.  Cash capital measures the
amount of long-term funding ( 1 year) available to fund illiquid
assets.  Long-term funding includes core customer deposits, long-term debt
and equity. Illiquid assets include loans (net of liquidity adjustments),
illiquid securities, securities haircuts and other assets (i.e., goodwill,
intangibles, fixed assets, receivables, etc.).  Cash capital targets are
established for Citigroup, the parent holding company, CGMHI
and Citigroup s aggregate banking subsidiaries.  In addition, each
entity is required to calculate a cash capital ratio on a monthly basis.
Benchmarks must be established and approved for the cash capital ratio as part
of the entities  Funding and Liquidity plan.  At December 31, 2009, the
combined Citigroup, the parent holding company, and CGMHI, as well as the
aggregate banking subsidiaries had an excess of cash capital. In addition, as of
December 31, 2009 the combined Citigroup, the parent holding company, and CGMHI
maintained liquidity to meet all maturing obligations significantly in excess
of  a one-year period without access to the unsecured wholesale
markets. 

50 

Stress Testing    Simulated liquidity stress testing is
periodically performed for each major operating subsidiary and/or country.
Stress testing / scenario analyses are intended to quantify the likely impact of
an event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable
funding alternatives that can be utilized in a liquidity event. A variety of
firm-specific and market-related scenarios are used at the consolidated level
and in individual countries.   These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key
funding sources, credit ratings, contingent uses of funding, and political and
economic conditions in certain countries. The results of stress tests of
individual countries and operating subsidiaries are reviewed to ensure that each
individual major operating subsidiary or country is either self-funded or a net
provider of liquidity. In addition, a Contingency Funding Plan is prepared on a
periodic basis for Citigroup. The plan includes detailed policies, procedures,
roles and responsibilities, and the results of corporate stress tests. The
product of these stress tests is a series of alternatives that can be used by
the Treasurer in a liquidity
event.        As a result of the recent financial crisis, Citigroup increased the
frequency, duration, and severity of certain stress testing, particularly
related to the interconnection of idiosyncratic and systemic risk. Citigroup,
the parent holding company,  CGMHI and Citigroup s largest bank entities
perform their key stress tests at a minimum on a monthly basis. In addition, in
conformity with recommendations made by the Credit Risk Management Policy Group,
Citigroup calculates a stressed 30-day maximum cash outflow compared with its
liquidity resources for some of its key operating entities. This 30-day maximum
cash outflow is performed on a daily basis.  For other entities, stress
testing is performed at a minimum on a quarterly basis. 

Market Triggers    Market triggers are internal or external
market or economic factors that may imply a change to market liquidity or
Citigroup s access to the markets.  Citigroup market triggers are
monitored by the Treasurer and the head of risk architecture and are
presented to the FinALCO.        Appropriate market triggers are also
established and monitored for each major operating subsidiary and/or
country.  Local triggers are reviewed with the local country or business
Asset and Liability Committee and independent risk management. 

Credit Ratings        Citigroup s
ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, as well as the
cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits, is dependent
on its credit ratings. The table below indicates the current ratings for
Citigroup.  

               As a result of the Citigroup
guarantee, changes in ratings for Citigroup Funding Inc. are the same as those
of Citigroup noted above.

On February 9, 2010, S P
affirmed the counterparty credit and debt ratings of Citi. At the same time,
S P revised its outlook on Citi to negative from stable. This action was the
result of S P s view that there is increased uncertainty about the U.S.
government s willingness to provide extraordinary support to a number of
systematically important financial institutions. Outlooks from both Moody s and
Fitch remained stable.         Ratings downgrades by Fitch Ratings, Moody s Investors Service or
Standard   Poor s have had and could continue to have material impacts on
funding and liquidity, and could also have further explicit material impact on
liquidity due to collateral triggers and other cash requirements. Because of the
current credit ratings of Citigroup Inc., a one-notch downgrade of

its senior debt/long-term rating could impact Citigroup Inc. s commercial
paper/short-term rating. As of December 31, 2009, a one-notch downgrade of the
senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc., accompanied by a one-notch
downgrade of Citigroup Inc. s commercial paper/short-term rating, would result
in an approximate $4.2 billion funding requirement in the form of collateral and
cash obligations. Further, as of December 31, 2009, a one-notch downgrade of the
senior debt/long-term ratings of Citibank, N.A. would result in an approximate
$4.2 billion funding requirement in the form of collateral and cash obligations.
Because of the current credit ratings of Citibank, N.A., a one-notch downgrade
of its senior debt/long-term rating is unlikely to have any impact on its
commercial paper/short-term rating.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS 

Citigroup and its
subsidiaries are involved with several types of off-balance-sheet arrangements,
including special purpose entities (SPEs), primarily in connection with
securitization activities in    Regional Consumer Banking    and    Institutional Clients
Group   . Citigroup and its
subsidiaries use SPEs principally to obtain liquidity and favorable capital
treatment by securitizing certain of Citigroup s financial assets, assisting
clients in securitizing their financial assets and creating investment products
for clients. For further   information on Citi s
securitization activities and involvement in SPEs,  

see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and  Significant
Accounting Policies and Significant
Estimates Securitizations.    

               The following tables describe
certain characteristics of assets owned by certain identified significant
unconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) as of December 31, 2009. These

CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS 

The following table
includes aggregated information about Citigroup s contractual obligations that
impact its short- and long-term liquidity and capital needs. The table includes
information about payments due under specified contractual obligations,
aggregated by type of contractual obligation. It includes the maturity profile
of Citigroup s consolidated long-term debt, leases and other long-term
liabilities.        Citigroup s contractual obligations include
purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding for Citi. For the
purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are included through the
termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is
renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses
that would allow Citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified notice;
however, that impact is not included in the table (unless Citigroup has already
notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the
agreement).        Other liabilities reflected on Citigroup s
Consolidated Balance Sheet include obligations for goods and services that have
already been received, uncertain tax positions, as well as other long-term
liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in
cash.        Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally
short-term in nature, including deposit liabilities and securities sold under
  agreements to repurchase. The table also excludes certain
insurance and  

investment contracts
subject to mortality and morbidity risks or without defined maturities, such
that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities
related to these insurance and investment contracts are included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves,
Contractholder Funds, and Separate and Variable Accounts. 

               Citigroup s funding policy for pension plans is generally to fund to the
minimum amounts required by the applicable laws and regulations. At December 31,
2009, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are
currently planned for the U.S. pension plans. Accordingly, no amounts have been
included in the table below for future contributions to the U.S. pension plans.
For the non-U.S. pension plans, discretionary contributions in 2010 are
anticipated to be approximately $160 million. The anticipated cash contributions
in 2010 related to the non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans are $72
million. These amounts are included in the purchase obligations in the table
below. The estimated pension and postretirement plan contributions are subject
to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as
market performance, regulatory and legal requirements, and management s ability
to change funding policy. For additional information regarding Citi s retirement
benefit obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RISK FACTORS  

The economic recession and disruptions in
the global financial markets have adversely affected, and may continue to
adversely affect, Citigroup s business and results of
operations.      The financial services industry and the capital markets have been, and
may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the economic recession
and disruptions in the global financial markets. These market disruptions were
initially triggered by declines that impacted the value of subprime mortgages,
but spread to all mortgage and real estate asset classes, to leveraged bank
loans and to nearly all asset classes, including equities. These market
disruptions resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial
institutions, including Citigroup, causing many financial institutions to seek
additional capital, merge with other financial institutions or, in some cases,
go bankrupt.        Disruptions in the global financial markets
have also adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the
corporate bond markets, equity markets, debt and equity underwriting, and other
elements of the financial markets. Such disruptions have caused some lenders and
institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease to provide funding
to certain borrowers, including other financial institutions. Credit headwinds,
increasingly volatile financial markets and reduced levels of business activity
may continue to negatively impact Citigroup s business, capital, liquidity,
financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading price of
Citigroup common stock, preferred stock and debt
securities.        Moreover, market and economic disruptions have
affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels, consumer
spending, personal bankruptcy rates, and levels of incurrence and default on
consumer debt and home prices, among other factors, in certain of the markets in
which Citigroup operates. Any of these factors, along with persistently high
levels of unemployment, may result in a greater likelihood of reduced client
interaction or elevated delinquencies on consumer loans, particularly with
respect to Citi s credit card and mortgage programs, or other obligations to
Citigroup. This, in turn, could result in a higher level of loan losses and
Citi s allowances for credit losses, all of which could adversely affect
Citigroup s earnings. While Citigroup has instituted loss mitigation programs to
work with distressed borrowers and potentially mitigate these effects, these
programs are in the early stages, and it is uncertain whether they will be
successful.        In connection with significant government and
central bank actions taken in late 2008 and in 2009, the U.S. and global
economies began to see signs of stabilization in certain areas, and some early
positive economic signs were observed in late 2009. Despite these positive
signs, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the sustainability and
pace of economic recovery, unemployment levels, the impact of the U.S. and other
governments  unwinding of their extensive economic and market supports, which
may accelerate in 2010, and Citi s delinquency and credit loss
trends. 

Previously enacted and potential future
legislation, including legislation to reform the U.S. financial regulatory
system, could require Citigroup to change certain of its business practices,
impose additional costs on Citigroup or otherwise adversely affect its
businesses.      In addition to previously enacted governmental assistance programs
designed to stabilize and stimulate the U.S. economy (including without
limitation the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) and the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)), recent economic,
political and market conditions have led to numerous proposals in the U.S. for
changes in the regulation of the financial industry in an effort to prevent
future crises and to reform the financial regulatory
system.        Some of these proposals have already been adopted. For example, in May
2009, the U.S. Congress enacted the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility
and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act), which, among other things, restricts
certain credit card practices, requires expanded disclosures to consumers and
provides consumers with the right to opt out of certain interest rate increases.
Complying with these legislative changes, as well as the requirements of the
amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) adopted by the Federal Reserve
Board and effective July 2010, will require Citigroup to invest significant
management attention and resources to make the necessary disclosure and system
changes in its U.S. card businesses and will affect the results of such
businesses. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations    North America Regional Consumer Banking     above and  Managing Global Risk Credit
Risk 2010 Credit Outlook  and        North America    Cards  below for additional
information.        In addition, in 2009, the Obama Administration
released a comprehensive plan for regulatory reform in the financial industry.
The Administration s plan calls for significant proposed structural reforms and
new substantive regulation across the financial industry, including, without
limitation, requiring that broker-dealers who provide investment advice about
securities to investors have the same fiduciary obligations as registered
investment advisers; new requirements for the securitization market, including
requiring a securitizer to retain a material economic interest in the credit
risk associated with the underlying securitization; and additional regulation
with respect to the trading of over-the-counter derivatives. In addition, the
Administration s plan calls for increased scrutiny and regulation, including
potentially heightened capital requirements, for any financial institution whose
combination of size, leverage and interconnectedness could pose a threat to
market-wide financial stability if it failed. This is sometimes referred to as
 systemic risk  and may adversely affect Citigroup, as well as the financial
intermediaries with which it interacts on a daily basis such as clearing
agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges.

54  

The House Financial Services Committee began considering legislation
based on the Administration s proposal, and in December 2009, the U.S. House of
Representatives passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The
bill calls for comprehensive financial regulatory reform and would create a
Consumer Protection Agency whose mandate includes measures that would subject
federally chartered financial institutions to state consumer protection laws
that have historically been preempted. The bill would also provide Federal
regulators with the authority to rein in or dismantle financial institutions
whose collapse could pose a systemic risk to the financial stability or economy
of the U.S. due to their size, leverage or interconnectedness. The Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee also issued a discussion draft of a
bill in November 2009 based on the Administration s proposal, which differs
significantly from the House bill in many
respects.        More recently, in early 2010, the Obama
Administration proposed further restrictions on the size and scope of banks and
other financial institutions. There can be no assurance as to whether or when
any of the parts of the Administration s plan or other proposals will be enacted
into legislation and, if adopted, what the final provisions of such legislation
will be. New legislation and regulatory changes could require Citigroup to
further change certain of its business practices, impose additional costs on
Citigroup, some significant, adversely affect its ability to pursue business
opportunities it might otherwise consider engaging in, cause business
disruptions or impact the value of assets that Citigroup holds. 

Citigroup s participation in government
programs to modify first and second lien mortgage loans could adversely affect
the amount and timing of its earnings and credit losses relating to those
loans.      The U.S. Treasury has announced guidelines for its first and second lien
modification programs under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).
Citigroup began participating in the HAMP with respect to first mortgages during
the second quarter of 2009 and is actively engaged in discussions with the U.S.
Treasury for the second lien
program.        Participation in the HAMP could result in a
reduction in the principal balances of certain first and second lien mortgage
loans and the acceleration of loss recognition on those loans. In addition to
the principal reduction aspect of the programs, loan modification efforts can
impact the interest rate and term of these loans, which would in turn impact the
total return on those assets and the timing of those returns. Participation in
the programs as a servicer could also reduce servicing income to the extent the
principal balance of a serviced loan is reduced or because it increases the cost
of servicing a loan.         In order to participate in the HAMP, borrowers
must currently complete a three- to five-month trial period during which the
original terms of the loans remain in effect pending final modification. As a
result, Citigroup is uncertain of the overall impact the HAMP will have on its
delinquency trends, net credit losses and other loan loss
metrics. 

The expiration of a provision of the U.S.
tax law that allows Citigroup to defer U.S. taxes on certain active financial
services income could significantly increase Citi s tax
expense.      Citigroup s tax provision has historically been reduced because active
financing income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. is taxed at
the lower local tax rate rather than at the higher U.S. tax rate. Such reduction
has been dependent upon a provision of the U.S. tax law that defers the
imposition of U.S. taxes on certain active financial services income until that
income is repatriated to the U.S. as a dividend. This  active financing
exception  expired on December 31, 2009, and while it has been scheduled to
expire on five prior occasions and has been extended each time, there can be no
assurance that the exception will continue to be extended. The Obama
Administration s 2011 budget proposal includes a two-year extension of the
active financing exception. In addition, the U.S. House of Representatives has
passed a one-year extension of the exception that is now pending a vote in the
U.S. Senate. In the event this exception is not extended beyond 2009, the U.S.
tax imposed on Citi s active financing income earned outside the U.S. would
increase, which could further result in Citi s tax expense increasing
significantly.  

Citigroup s businesses are subject to risks
arising from extensive operations outside the United States. 
     As a global
participant in the financial services industry, Citigroup is subject to
extensive regulation, including fiscal and monetary policies, in jurisdictions
around the world.        As a result of the current financial crisis,
there are currently numerous reform efforts underway outside the U.S., including
without limitation proposals by the European Commission to amend bank capital
requirements and by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom to
enhance regulatory standards applicable to financial institutions. This level of
regulation could further increase in all jurisdictions in which Citigroup
conducts business. Any regulatory changes could lead to business disruptions or
could impact the value of assets that Citigroup holds or the scope or
profitability of its business activities. Such changes could also require
Citigroup to change certain of its business practices and could expose Citigroup
to additional costs, including compliance costs, and liabilities as well as
reputational harm. To the extent the regulations strictly control the activities
of financial services institutions, such changes would also make it more
difficult for Citigroup to distinguish itself from
competitors. 

55  

In addition, the emerging markets in which Citigroup operates or invests,
or in which it may do so in the future, particularly as a result of its overall
strategy, may be more volatile than the U.S. markets or other developed markets
outside the U.S. and are subject to changing political, economic, financial and
social factors. Among other factors, these include the possibility of recent or
future changes in political leadership and economic and fiscal policies and the
possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or
restrictions applicable to companies or investments in these countries.
Citigroup s inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular
market could have a materially adverse effect not only on its business in that
market but also on its reputation generally. 

Future issuances of Citigroup common stock
and preferred stock may reduce any earnings available to Citi s common
stockholders and the return on the company s
equity.      During 2009, Citigroup raised a total of approximately $79 billion in
private and public offerings of common stock in connection with its exchange
offers and as required by the U.S. government pursuant to Citigroup s repayment
of TARP. This amount does not include approximately $3.5 billion of tangible
equity units issued in December 2009 that will be settled for additional shares
of Citigroup common stock that may be issued over a three-year period but in no
event later than December 2012.        In addition, in January 2010, Citigroup issued
$1.7 billion of common stock equivalents to its employees in lieu of cash
compensation they would have otherwise received. Subject to shareholder approval
at Citi s annual shareholder meeting scheduled to be held on April 20, 2010,
such amount of common stock equivalents will be converted to common stock.
Further, pursuant to its agreement with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority
(ADIA), entered into in November 2007, Citi will issue an aggregate of $7.5
billion of common stock, at a price per share of $31.83, over an approximately
two-year period beginning in March
2010.        While this additional capital has provided, or will provide, funding to
Citigroup s businesses and has improved, or will improve, Citigroup s financial
position and capital strength, it has increased, or will increase, Citigroup s
equity and the number of actual and diluted shares of Citigroup common stock.
Such increases in the outstanding shares of common stock reduce Citigroup s
earnings per share and the return on Citigroup s equity, unless Citigroup s
earnings increase correspondingly. In addition, any additional future issuances
of common stock, including without limitation pursuant to U.S. governmental
requirements or programs, could further dilute the existing common stockholders
and any earnings available to the common stockholders. 

The sale by the U.S. Treasury of its stake
in Citigroup will result in a substantial amount of Citigroup common stock
entering the market, which could adversely affect the market price of Citigroup
common stock.      As of December 31, 2009, the U.S. Treasury held a 27.0% ownership stake
in Citigroup. In December 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced that it planned to
divest its stake during 2010, subject to market conditions and following a
90-day lockup period that will expire on March 16, 2010, resulting in
approximately 7.7 billion shares of Citigroup common stock being sold into the
market. The divestiture of such a large number of shares of Citigroup common
stock within the announced timeframe could adversely affect the market price of
Citigroup common stock. 

Citigroup s ability to utilize its deferred
tax assets (DTAs) to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited
if it experiences an  ownership change  under the Internal Revenue
Code.      As
of December 31, 2009, Citigroup had recognized net DTAs of approximately $46.1
billion, which are included in its tangible common equity. Citigroup s ability
to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited
if Citigroup experiences an  ownership change  as defined in Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership
change will occur if there is a cumulative change in Citigroup s ownership by
 5-percent shareholders  (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage
points over a rolling three-year
period.        The common stock issued pursuant to the exchange offers in July 2009, and
the common stock and tangible equity units issued in December 2009 as part of
Citigroup s TARP repayment, did not result in an ownership change under the
Code. However, these common stock issuances have materially increased the risk
that Citigroup will experience an ownership change in the
future.        On June 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Citigroup adopted a Tax
Benefits Preservation Plan. This Plan is subject to shareholders  approval at
the 2010 Annual Meeting. The purpose of the Plan is to minimize the likelihood
of an ownership change occurring for Section 382 purposes. Despite adoption of
the Plan, future transactions in Citigroup stock that may not be in its control
may cause Citigroup to experience an ownership change and thus limit its ability
to utilize its DTAs, as well as cause a reduction in Citigroup s tangible common
equity and stockholders  equity. 

Increases in FDIC insurance premiums and
other proposed fees on banks may adversely affect Citigroup s
earnings.      During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have
dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the deposit
insurance fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore
reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased, and may
further increase in the future, assessment rates of insured institutions. In
November 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring banks to prepay three years of
estimated premiums to replenish the depleted insurance fund, which Citigroup
paid in the fourth quarter of 2009. There have also been proposals to change the
basis on which these assessment rates are determined. Moreover, the Obama
Administration has recently suggested the imposition of other fees on banking
institutions.        Citigroup is generally unable to control
the basis or the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC
insurance or the levying of other fees or assessments on financial institutions.
If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, Citigroup may be
required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels.
These announced increases and prepayments, and any future increases or other
required fees, could adversely impact Citigroup s
earnings. 

56  

Citigroup s businesses may be materially
adversely affected if it is unable to hire and retain qualified
employees.      Citigroup s performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts
of the highly skilled individuals that Citigroup is able to attract and retain.
Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses
outside of the financial services industry for qualified employees has often
been intense.        Citigroup is required to comply with the U.S.
government s standards for executive compensation and related corporate
governance set forth in the ARRA generally for so long as the U.S. government
holds certain Citigroup securities. These standards generally apply to
Citigroup s senior-most executives and certain other highly compensated
employees. The incentive compensation arrangements for Citigroup s top 30 most
highly compensated employees are also subject to review under the incentive
compensation principles set by the Federal Reserve Board, in consultation with
Citi s other regulators. In addition, the U.K. recently imposed a one-time 50%
tax on bonuses above a certain amount paid to employees of banks operating in
the country.        Furthermore, the market price of Citigroup
common stock has declined significantly from a closing price of $55.12 on May
25, 2007. Because a substantial portion of Citigroup s annual bonus compensation
paid to its senior employees has been paid in the form of equity, such awards
may not be as valuable from a compensatory or retention
perspective.        There can be no assurance that, as a result of
these restrictions, or any potential future compensation restrictions or
guidelines imposed on Citigroup, Citigroup will be able to attract new employees
and retain and motivate its existing employees, which may in turn affect its
ability to compete effectively in its businesses, manage its businesses
effectively and expand into new businesses and geographic regions.  

Failure to maintain the value of the
Citigroup brand may adversely affect its
businesses.      Citigroup s success depends on the continued strength and recognition of
the Citigroup brand on a global basis. The Citi name is integral to its business
as well as to the implementation of its strategy for expanding its businesses,
including outside the U.S. Maintaining, promoting and positioning the Citigroup
brand will depend largely on the success of its ability to provide consistent,
high-quality financial services and products to its clients around the world.
Citigroup s brand could be adversely affected if it fails to achieve these
objectives or if its public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative
views about Citigroup or the financial services industry in general, or by a
negative perception of Citigroup s short-term or long-term financial prospects.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Citigroup s
businesses. 

Although Citigroup currently believes it is
 well capitalized,  its capitalization may not prove to be sufficiently
consistent with its risk profile or sufficiently robust relative to future
capital requirements.      Citigroup s capital management framework is
designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain
sufficient capital consistent with Citigroup s risk profile, all applicable
regulatory standards and guidelines as well as external rating agency
conditions. Citigroup is subject to the risk based capital guidelines issued by
the Federal Reserve Board. Capital adequacy is measured, in part, based on two
risk based capital ratios, the Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital
plus Tier 2 Capital) ratios. In conjunction with the conclusion of the
Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), U.S. banking regulators developed
a new measure of capital called Tier 1 Common. While Tier 1 Common and related
ratios are measures used and relied on by U.S. banking regulators, they are
non-GAAP financial measures for SEC purposes. See  Capital Resources and
Liquidity  above for additional information on these metrics. Citigroup is
also subject to a Leverage ratio requirement, a non-risk-based measure of
capital adequacy. For additional information on these capital adequacy metrics,
including the estimated impact to Citi s capital ratios of adopting SFAS 166 and
SFAS 167 as of January 1, 2010, see  Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital
Resources.         To be  well capitalized  under U.S. federal bank regulatory agency
definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least
6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10% and a Leverage ratio of at least 3%,
and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher
capital levels. As of December 31, 2009, Citigroup was  well capitalized,  with
a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.7%, a Total Capital ratio of 15.2% and a Leverage
ratio of 6.9%, as well as a Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.6%. There can be no
assurance, however, that Citigroup will be able to maintain sufficient capital
consistent with its risk profile or remain  well capitalized.  Moreover, the
various regulators in the U.S. and abroad have not reached consensus as to the
appropriate level of capitalization for financial services institutions such as
Citigroup. These regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, may alter the
current regulatory capital requirements to which Citigroup is subject and
thereby necessitate equity increases that could dilute existing stockholders,
lead to required asset sales or adversely impact the availability of Citi s
DTAs, as described above, among other
issues.        In addition, Citigroup could adopt the provisions of the Basel II
regulatory capital framework as early as April 1, 2011. This new regulatory
capital framework is likely to result in a need for Citigroup to hold additional
regulatory capital. If market conditions do not improve, the capital
requirements of Basel II could increase prior to scheduled implementation in
2011, further increasing the amount of capital needed by Citi. The new rules
could also result in changes in Citigroup s funding mix, resulting in lower net
income and/or continued shrinking of the balance sheet. Separate from the above
Basel II rules for credit and operational risk, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision has also proposed revisions to the market risk framework that could
also lead to additional capital requirements. Although not yet ratified by the
U.S. regulators, the Basel II rules for market risk are currently scheduled for
January 1, 2011, one quarter ahead of Citigroup s earliest date for Basel II
implementation for credit and operational risk.

Liquidity is essential to Citigroup s
businesses, and Citigroup relies on external sources to finance a significant
portion of its operations.      Adequate liquidity is essential to Citigroup s
businesses. Citigroup s liquidity could be materially, adversely affected by
factors Citigroup cannot control, such as general disruption of the financial
markets or negative views about the financial services industry in general. In
addition, Citigroup s ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders
develop a negative perception of Citigroup s short-term or long-term financial
prospects, or a perception that it is experiencing greater liquidity
risk.        Regulatory measures instituted in late 2008 and 2009, such as the FDIC s
temporary guarantee of the newly issued senior debt as well as deposits in
non-interest-bearing deposit transaction accounts, and the commercial paper
funding facility of the Federal Reserve Board were designed to stabilize the
financial markets and the liquidity position of financial institutions such as
Citigroup. While much of Citigroup s long-term and short-term unsecured funding
during 2009 was issued pursuant to these government-sponsored funding programs,
Citigroup began to access funding outside of these programs, particularly during
the fourth quarter of 2009, due, in part, to the fact that many of these
facilities were terminating. Citi s reliance on government-sponsored short-term
funding facilities was substantially reduced as of the end of 2009. The impact
that the termination of any of these facilities could have on Citigroup s
ability to access funding in the future is uncertain. It is also unclear whether
Citigroup will be able to regain access to the public long-term unsecured debt
markets on historically customary
terms.        Citigroup s cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly
related to its credit spreads in both the cash bond and derivatives markets.
Increases in Citigroup s credit qualifying spreads can significantly increase
the cost of this funding. Credit spreads are influenced by market and rating
agency perceptions of Citigroup s creditworthiness and may be influenced by
movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to
Citigroup s long-term debt.        In addition, a significant portion of
Citigroup s business activities are based on gathering deposits and borrowing
money and then lending or investing those funds, including through market-making
activities in tradable securities. Citigroup s profitability is in part a
function of the spread between interest rates earned on such loans and
investments, as well as other interest-earning assets, and the interest rates
paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. During 2009, the need
to maintain adequate liquidity caused Citigroup to invest available funds in
lower-yielding assets, such as those issued by the U.S. government. As a result,
during 2009, the yields across both the interest-earning assets and the
interest-bearing liabilities dropped significantly from 2008. The lower asset
yields more than offset the lower cost of funds, resulting in lower net interest
margins compared to 2008. There can be no assurance that Citigroup s net
interest margins will not continue to remain low. 

Any reduction in Citigroup s and its
subsidiaries  credit ratings could increase the cost of its funding from, and
restrict its access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect
on its results of operations and financial
condition.      Each of Citigroup s and Citibank, N.A. s long-term/senior debt is
currently rated investment grade by Fitch Ratings, Moody s Investors Service and
Standard   Poor s. The rating agencies regularly evaluate Citigroup and its
subsidiaries, and their ratings of Citigroup s and its subsidiaries  long-term
and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including financial
strength, as well as factors not entirely within the control of Citigroup and
its subsidiaries, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry
generally.        In light of the difficulties in the financial
services industry and the financial markets generally, or as a result of events
affecting Citigroup more specifically, Citigroup and its subsidiaries may not be
able to maintain their current respective ratings. A reduction in Citigroup s or
its subsidiaries  credit ratings could adversely affect Citigroup s liquidity,
widen its credit spreads or otherwise increase its borrowing costs, limit its
access to the capital markets or trigger obligations under certain bilateral
provisions in some of Citigroup s trading and collateralized financing
contracts. In addition, under these provisions, counterparties could be
permitted to terminate certain contracts with Citigroup or require it to post
additional collateral. Termination of Citigroup s trading and collateralized
financing contracts could cause Citigroup to sustain losses and impair its
liquidity by requiring Citigroup to find other sources of financing or to make
significant cash payments or securities transfers. For additional information on
the potential impact of a reduction in Citigroup s or its subsidiaries  credit
ratings, see  Capital Resources and
Liquidity.         Certain of the credit rating agencies have stated that the credit ratings
of Citi and other financial institutions have benefited from the implicit
support that the U.S. government and regulators have provided to the financial
industry through the financial crisis. The expectation that this support will be
reduced over time, unless offset by improvement in standalone credit profiles,
could have a negative impact on the credit ratings of financial institutions,
including Citi.  

Market disruptions may increase the risk of
customer or counterparty delinquency or
default.      Market and economic disruptions, as well as the policies of the Federal
Reserve Board or other government agencies or entities, can adversely affect
Citigroup s customers, obligors on securities or other instruments or other
counterparties, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay
their securities or loans or otherwise default on their contractual obligations
to Citigroup, some of which maybe significant. These customers, obligors or
counterparties could include individuals or corporate or governmental entities.
Moreover, Citigroup may incur significant credit risk exposure from holding
securities or other obligations or entering into swap or other derivative
contracts under which obligors or other counterparties have long-term
obligations to make payments to Citigroup. Market conditions over the last
several years, including credit deterioration, decreased liquidity and pricing
transparency along with increased market volatility, have negatively impacted
Citigroup s credit risk exposure. Although Citigroup regularly reviews its
credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are
difficult to detect or foresee. 

58  

Citigroup may fail to realize all of the
anticipated benefits of the realignment of its
businesses.      Effective in the second quarter of 2009, Citigroup realigned into two
primary business segments, Citicorp and Citi Holdings, for management and
reporting purposes. The realignment is part of Citigroup s strategy to focus on
its core businesses and reduce non-core assets in a disciplined and deliberate
manner. Citigroup believes this structure will allow it to enhance the
capabilities and performance of Citigroup s core assets, through Citicorp, as
well as realize value from its non-core assets, through Citi
Holdings.        Citigroup intends to exit the Citi Holdings
non-core businesses as quickly as practicable yet in an economically
rational manner through business divestitures, portfolio run-off and asset
sales. Citigroup has been making substantial progress divesting and exiting
businesses included within Citi Holdings, having completed more than 20
divestitures over the last two years, including the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
joint venture, Nikko Cordial Securities and Nikko Asset Management sales. Citi
Holdings  assets have been reduced from a peak level of approximately $898
billion in the first quarter of 2008 to approximately $547 billion at year-end
2009.        Despite these efforts, given the rapidly changing and uncertain financial
environment, there can be no assurance that the realignment of Citigroup s
businesses will achieve the company s desired objectives or benefits, including
simplifying the organization and permitting Citigroup to allocate capital to
fund its long-term strategic businesses comprising Citicorp, or that Citi will
be able to continue to make progress in divesting or exiting businesses within
Citi Holdings in an orderly and timely manner. 

Citigroup may experience further
write-downs of its financial instruments and other losses related to volatile
and illiquid market conditions.      Market volatility, illiquid market conditions
and disruptions in the credit markets have made it extremely difficult to value
certain of Citigroup s assets. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors then
prevailing, may result in significant changes in the values of these assets in
future periods. In addition, at the time of any sales of these assets, the price
Citigroup ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the
market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value.
Further, Citigroup s hedging strategies with respect to these assets may not be
effective. Any of these factors could require Citigroup to take further
write-downs in respect of these assets, which may negatively affect Citigroup s
results of operations and financial condition in future
periods.        Citigroup finances and acquires principal
positions in a number of real estate and real-estate-related products for its
own account, for investment vehicles managed by affiliates in which it also may
have a significant investment, for separate accounts managed by affiliates and
for major participants in the commercial and residential real estate markets,
and originates loans secured by commercial and residential properties. Citigroup
also securitizes and trades in a wide range of commercial and residential real
estate and real-estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and
commercial assets and products, including residential and commercial
mortgage-backed securities. These businesses have been, and may continue to be,
adversely affected by the downturn in the real estate sector.

Furthermore, in the past, Citigroup has provided financial support to
certain of its investment products and vehicles in difficult market conditions,
and Citigroup may decide to do so again in the future for contractual reasons
or, at its discretion, for reputational or business reasons, including through
equity investments or cash or capital
infusions.        Should unemployment rates continue to be high,
and if stresses in the real estate market continue to depress housing prices,
Citi could experience greater write-offs and also need to set aside larger loan
loss reserves for mortgage and credit card portfolios as well as other consumer
loans. 

The elimination of QSPEs from the guidance
in SFAS 140 and changes in FIN 46(R) will significantly impact, and may continue
to significantly impact, Citigroup s Consolidated Financial
Statements.      During 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166,    Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets   , which eliminates Qualifying Special Purpose
Entities (QSPEs) from the guidance in SFAS No. 140, and SFAS No. 167,
   Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.
46(R)   , which makes three
key changes to the consolidation model in FIN 46(R),  Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities . Such changes include: (i) former QSPEs will now
be included in the scope of SFAS No. 167; (ii) FIN 46(R) has been
amended to change the method of analyzing which party to a variable interest
entity (VIE) should consolidate the VIE to a qualitative determination of
 power  combined with potentially significant benefits or losses; and (iii)
the analysis of primary beneficiaries has to be re-evaluated whenever
circumstances change.        These standards became effective January 1,
2010, including for Citigroup, and they will have a significant impact, and may
have an ongoing significant impact, on Citigroup s Consolidated Financial
Statements as Citi will be required to bring a portion of assets that were not
historically on its balance sheet onto its balance sheet, which will also impact
Citi s capital ratios. For a further discussion of these changes, see
 Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates  and Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. See also  Capital Resources and
Liquidity Capital Resources.  

Citigroup s financial statements are based
in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected
losses in the future.      Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, Citigroup is required
to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements,
including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation
and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If
assumptions or estimates underlying Citigroup s financial statements are
incorrect, Citigroup may experience material losses. For additional information,
see  Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates.   

Changes in accounting standards can be
difficult to predict and can materially impact how Citigroup records and reports
its financial condition and results of
operations.      Citigroup s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it
records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. From time
to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that
govern the preparation of Citigroup s financial statements. These changes can be
hard  

59  

to anticipate and
implement and can materially impact how Citigroup records and reports its
financial condition and results of operations. For example, the FASB s current
financial instruments project could, among other things, significantly change
the way loan loss provisions are determined from an incurred loss model to an
expected loss model, and may also result in most financial instruments being
required to be reported at fair value. 

Citigroup may incur significant losses as a
result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies, and
concentration of risk increases the potential for such
losses.      Citigroup seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a risk
and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary
financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal
controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While Citigroup
employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation
techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application
may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome
in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Market
conditions over the last several years have involved unprecedented dislocations
and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage
risk.        These market movements can, and have, limited the effectiveness of
Citigroup s hedging strategies and have caused Citigroup to incur significant
losses, and they may do so again in the future. In addition, concentration of
risk increases the potential for significant losses in certain of Citigroup s
businesses. For example, Citigroup extends large commitments as part of its
credit origination activities. Citigroup s inability to reduce its credit risk
by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during
periods of market dislocation, could negatively affect its results of operations
due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, as well as the loss of
revenues associated with selling such securities or loans. Further, Citigroup
routinely executes a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the
financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks and
investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with
respect to this industry. 

The financial services industry faces
substantial legal liability and regulatory risks, and Citigroup may face damage
to its reputation and incur significant legal and regulatory
liability.      Citigroup faces significant legal and regulatory risks in its businesses,
and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in
litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain
high. Citigroup s experience has been that legal claims by shareholders,
regulators, customers and clients increase in a market downturn. In addition,
employment-related claims typically increase in periods when Citigroup has
reduced the total number of employees, such as during the prior two fiscal

years. There have also
been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by
employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and Citigroup runs
the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to
deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions Citigroup
takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all
cases.        For further information relating to Citigroup s legal and regulatory
risks, see  Legal Proceedings  and Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

A failure in Citigroup s operational
systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair its
liquidity, disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential
information, damage Citigroup s reputation and cause
losses.      Citigroup s businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and
monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which
are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies.
These transactions, as well as the information technology services Citigroup
provides to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as
legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of Citigroup s client base
and its geographical reach, developing and maintaining Citigroup s operational
systems and infrastructure is challenging. Citigroup s financial, account, data
processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate
properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially
beyond its control, such as a spike in transaction volume or unforeseen
catastrophic events, adversely affecting Citigroup s ability to process these
transactions or provide these
services.        Citigroup also faces the risk of operational
failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents,
exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries Citigroup uses to
facilitate its transactions, and as Citigroup s interconnectivity with its
clients grows, it increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with
respect to its clients  systems.        In addition, Citigroup s operations rely on
the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other
information in its computer systems and networks. Although Citigroup takes
protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant, its
computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized
access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could
have a security impact. Given the high volume of transactions at Citigroup,
certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and
rectified. If one or more of such events occurs, this could potentially
jeopardize Citigroup s, its clients , its counterparties  or third parties 
confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted
through, Citigroup s computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause
interruptions or malfunctions in Citigroup s, its clients , its counterparties 
or third parties  operations, which could result in significant losses or
reputational damage.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK  

RISK
MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW    Citigroup believes that effective risk management is of primary
importance to its success. Accordingly, Citigroup has a comprehensive risk
management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it
assumes in conducting its activities. These include credit, market (including
liquidity) and operational risks (including legal and reputational exposures).
Each of credit, market and operational risk is discussed in more detail
throughout this section.        Citigroup s risk management framework is
designed to balance corporate oversight with well-defined independent risk
management functions. Enhancements continued to be made to the risk management
framework throughout 2009 based on guiding principles established by Citi s
Chief Risk Officer:  

a common risk capital model to
  evaluate risks; 
             
            a defined risk appetite, aligned
  with business strategy; 
             
            accountability through a common
  framework to manage risks; 
             
            risk decisions based on
  transparent, accurate and rigorous analytics; 
             
            expertise, stature, authority and
  independence of risk managers; and 
             
            empowering risk managers to make
  decisions and escalate issues.   
         
               Significant focus has been placed on fostering a risk culture based on a
policy of  Taking Intelligent Risk with Shared Responsibility, Without Forsaking
Individual Accountability:  

Taking intelligent risk  means
  that Citi must carefully measure and aggregate risks, must appreciate
  potential downside risks, and must understand risk/return
  relationships. 
             
             Shared responsibility  means that
  risk and business management must actively partner to own risk controls and
  influence business outcomes. 
             
             Individual accountability  means
  that all individuals are ultimately responsible for identifying, understanding
  and managing risks.   
         
               The Chief Risk Officer, working closely with the Citi CEO and established
management committees, and with oversight from the Risk Management and Finance
Committee of the Board of Directors as well as the full Board of Directors, is
responsible for:  

establishing core standards for
  the management, measurement and reporting of risk; 
             
            identifying, assessing,
  communicating and monitoring risks on a company-wide basis; 
             
            engaging with senior management
  and on a frequent basis on material matters with respect to risk-taking
  activities in the businesses and related risk management processes; and 
             
            ensuring that the risk function
  has adequate independence, authority, expertise, staffing, technology and
  resources.   

The risk management organization is structured so as to facilitate the
management of risk across three dimensions: businesses, regions and critical
products. Each of the company s major business groups has a Business Chief Risk
Officer who is the focal point for risk decisions, such as setting risk limits
or approving transactions in the business. There are also Regional Chief Risk
Officers, accountable for the risks in their geographic areas, who are the
primary risk contacts for the regional business heads and local regulators. In
addition, the positions of Product Chief Risk Officers were created for those
areas of critical importance to Citigroup, such as real estate, structured
products and fundamental credit. The Product Chief Risk Officers are accountable
for the risks within their specialty and focus on problem areas across
businesses and regions. The Product Chief Risk Officers serve as a resource to
the Chief Risk Officer, as well as to the Business and Regional Chief Risk
Officers, to better enable the Business and Regional Chief Risk Officers to
focus on the day-to-day management of risks and responsiveness to business
flow.        In addition to revising the risk management organization to facilitate
the management of risk across these three dimensions, the risk organization also
includes the business management team to ensure that the risk organization has
the appropriate infrastructure, processes and management reporting. This team
includes: 

the risk capital group, which
  continues to enhance the risk capital model and ensure that it is consistent
  across all our business activities; 
             
            the risk architecture group, which
  ensures the company has integrated systems and common metrics, and thereby
  allows us to aggregate and stress-test exposures across the
  institution; 
             
            the infrastructure risk group,
  which focuses on improving our operational processes across businesses and
  regions; and 
             
            the office of the Chief
  Administrative Officer, which focuses on re-engineering, risk communications
  and relationships, including our critical regulatory relationships. 

61  

RISK AGGREGATION AND STRESS TESTING    While Citi s major risk areas are described
individually on the following pages, these risks also need to be reviewed and
managed in conjunction with one another and across the various
businesses.         The Chief Risk Officer, as noted above,
monitors and controls major risk exposures and concentrations across the
organization. This means aggregating risks, within and across businesses, as
well as subjecting those risks to alternative stress scenarios in order to
assess the potential economic impact they may have on
Citigroup.         Comprehensive stress tests are in place across
Citi for mark-to-market, available-for-sale, and accrual portfolios. These
firm-wide stress reports measure the potential impact to Citi and its component
businesses of very large changes in various types of key risk factors (e.g.,
interest rates, credit spreads), as well as the potential impact of a number of
historical and hypothetical forward-looking systemic stress
scenarios.         Supplementing the stress testing described
above, Risk Management, working with input from the businesses and finance,
provides enhanced periodic updates to senior management on significant potential
exposures across Citigroup arising from risk concentrations (e.g., residential
real estate), financial market participants (e.g., monoline insurers), and other
systemic issues (e.g., commercial paper markets). These risk assessments are
forward-looking exercises, intended to inform senior management about the
potential economic impacts to Citi that may occur, directly or indirectly, as a
result of hypothetical scenarios, based on judgmental analysis from independent
risk managers. Risk Management also reports to the Risk Management and Finance
Committee of the Board of Directors, as well as the full Board of Directors on
these matters.        The stress testing and risk assessment
exercises are a supplement to the standard limit-setting and risk-capital
exercises described below, as these processes incorporate events in the
marketplace and within Citi that impact the firm s outlook on the form,
magnitude, correlation and timing of identified risks that may arise. In
addition to enhancing awareness and understanding of potential exposures, the
results of these processes then serve as the starting point for developing risk
management and mitigation strategies.  

RISK CAPITAL    Risk capital is defined as the amount of
capital required to absorb potential unexpected economic losses resulting from
extremely severe events over a one-year time period: 

Economic losses  include losses
  that appear on the income statement   and fair value adjustments to the financial statements, as well as
  any   further declines in value
  not captured on the income statement. 
             
             Unexpected losses  are the
  difference between potential extremely severe   losses and Citigroup s expected (average)
  loss over a one-year time period. 
             
             Extremely severe  is defined as
  potential loss at a 99.97% confidence   level, based on the distribution of observed events and scenario
  analysis.   
         
               The drivers of  economic losses  are risks, which for Citi can be broadly
categorized as credit risk (including cross-border risk), market risk (including
liquidity) and operational risk (including legal and regulatory):  

Credit risk losses primarily
  result from a borrower s or counterparty s   inability to meet its obligations. 
             
            Market risk losses arise from
  fluctuations in the market value of trading   and non-trading positions, including the
  treatment changes in value   resulting from fluctuations in rates. 
             
            Operational risk losses result
  from inadequate or failed internal processes,   systems or human factors or from external
  events.   
         
               These
risks are measured and aggregated within businesses and across   Citigroup to facilitate the understanding of
our exposure to extreme downside events as described under  Risk Aggregation and
Stress Testing.         The risk
capital framework is reviewed and enhanced on a regular basis in light of market
developments and evolving
practices.        The following is a more detailed discussion of
the principal risks Citi assumes in conducting its activities: credit, market
and operational risk.  

62  

CREDIT RISK     Credit risk is the potential for financial
loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its
financial or contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup s
business activities, including:  

lending; 
             
            sales and trading; 
             
            derivatives; 
             
            securities transactions; 
             
            settlement; and 
             
            when Citigroup acts as an
  intermediary.   
            Loan and Credit
Overview     During
2009, Citigroup reduced its aggregate loan portfolio by $102.7 billion to $591.5
billion. In addition, Citi s total allowance for loan losses totaled $36.0
billion at December 31, 2009, a coverage ratio of 6.09% of total loans, up from
4.27% at December 31, 2008.         During 2009, Citigroup recorded a net build of
$8.0 billion to its credit reserves, which was $6.6 billion lower than the build
in 2008. The net build consisted of a net build of $7.6 billion for consumer
loans ($1.7 billion in  RCB  and $5.9
billion in  LCL ) and a net build of $0.4
billion for corporate loans (a build of $0.9 billion in  ICG  and a release of $0.5 billion in  SAP ).        Net credit losses of $30.7 billion
during 2009 increased $11.7 billion from year-ago levels. The increase consisted
of $7.6 billion for consumer loans ($1.3 billion in  RCB , $6.1 billion in  LCL  and $0.2 billion in  SAP ) and a net increase of $4.1 billion for
corporate loans ($0.2 billion decrease in  ICG  offset by a $4.3 billion increase in  SAP ).        Consumer non-accrual loans totaled $18.6
billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $12.6 billion at December 31, 2008.
The consumer loan 90 days past due delinquency rate was 4.82% at December 31,
2009, compared to 2.96% at December 31, 2008. The 90 days past due delinquencies
continue to rise for the first mortgage portfolio in the U.S., primarily due to
the lengthening of the foreclosure process by many states and the increasing
impact of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Loans in the HAMP
trial modification period are reported as delinquent if the original contractual
payments are not received on time (even if the reduced payments agreed to under
the program are made by the borrower) until the loan has completed the trial
period under the program (see  Consumer Loan Modification Programs  and  U.S.
Consumer Mortgage Lending  below). The 30 to 89 days past due delinquency rate
was 3.56% at December 31, 2009, compared to 3.51% at December 31, 2008.        Corporate non-accrual loans were
$13.5 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $9.7 billion at December 31,
2008. The increase from the prior year is mainly due to Citi s continued policy
of actively moving loans into non-accrual at earlier stages of anticipated
distress. Over two-thirds of the non-accrual corporate loans are current and
continue to make their contractual
payments.        For Citi s loan accounting policies, see Note
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2010 Credit
Outlook     Credit
costs will remain a significant driver of Citi s financial performance in 2010.
Certain regions, including    Asia    and
   Latin America   , are showing improvement in consumer credit
trends. This trend is expected to continue into 2010 as long as economic
recovery in these regions is sustained. In    North America   ,
however, credit trends will largely depend on the broader macroeconomic
environment, as well as the impact of industry factors such as CARD Act
implementation and the outcome of the HAMP, each as discussed in more detail.
Across    North America   , a modest increase in net credit losses is
expected in the first quarter of 2010, after which there may be some slight
improvement. However, the outcome for the second half of 2010 will largely
depend on the economy, and the success of Citi s ongoing loss mitigation
efforts. Changes to the Company s consumer loan loss reserve balances will
continue to reflect the losses embedded in the portfolio due to underlying
credit trends, as well as the impact of forbearance
programs.         Corporate credit is inherently difficult to
predict, and accordingly, the recognition of credit losses and changes in
reserves will be somewhat episodic.

Non-Accrual
Assets     The table
below summarizes Citigroup s view of non-accrual loans as of the periods
indicated. Non-accrual loans are loans in which the borrower has fallen behind
in interest payments or, for corporate loans, where Citi has determined that the
payment of interest or principal is doubtful, and which are therefore considered
impaired. Consistent with industry conventions, Citi generally accrues interest
on credit card loans until such loans are charged-off, which typically occurs at
180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures in
this section do not include credit card loans. As discussed under  Accounting
Policies  in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in situations
where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal and interest
owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a
reduction of principal and not as interest income. There is no industry-wide
definition of non-accrual assets, however, and as such, analysis against the
industry is not always comparable.        As discussed under  Loan and Credit Overview, 
Citigroup has been actively moving corporate loans into the non-accrual category
at earlier stages of anticipated distress. Corporate non-accrual loans may still
be current on interest payments, however, and as of December 31, 2009, over
two-thirds of the total portfolio of non-accrual corporate loans are current and
continue to make their contractual payments.

Consumer
Loan Modification Programs            Citigroup has instituted a variety of
modification programs to assist borrowers with financial difficulties. These
programs include modifying the original loan terms, reducing interest rates,
extending the remaining loan duration and/or waiving a portion of the remaining
principal balance. Citi s programs consist of the U.S. Treasury s Home
Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), as well as short-term forbearance and
long-term modification programs, each summarized
below.         HAMP   . The HAMP is
designed to reduce monthly mortgage payments to a 31% housing debt ratio by
lowering the interest rate, extending the term of the loan and forbearing
principal of certain eligible borrowers who have defaulted on their mortgages or
who are at risk of imminent default due to economic hardship. In order to be
entitled to loan modifications, borrowers must complete a three- to five-month
trial period, make the agreed payments and provide the required documentation.
Effective June 1, 2010, documentation must be provided prior to beginning the
trial period, whereas prior to that date, it was required to be provided before
the end of the trial period. This change generally means that Citi will
be able to verify income up front for potential HAMP participants before
they begin making lower monthly payments. We believe this change will limit the
number of borrowers who ultimately fall out from the trials and potentially
mitigate the impact of HAMP trial participants on early bucket delinquency
data.          During the trial period, Citi requires that
the original terms of the loans remain in effect pending completion of the
modification. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $7.1 billion of first
mortgages were enrolled in the HAMP trial period, while $300 million have
successfully completed the trial period. Upon completion of the trial period,
the terms of the loan are contractually modified, and it is accounted for as a
 troubled debt restructuring  (see  Long-Term Programs  below). For additional
information on HAMP, see  U.S. Consumer Lending Mortgage Lending 
below.           Short-term programs   . Citigroup has also instituted interest rate reduction programs
(primarily in the United States) to assist borrowers experiencing temporary
hardships. These programs include short-term (12 months or less) interest rate
reductions and deferrals of past due payments. The loan volume under these
short-term programs increased significantly during 2009, and loan loss reserves
for these loans have been enhanced, giving consideration to the higher risk
associated with those borrowers and reflecting the estimated future credit
losses for those loans. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses for such modified
loans.          The following table presents the amounts of
gross loans modified under short-term interest rate reduction programs in the
U.S. as of December 31, 2009: 

Long-term
programs   . Long-term
modification programs, or  troubled debt restructurings  (TDRs), occur when the
terms of a loan have been modified due to the borrowers  financial difficulties
and a long-term concession has been granted to the borrower. Substantially all
programs in place provide permanent interest rate reductions. Valuation
allowances for TDRs are determined by comparing estimated cash flows of the
loans discounted at the loans  original contractual interest rates to the
carrying value of the loans. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses for such
modified loans.          The following table presents the amounts of
gross loans related to these TDRs as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: 

Payment deferrals that do not continue to accrue interest primarily occur
in the U.S. residential mortgage business. Other payment deferrals continue to
accrue interest and are not deemed to offer concessions to the customer. Other
types of concessions are not material.        As discussed in more detail in  U.S.
Consumer Lending Mortgage Lending  and  U.S. Consumer Lending North America
Cards  below, the measurement of the success of Citi s loan modification
programs varies by program objectives, type of loan, geography, and other
factors. Citigroup uses a variety of metrics to evaluate success, including
re-default rates and balance reduction trends. These metrics may be compared
against the performance of similarly situated customers who did not receive
concessions.

U.S.
CONSUMER LENDING Mortgage Lending 

Overview     Citi s  North
America  consumer mortgage portfolio consists of both first lien and
second lien mortgages. As of December 31, 2009, the first lien mortgage
portfolio in  LCL  totaled approximately
$118 billion while the second lien mortgage portfolio in  LCL  was approximately $54 billion. Although
the majority of the mortgage portfolio is managed by  LCL  within Citi Holdings, there are $0.5
billion of first lien mortgages and $1.7 billion of second lien mortgages
reported in Citicorp. Additionally, as mentioned above, in the first quarter of
2010, approximately $34 billion of U.S. mortgages will be transferred from  LCL  within Citi Holdings to  NA RCB  within
Citicorp.        Citi s first lien mortgage portfolio includes
$9.0 billion of loans with Federal Housing Administration or Veterans
Administration guarantees. These portfolios consist of loans originated to
low-to-moderate-income borrowers with lower FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) scores
and generally have higher loan-to-value ratios (LTVs). These loans have high
delinquency rates but, given the guarantees, Citi has experienced negligible
credit losses on these loans. The first lien mortgage portfolio also includes
$1.8 billion of loans with LTVs above 80%, which have insurance through private
mortgage insurance (PMI) companies, and $3.5 billion of loans subject to
Long-Term Standby Commitments 1  with U.S. government
sponsored enterprises (GSE), for which Citi has limited exposure to credit
losses. 

              The
following charts detail the quarterly trends in delinquencies and net credit
losses for Citi s first and second  North
America  consumer mortgage
portfolios.         For first mortgages, both delinquencies and
net credit losses are impacted by the HAMP trial loans in the U.S. mortgage
portfolio. As set forth in the first chart, first mortgage delinquencies rates
continued to increase in 2009, exacerbated in part by the reduction in loan
balances. The continued increase in first mortgage delinquencies during the
third and fourth quarters of 2009 was primarily attributable to both the
growing backlog of foreclosures in process and HAMP
modifications.        The growing amount of foreclosures in process,
which is related to an industry-wide phenomenon resulting from foreclosure
moratoria and other efforts to prevent or forestall foreclosure, have specific
implications on the portfolio:  

It tends to inflate the amount of
  180+ day delinquencies in our mortgage   statistics. 
             
            It can result in increasing levels
  of consumer non-accrual loans, as we are   unable to take possession of the underlying
  assets and sell these properties   on a timely basis. 
             
            It may have a dampening effect on
  NIM as non-accrual assets build on   the Company s balance sheet.   

As discussed in  Consumer Loan Modification Programs    above,
Citigroup offers short-term and long-term real estate loan modification
programs. Citi monitors the performance of its real estate loan modification
programs by tracking credit loss rates by vintage. At 18 months after modifying
an account, in Citi s experience to date, we typically reduce credit loss rates
by approximately one-third compared to similar accounts that were not
modified.        Currently, Citi s
efforts are concentrated on the HAMP. Contractual modifications of loans that
successfully completed the HAMP trial period began in September 2009;
accordingly, this is the earliest HAMP vintage available for comparison. While
early indications of the performance of these HAMP modifications are
encouraging, Citi remains cautious and will continue to monitor the performance
of these HAMP and non-HAMP modification programs and their impact on reducing
Citi s credit losses.         As previously disclosed, loans in the HAMP
trial modification period that do not make their original contractual payment
are reported as delinquent, even if the reduced payments agreed to under the
program are made by the borrower. Further, HAMP trial modifications have the
effect of marginally reducing our net credit losses and increasing our required
loan loss reserves. Specifically, the HAMP impacted Citi s net credit losses in
the first mortgage portfolio during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 as
loans in the trial period are not charged off at 180 DPD as long as they have
made at least one payment. Citigroup has increased its loan loss provisions to
appropriately reserve for this
risk.         Citigroup believes that the success rate of
the HAMP will be a key factor influencing net credit losses from delinquent
first mortgage loans, at least during the first half of 2010, and the outcome of
the program will largely depend on the success rates of borrowers completing the
trial period and meeting the documentation
requirements.        By contrast, second mortgages continue to show
positive trends in both net credit losses and delinquencies, reflecting the
impact of portfolio re-positioning and loss mitigation. Citi continues to
actively manage this exposure by reducing the riskiest accounts, including by
tightening credit requirements through higher FICOs, lower LTVs,
and increased documentation and verifications. As discussed under  Risk
Factors,  Citigroup is actively engaged in discussions with the U.S. Treasury
for the second lien program under HAMP.

              A Long-Term
      Standby Commitment (LTSC) is a structured transaction in which Citi
      transfers the credit risk of certain eligible loans to an investor in
      exchange for a fee. These loans remain on balance sheet unless they reach
      a certain delinquency level (between 120 and 180 days), in which case the
      LTSC investor is required to buy the loan at
par.

Data appearing in the tables below
have been sourced from Citigroup s risk systems and, as such, may not reconcile
with disclosures elsewhere generally due to differences in methodology or
variations in the manner in which information is captured. Citi has noted such
variations in instances where it believes they could be material to reconcile
the information presented elsewhere.           Citi s credit risk policy is not to
offer option ARMs/negative amortizing mortgage products to its customers. As a
result, option ARMs/negative amortizing mortgages represent an insignificant
portion of total balances that were acquired only incidentally as part of prior
portfolio and business purchases.        A portion of loans in the U.S. mortgage
portfolio currently requires a payment to satisfy only the current accrued
interest for the payment period, or an interest-only payment. Our mortgage
portfolio includes approximately $28 billion of first and second lien home
equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still within their revolving period and
have not commenced amortization. The interest-only payment feature during the
revolving period is standard for the HELOC product across the industry. The
first mortgage portfolio contains approximately $33 billion of mostly adjustable
rate mortgages (ARMs) that are currently required to make an interest-only
payment. These loans will be required to make a fully amortizing payment upon
expiration of their interest-only payment period, and most will do so within a
few years of origination. Borrowers that are currently required to make an
interest-only payment cannot select a lower payment that would negatively
amortize the loan. First mortgage loans with this payment feature are primarily
to high-credit-quality borrowers that have on average significantly higher
refreshed FICO scores than other loans in the first mortgage
portfolio. 

Loan
balances      First mortgages   Loan
balances.    As a consequence
of the difficult economic environment and the decrease in housing prices, LTV
and FICO scores have deteriorated since origination as depicted in the table
below. On a refreshed basis, approximately 28% of first lien mortgages had a LTV
ratio above 100%, compared to approximately 0% at origination. Approximately 30%
of the first lien mortgages had FICO scores less than 620 on a refreshed basis,
compared to 15% at origination. One half of the first lien mortgages with
refreshed LTV ratios above 100% have refreshed FICO scores greater than 660; 90

the second lien loans with LTV ratios greater than 100% had refreshed FICO
scores greater than 660; 90+ DPD rates for this portion of the portfolio were

origination have a 90+DPD rate of 7.9%.        Loans with FICO scores of less than
620 exhibit significantly higher delinquencies than in any other FICO band.
Similarly, loans with LTVs greater than 100% have higher delinquencies than LTVs
of less than or equal to 100%.        The first mortgage delinquencies continued to
rise during 2009. Further breakout of the FICO below 620 segment indicates that
delinquencies in this segment, on a refreshed basis, are about three times
higher than in the overall first mortgage portfolio.

following tables detail Citi s first and second lien U.S. consumer mortgage
portfolio by origination channel, geographic distribution and origination
vintage.  

By origination
channel      Citi s
U.S. consumer mortgage portfolio has been originated from three main channels:
retail, broker and correspondent.  

Retail: loans originated through a
  direct relationship with the borrower. 
           
          Broker: loans originated through a
  mortgage broker, where Citi   underwrites the loan directly with the borrower. 
           
          Correspondent: loans originated
  and funded by a third party, where Citi   purchases the closed loans after the
  correspondent has funded the loan.   This channel includes loans acquired in large bulk purchases from
  other   mortgage originators
  primarily in 2006 and 2007. Such bulk purchases   were discontinued in 2007.   
       
          First Lien
Mortgages: December 31, 2009     As of December 31, 2009, approximately 55% of
the first lien mortgage portfolio was originated through third-party channels.
Given that loans originated through correspondents have exhibited higher 90+DPD
delinquency rates than retail originated mortgages, Citi terminated business
with a number of correspondent sellers in 2007 and 2008. During 2008, Citi also
severed relationships with a number of brokers, only maintaining those who have
produced strong, high-quality and profitable volume. Citi has also discontinued
purchasing loans held in portfolio from correspondents and significantly reduced
bulk purchases.

76  

Second Lien
Mortgages: December 31, 2009     For second lien mortgages, approximately 49%
of the loans were originated through third-party channels. As these mortgages
have demonstrated a higher incidence of delinquencies, Citi no longer originates
second mortgages through third-party channels.

By state     Approximately half of Citi s U.S. consumer mortgage portfolio is located
in five states: California, New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois. Those states
represent 50% of first lien mortgages and 54% of second lien
mortgages. 

               Florida
and Illinois have above-average 90+DPD delinquency rates. Florida has 55% of its
first lien mortgage portfolio with refreshed LTV 100%, compared to 28%
overall for first lien mortgages. Illinois has 35% of its loan portfolio with
refreshed LTV 100%. Texas, despite having 40% of its portfolio with
FICO 620, has a lower delinquency rate relative to the overall portfolio.
Texas has less than 0.5% of its loan portfolio with refreshed
LTV 100%.

By
vintage     For
Citigroup s combined U.S. consumer mortgage portfolio (first and second lien
mortgages), approximately half of the portfolio consists of 2006 and 2007
vintages, which demonstrate above-average delinquencies. In first mortgages,
approximately 43% of the portfolio is of 2006 and 2007 vintages, which have
90+DPD rates well above the overall portfolio rate. In second mortgages, 62% of
the portfolio is of 2006 and 2007 vintages, which again have higher
delinquencies compared to the overall portfolio rate.

North
America Cards     Citi s  North America  cards
portfolio consists of our Citi-branded and retail partner cards portfolios
located in Citicorp  Regional Consumer
Banking  and Citi Holdings    Local Consumer Lending , respectively. As of
December 31, 2009, the Citi-branded portfolio totaled approximately $83 billion
while the retail partner cards portfolio was approximately $58 billion, both
reported on a managed basis.        The following charts detail the quarterly
trends in delinquencies and net credit losses for Citigroup s  North America  Citi-branded and retail partner
cards portfolios.        In each of the two portfolios, Citi has been
actively eliminating riskier accounts and sales to mitigate losses. First, we
have removed high-risk customers from the portfolio by either reducing available
lines of credit or closing accounts. On a net basis, end of period open accounts
are down 11% in both Citi-branded and retail partner cards versus prior-year
levels. Second, Citi has improved the tools used to identify and manage exposure
in each of the portfolios by targeting unique customer
attributes.        In Citi s experience to date, these portfolios
have significantly different characteristics: 

Citi-branded cards tend to have a
  longer estimated account life, with   higher credit lines and balances reflecting the greater utility of a
  multi-  purpose credit
  card. 
             
            Retail partner cards tend to have
  a shorter account life, with smaller credit   lines and balances. The account portfolio,
  by nature, turns faster and the   loan balances reflect more recent vintages.   

As a result, loss mitigation efforts, such as stricter underwriting
standards for new accounts, decreasing higher-risk credit lines, closing
high-risk accounts and re-pricing, tend to affect the retail partner cards
portfolio faster than the branded portfolio. 

In addition to tightening credit standards, Citi also continues to pursue
other loss mitigation efforts, including improvements in collections
effectiveness and various forbearance programs. We believe forbearance
programs improve the longer-term quality of these accounts.  

                  Citigroup offers both short-term and
long-term modification programs to its credit card customers, primarily in the
U.S. The short-term U.S. programs provide interest rate reductions for up to 12
months, while the long-term programs provide interest rate reductions for up to
five years. In both types of U.S. programs, the annual percentage rate (APR) is
typically reduced to below 10%.          Citigroup monitors the performance of these
U.S. credit card short-term and long-term modification programs by tracking
cumulative loss rates by vintages (when customers enter a program) and comparing
that performance with that of similar accounts whose terms were not modified.
For example, for U.S. credit cards, in Citi s experience to date, at 24
months after modifying an account, Citi typically reduces credit losses by
approximately one-third compared to similar accounts that were not modified.
Citi has observed that this improved performance of modified loans relative to
those not modified is generally greatest during the first 12 months after
modification. Following that period, losses have tended to increase but
typically stabilize at levels which are still below those for similar loans that
were not modified, resulting in an improved cumulative loss performance. To
date, Citi has tended to see that this benefit is sustained over time across our
U.S. credit card
portfolios.         Recognizing the impact of various
forbearance programs, we are nevertheless seeing some early positive credit
trends in both Citi-branded and retail partner cards. While both portfolios
experienced an expected seasonal increase in 90+ day delinquencies in the fourth
quarter of 2009, which we currently expect could lead to a moderate increase in
net credit losses in the first quarter of 2010, earlier bucket delinquencies
(30   89 days
past due) improved on a dollar
basis.        Overall, however, Citi remains cautious and currently believes that net
credit losses in each of the cards portfolios will continue to remain at
elevated levels and will continue to be highly dependent on the external
environment and industry changes.

As set forth in the table below, approximately 73% of the Citi-branded
portfolio had FICO credit scores of at least 660 on a refreshed basis as of
December 31, 2009, while 63% of the retail partner cards portfolio had scores
above 660. 

Note: Based on
balances of $137 billion. Balances include interest and fees. Excludes Canada,
Puerto Rico, Installment and Classified portfolios. Excludes balances where FICO
was unavailable ($0.7 billion for Citi-branded, $2.1 billion for retail partners
cards). 

The table below provides delinquency statistics for loans 90+DPD for both
the Citi-branded and retail partners cards portfolios as of December 31, 2009.
Given the economic environment, customers have migrated down from higher FICO
score ranges, driven by their delinquencies with Citi and/or with other
creditors. As these customers roll through the delinquency buckets, they
materially damage their credit score and may ultimately go to charge-off. Loans
90+DPD are more likely to be associated with low refreshed FICO scores, both
because low scores are indicative of repayment risk and because their
delinquency has been reported by Citigroup to the credit bureaus. Loans with
FICO scores less than 620, which constitute 16% of the Citi-branded portfolio,
have a 90+DPD rate of 16.9%; in the retail partner cards portfolio, loans with
FICO scores less than 620 constitute 24% of the portfolio and have a 90+DPD rate
of 18.0%. 

Note: Based on
balances of $137 billion. Balances include interest and fees. Excludes Canada,
Puerto Rico, Installment and Classified portfolios. 

U.S. Installment and Other Revolving
Loans  

        In the table below,
Citi s U.S. Installment portfolio consists of consumer loans in the following
businesses: Consumer Finance, Retail Banking, Auto, Student Lending and Cards.
Other Revolving consists of consumer loans (Ready Credit and Checking Plus
products) in the Consumer Retail Banking business. Commercial-related loans are
not included. 

As of December 31, 2009, the U.S. Installment portfolio totaled
approximately $56 billion, while the U.S. Other Revolving portfolio was
approximately $1 billion. While substantially all of the U.S. Installment
portfolio is managed under  LCL  within
Citi Holdings, it does include $0.4 billion of Consumer Retail Banking loans
which are reported in Citicorp. The U.S. Other Revolving portfolio is managed
under Citicorp.        The U.S.
Installment portfolio includes $20 billion of Student Loans originated under the
Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) where losses are substantially
mitigated by federal guarantees. These loans generally have higher 90+DPD rates
compared to other installment loans, but due to the federal guarantees,
have lower net credit loss rates relative to other installment
loans.        Approximately 43% of the Installment portfolio had FICO credit scores
less than 620 on a refreshed basis. Approximately 30% of the Other Revolving
portfolio is composed of loans having FICO less than 620. 

Note: Based on
balances of $54 billion for Installment and $0.9 billion for Other Revolving.
Excludes Canada and Puerto Rico. Excludes balances where FICO was unavailable
($2.3 billion for Installment, $0.1 billion for Other Revolving). 

The table below provides delinquency statistics for loans 90+DPD for both
the Installment and Other Revolving portfolios. Loans 90+DPD are more likely to
be associated with low refreshed FICO scores both because low scores are
indicative of repayment risk and because their delinquency has been reported by
Citigroup to the credit bureaus. On a refreshed basis, loans with FICO scores of
less than 620 exhibit significantly higher delinquencies than in any other FICO
band and will drive the majority of the losses. 

Note: Based on
balances of $54 billion for Installment and $0.9 billion for Other Revolving.
Excludes Canada and Puerto Rico.

Interest
Rate Risk Associated with Consumer Mortgage Lending
Activity     Citigroup originates and funds mortgage loans. As with all other lending
activity, this exposes Citigroup to several risks, including credit, liquidity
and interest rate risks. To manage credit and liquidity risk, Citigroup sells
most of the mortgage loans it originates, but retains the servicing rights.
These sale transactions create an intangible asset referred to as mortgage
servicing rights (MSRs). The fair value of this asset is primarily affected by
changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Thus,
by retaining the servicing rights of sold mortgage loans, Citigroup is still
exposed to interest rate risk.        In managing this risk, Citigroup hedges a
significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate
derivative contracts, forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed
securities, and purchased securities classified as trading (primarily
mortgage-backed securities including principal-only
strips).        Since the change in the value of these hedging
instruments does not perfectly match the change in the value of the MSRs,
Citigroup is still exposed to what is commonly referred to as  basis risk. 
Citigroup manages this risk by reviewing the mix of the various hedging
instruments referred to above on a daily
basis.        Citigroup s MSRs totaled $6.530 billion and $5.657 billion at December
31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. For additional information on
Citi s MSRs, see Notes 19 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

As part of the mortgage lending activity, Citigroup commonly enters into
purchase commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specific interest
rates within a given period of time, generally up to 60 days after the rate has
been set. If the resulting loans from these commitments will be classified as
loans held-for-sale, Citigroup accounts for the commitments as derivatives.
Accordingly, the initial and subsequent changes in the fair value of these
commitments, which are driven by changes in mortgage interest rates, are
recognized in current earnings after taking into consideration the likelihood
that the commitment will be
funded.        Citigroup hedges its exposure to the change in the value of these
commitments by utilizing hedging instruments similar to those referred to
above.

CORPORATE LOAN
DETAILS     For
corporate clients and investment banking activities across Citigroup, the credit
process is grounded in a series of fundamental policies, in addition to those
described under  Managing Global Risk Risk Management Overview,  above. These
include: 

joint business and independent
  risk management responsibility for   managing credit risks; 
             
            a single center of control for
  each credit relationship that coordinates   credit activities with that client; 

portfolio limits to ensure
  diversification and maintain risk/capital   alignment; 
             
            a minimum of two authorized credit
  officer signatures required on   extensions of credit, one of which must be from a credit officer in
  credit   risk management; 
             
            risk rating standards, applicable
  to every obligor and facility; and 
             
            consistent standards for credit
  origination documentation and remedial   management.   

Corporate
Credit Portfolio   The following table
presents credit data for Citigroup s corporate loans and unfunded lending
commitments at December 31, 2009. The ratings scale is based on Citi s internal
risk ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as defined by S P
and Moody s.  

(1)  
                       
              Includes
      $955 million of TDRs for which concessions, such as the reduction of
      interest rates or the deferral of interest or principal payments, have
      been granted as a result of deterioration in the borrowers  financial
      condition. Each of the borrowers is current under the restructured
      terms.  
            
              (2)  

Recorded investment in a loan
      includes accrued interest, net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized
      premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.  
            
              (3)  

Percentages disclosed above exclude
      Private Banking loans managed on a delinquency basis and loans at fair
      value.

      the  Special Mention,   Substandard  and  Doubtful  asset categories
      defined by banking regulatory
authorities.

The following tables represent the corporate credit portfolio (excluding
Private Banking), before consideration of collateral, by maturity at December
31, 2009. The corporate portfolio is broken out by direct outstandings that
include drawn loans, overdrafts, interbank placements, bankers  acceptances,
certain investment securities and leases and unfunded commitments that include
unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial
guarantees. 

Portfolio
Mix     The
corporate credit portfolio is diverse across counterparty and industry, and
geography. The following table shows direct outstandings and unfunded
commitments by region: 

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the
corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across
all lines of business, geographic regions and
products.        Obligor risk ratings reflect an estimated
probability of default for an obligor and are derived primarily through the use
of statistical models (which are validated periodically), external rating
agencies (under defined circumstances) or approved scoring methodologies.
Facility risk ratings are assigned, using the obligor risk rating, and then
factors that affect the loss-given default of the facility, such as support or
collateral, are taken into account.With regard to climate change risk, factors
evaluated include consideration of the business impact, impact of regulatory
requirements, or lack thereof, and impact of physical effects on obligors and
their assets. 

These factors may adversely affect the ability of
some obligors to perform and thus increase the risk of lending activities to
these obligors. Citigroup also has incorporated climate risk assessment criteria
for certain obligors, as necessary. 

             Internal obligor ratings equivalent to BBB and above are considered
investment grade. Ratings below the equivalent of the BBB category are
considered non-investment grade.        The following table presents the corporate
credit portfolio by facility risk rating at December 31, 2009 and 2008, as a
percentage of the total portfolio: 

The corporate credit portfolio is diversified by industry, with a
concentration only in the financial sector, including banks, other financial
institutions, insurance companies, investment banks and government and central
banks. The following table shows the allocation of direct outstandings and
unfunded commitments to industries as a percentage of the total corporate
portfolio: 

(1)  
                       
              Includes all other industries, none of which exceeds 2% of total
      outstandings.  

83  

Credit Risk
Mitigation     As
part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit
derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its
portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. The purpose of these
transactions is to transfer credit risk to third parties. The results of the
mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are
reflected in the    Principal transactions    line on the Consolidated Statement of
Income.        At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $59.6 billion and $95.5 billion,
respectively, of credit risk exposure were economically hedged. Citigroup s
expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not
include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other risk mitigants. In
addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded commitments
in this report do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the credit protection was economically hedging
underlying credit exposure with the following risk rating distribution,
respectively: 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the credit protection was economically

              (6)  
              This $8.4 billion in net direct exposures includes the $7.3 billion
      of assets reflected in the table titled  Assets Within Special Asset Pool

              (7)  
              Adjustment related to counterparty credit
risk.  

Citi Holdings had approximately $8.4 billion in net U.S. subprime-related
direct exposures in the  SAP  at December
31, 2009. The exposure consisted of (a) approximately $7.4 billion of net
exposures in the super-senior tranches (i.e., the most senior tranches) of CDOs,
which are collateralized by asset-backed securities, derivatives on asset-backed
securities, or both (ABS CDOs), and (b) approximately $1.0 billion of exposures
in its lending and structuring
business.        The    SAP    also has
trading positions, both long and short, in U.S. subprime RMBS and related
products, including ABS CDOs, which are not included in the figures above. The
exposure from these positions is actively managed and hedged, although the
effectiveness of the hedging products used may vary with material changes in
market conditions.  

Direct ABS CDO
super-senior exposures     The net $7.4 billion in ABS CDO super-senior exposures as of December 31,
2009 is collateralized primarily by subprime RMBS, derivatives on RMBS, or
both.        Citi Holdings  CDO super-senior subprime direct exposures are Level 3
assets. The valuation of the high-grade and mezzanine ABS CDO positions uses
trader prices based on the underlying assets of each high-grade and mezzanine
ABS CDO. Unlike the ABCP positions, the high-grade and 

mezzanine positions are
now largely hedged through the ABX and bond short positions, which are trader
priced. This results in closer symmetry in the way these long and short
positions are valued by the business. Citi Holdings intends to use trader marks
to value this portion of the portfolio going forward so long as it remains
largely hedged.        The valuation of the ABCP positions is subject
to valuation based on significant unobservable inputs. Fair value of these
exposures is based on estimates of future cash flows from the mortgage loans
underlying the assets of the ABS CDOs. To determine the performance of the
underlying mortgage loan portfolios, Citi estimates the prepayments, defaults
and loss severities based on a number of macroeconomic factors. The model is
calibrated using available mortgage loan information including historical loan
performance. An appropriate discount rate is then applied to the cash flows
generated for each ABCP tranche, in order to estimate its fair value under
current market conditions.        The valuation as of December 31, 2009 assumes
that U.S. housing prices are unchanged in 2010, increase 1.1% in 2011, increase
1.4% in 2012, and increase 3% from 2013 onwards. The U.S. unemployment rate is
assumed to peak at 10.3% during the first half of 2010. 

85  

The primary drivers that currently impact the model valuations are the
discount rates used to calculate the present value of projected cash flows and
projected mortgage loan performance. Each 10-basis-point change in the discount
rate used generally results in an approximate $24 million change in the fair
value of Citi s direct ABCP exposures as of December 31,
2009.        Estimates of the fair value of the CDO super-senior exposures depend on
market conditions and are subject to further change over time. For a further
discussion of the valuation methodology and assumptions used to value direct ABS
CDO super-senior exposures to U.S. subprime mortgages, see Note 26 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Lending and
structuring exposures     The $1.0 billion of subprime-related exposures includes approximately
$0.6 billion of actively managed subprime loans purchased for resale or
securitization at a discount to par during 2007 that continue to be held by
 SAP  and approximately $0.4 billion of
financing transactions with customers secured by subprime collateral, and are
carried at fair value.  

Exposure to
Commercial Real Estate in ICG and SAP      ICG    and the
   SAP   , through their business activities and as
capital markets participants, incur exposures that are directly or indirectly
tied to the commercial real estate (CRE) market. These exposures are represented
primarily by the following three categories: 

               (1)    Assets held at fair value    include approximately $5.5 billion, of which approximately $4.6 billion
are securities, loans and other items linked to CRE that are carried at fair
value as trading account assets, and of which approximately $0.9 billion are
securities backed by CRE carried at fair value as available-for-sale (AFS)
investments. Changes in fair value for these trading account assets are reported
in current earnings, while AFS investments are reported in    Accumulated other comprehensive income    with other-than-temporary impairments
reported in current earnings. 

The majority of these exposures are classified as Level 3 in the fair
value hierarchy. Weakening activity in the trading markets for some of these
instruments resulted in reduced liquidity, thereby decreasing the observable
inputs for such valuations, and could have an adverse impact on how these
instruments are valued in the future if such conditions
persist.        (2)    Assets held at amortized cost    include approximately $1.8 billion of
securities classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and $20.9 billion of loans and
commitments. The HTM securities were classified as such during the fourth
quarter of 2008 and were previously classified as either trading or AFS. They
are accounted for at amortized cost, subject to other-than-temporary impairment.
Loans and commitments are recorded at amortized cost, less loan loss reserves.
The impact from changes in credit is reflected in the calculation of the
allowance for loan losses and in net credit
losses.        (3)    Equity and other
investments    include
approximately $4.3 billion of equity and other investments such as limited
partner fund investments that are accounted for under the equity method, which
recognizes gains or losses based on the investor s share of the net income of
the investee. 

86  

Direct
Exposure to Monolines     Citi Holdings has exposure, via the    SAP   , to various
monoline bond insurers (Monolines), listed in the table below, from hedges on
certain investments and from trading positions. The hedges are composed of
credit default swaps and other hedge instruments. Citi Holdings recorded $1.3
billion 

in downward credit
valuation adjustments (CVA) related to exposure to Monolines during 2009,
bringing the total CVA balance to $5.6 billion. 

             The following table summarizes the market value of Citi Holdings  direct
exposures to and the corresponding notional amounts of transactions with the
various Monolines, as well as the aggregate credit valuation adjustment
associated with these exposures as of December 31, 2009 and
2008. 

The fair value exposure, net of payable and receivable positions,
represents the market value of the contract as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, excluding the CVA. The notional amount of the transactions,
including both long and short positions, is used as a reference value to
calculate payments. The CVA is a downward adjustment to the fair value exposure
to a counterparty to reflect the counterparty s creditworthiness in respect of
the obligations in question.        Credit valuation adjustments are based on
credit spreads and on estimates of the terms and timing of the payment
obligations of the Monolines. Timing in turn depends on estimates of the
performance of the transactions to which Citi s exposure relates, estimates of
whether and when liquidation of such transactions may occur and other factors,
each considered in the context of the terms of the Monolines 
obligations.        As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,  SAP  had $5.9 billion and $6.9 billion,
respectively, in notional amount of hedges against its direct subprime ABS CDO
super-senior positions. Of those amounts, $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion,
respectively, were purchased from Monolines and are included in the
notional amount of transactions in the table
above.        With respect to  SAP  s trading
assets, there were $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion of fair value exposure to
Monolines as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Trading assets include
trading positions, both long and short, in U.S. subprime RMBS and related
products, including ABS CDOs.        The notional amount of transactions related to
the remaining non-subprime trading assets as of December 31, 2009 was $5.4
billion. Of the $5.4 billion, $4.7 billion was in the form of credit default
swaps and total return swaps with a fair value exposure of $2.1 billion. The
remaining notional amount comprised $0.7 billion, primarily in interest-rate
swaps, with a corresponding fair value exposure of $12 million net
payable. 

The notional amount of transactions related to the remaining non-subprime
trading assets at December 31, 2008 was $6.9 billion, with a corresponding fair
value exposure of $2.3 billion. Of the $6.9 billion, $5.1 billion was in the
form of credit default swaps and total return swaps with a fair value of $2.3
billion. The remaining notional amount comprised $1.8 billion, primarily in
interest-rate swaps with a corresponding fair value exposure of $3.9
million.        Citigroup has purchased mortgage insurance
from various Monoline mortgage insurers on first-mortgage loans. The notional
amount of this insurance protection was approximately $230 million and $400
million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, with nominal pending
claims against this notional
amount.        In addition, Citigroup has indirect exposure to Monolines in various
other parts of its businesses. Indirect exposure includes circumstances in which
Citigroup is not a contractual counterparty to the Monolines, but instead owns
securities that may benefit from embedded credit enhancements provided by a
Monoline. For example, corporate or municipal bonds in the trading business may
be insured by the Monolines. The table and discussion above do not reflect this
type of indirect exposure to the Monolines.

Highly
Leveraged Financing Transactions     Highly leveraged financing commitments are
agreements that provide funding to a borrower with higher levels of debt
(measured by the ratio of debt capital to equity capital of the borrower) than
is generally the case for other companies. In recent years through mid-2008,
highly leveraged financing had been commonly employed in corporate acquisitions,
management buy-outs and similar
transactions.        In these financings, debt service (that is,
principal and interest payments) absorbs a significant portion of the cash flows
generated by the borrower s business. Consequently, the risk that the borrower
may not be able to meet its debt obligations is greater. Due to this risk, the
interest rates and fees charged for this type of financing are generally higher
than for other types of financing.        Prior to funding, highly leveraged financing
commitments are assessed for impairment and losses are recorded when they are
probable and reasonably estimable. For the portion of loan commitments that
relates to loans that will be held for investment, loss estimates are made based
on the borrower s ability to repay the facility according to its contractual
terms. For the portion of loan commitments that relates to loans that will be
held-for-sale, loss estimates are made in reference to current conditions in the
resale market (both interest rate risk and credit risk are considered in the
estimate). Loan origination, commitment, underwriting and other fees are netted
against any recorded losses.        Citigroup generally manages the risk
associated with highly leveraged financings it has entered into by seeking to
sell a majority of its exposures to the market prior to or shortly after
funding. In certain cases, all or a portion of a highly leveraged financing to
be retained is hedged with credit derivatives or other hedging instruments.
Thus, when a highly leveraged financing is funded, Citigroup records the
resulting loan as follows: 

the portion that Citigroup will
  seek to sell is recorded as a loan held-for-  sale in    Other assets    on
  the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and measured at   the lower of cost or market; and 
             
            the portion that will be retained
  is recorded as a loan held-for-investment   in    Loans    and
  measured at amortized cost less a reserve for loan losses. 

Due to the dislocation of the credit markets and the reduced market
interest in higher-risk/higher-yield instruments since the latter half of 2007,
liquidity in the market for highly leveraged financings has been limited. This
has resulted in Citi s recording pretax write-downs on funded and unfunded
highly leveraged finance exposures of $521 million in 2009 and $4.9 billion in
2008. 

Citigroup s exposures to highly leveraged financing commitments totaled
$5.0 billion at December 31, 2009 ($4.7 billion funded and $0.3 billion in
unfunded commitments), reflecting a decrease of $5 billion from December 31,
2008.        In 2008, Citigroup completed the transfer of approximately $12.0 billion
of loans to third parties, of which $8.5 billion relates to highly leveraged
loan commitments. In these transactions, the third parties purchased subordinate
interests backed by the transferred loans. These subordinate interests absorb
first loss on the transferred loans and provide the third parties with control
of the loans. Citigroup retained senior debt securities backed by the
transferred loans. These transactions were accounted for as sales of the
transferred loans. The loans were removed from the balance sheet and the
retained securities are classified as AFS securities on Citi s Consolidated
Balance Sheet.        In addition, Citigroup purchased protection on
the senior debt securities from the third-party subordinate interest holders via
total return swaps (TRS). The counterparty credit risk in the TRS is protected
through margin agreements that provide for both initial margin and additional
margin at specified triggers. Due to the initial cash margin received, the
existing margin requirements on the TRS, and the substantive subordinate
investments made by third parties, Citi believes that the transactions largely
mitigate Citi s risk related to the transferred
loans.        Citigroup s sole remaining exposure to the transferred loans are the
senior debt securities, which have an amortized cost basis and fair value of
$7.0 billion at December 31, 2009. The change in the value of the retained
senior debt securities that are classified as AFS securities are recorded in
AOCI as they are deemed temporary. The offsetting change in the TRS are recorded
as cash flow hedges within AOCI. See Notes 16 and 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

MARKET RISK  

        Market risk encompasses
liquidity risk and price risk, both of which arise in the normal course of
business of a global financial intermediary. Liquidity risk is the risk that an
entity may be unable to meet a financial commitment to a customer, creditor, or
investor when due. See  Capital Resources and Liquidity  for further
discussion.        Price risk is the earnings risk from changes
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices, and
in their implied volatilities. Price risk arises in non-trading portfolios, as
well as in trading portfolios.        Market risks are measured in accordance with
established standards to ensure consistency across businesses and the ability to
aggregate risk. Each business is required to establish, with approval from
independent market risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified
risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the
parameters of Citigroup s overall risk appetite. In all cases, the businesses
are ultimately responsible for the market risks they take and for remaining
within their defined limits.  

Non-Trading
Portfolios Interest Rate Risk     One of Citigroup s primary business functions
is providing financial products that meet the needs of its customers. Loans and
deposits are tailored to the customers  requirements with regard to tenor, index
(if applicable), and rate type. Net interest revenue (NIR) is the difference
between the yield earned on the non-trading portfolio assets (including customer
loans) and the rate paid on the liabilities (including customer deposits or
company borrowings). NIR is affected by changes in the level of interest rates.
For example: 

At any given time, there may be an
  unequal amount of assets and   liabilities that are subject to market rates due to maturation or
  repricing.   Whenever the amount
  of liabilities subject to repricing exceeds the   amount of assets subject to repricing, a
  company is considered  liability   sensitive.  In this case, a company s NIR will deteriorate in a
  rising   rate
  environment.  
             
            The assets and liabilities of a
  company may reprice at different speeds or   mature at different times, subjecting both
   liability-sensitive  and  asset-  sensitive  companies to NIR sensitivity from changing interest rates.
  For   example, a company may have
  a large amount of loans that are subject   to repricing in the current period, but the
  majority of deposits are not   scheduled for repricing until the following period. That company
  would   suffer from NIR
  deterioration if interest rates were to fall.   

NIR in the current period is the result of customer transactions and the
related contractual rates originated in prior periods as well as new
transactions in the current period; those prior-period transactions will be
impacted by changes in rates on floating-rate assets and liabilities in the
current period.        Due to the long-term nature of portfolios, NIR
will vary from quarter to quarter even assuming no change in the shape or level
of the yield curve as assets and liabilities reprice. These repricings are a
function of implied forward interest rates, which represent the overall market s
estimate of future interest rates and incorporate possible changes in the
Federal Funds rate as well as the shape of the yield curve. 

Interest
Rate Risk Governance     The risks in Citigroup s non-traded portfolios are estimated using a
common set of standards that define, measure, limit and report the market risk.
Each business is required to establish, with approval from independent market
risk management, a market risk limit framework that clearly defines approved
risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citigroup s overall risk appetite.
In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks
they take and for remaining within their defined limits. These limits are
monitored by independent market risk, country and business Asset and Liability
Committees (ALCOs) and the Global Finance and Asset and Liability Committee
(FinALCO).  

Interest
Rate Risk Measurement     Citigroup s principal measure of risk to NIR is interest rate exposure
(IRE). IRE measures the change in expected NIR in each currency resulting solely
from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. Factors such as changes in
volumes, spreads, margins and the impact of prior-period pricing decisions are
not captured by IRE. IRE assumes that businesses make no additional changes in
pricing or balances in response to the unanticipated rate
changes.        IRE tests the impact on NIR resulting from
unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. For example, if the current
90-day LIBOR rate is 3% and the one-year-forward rate is 5% (i.e., the estimated
90-day LIBOR rate in one year), the +100 bps IRE scenario measures the impact on
the company s NIR of a 100 bps instantaneous change in the 90-day LIBOR to 6% in
one year.        The impact of changing prepayment rates on
loan portfolios is incorporated into the results. For example, in the declining
interest rate scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios prepay faster
and income is reduced. In addition, in a rising interest rate scenario, portions
of the deposit portfolio are assumed to experience rate increases that may be
less than the change in market interest rates.  

Mitigation
and Hedging of Risk     Financial institutions  financial performance is subject to some
degree of risk due to changes in interest rates. In order to manage these risks
effectively, Citigroup may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits,
enter into transactions with other institutions or enter into off-balance-sheet
derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures. Therefore,
Citigroup regularly assesses the viability of strategies to reduce unacceptable
risks to earnings and implements such strategies when it believes those actions
are prudent. As information becomes available, Citigroup formulates strategies
aimed at protecting earnings from the potential negative effects of changes in
interest rates.        Citigroup employs additional measurements,
including stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the
value of the balance sheet; the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility,
particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities;
and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market
indices.

Non-Trading
Portfolios     The
exposures in the following table represent the approximate annualized risk to
NIR assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps change, as well as
a more gradual 100 bps (25 bps per quarter) parallel change in rates compared
with the market forward interest rates in selected currencies.  

NM  
                       
              Not meaningful. A 100 bps decrease in interest rates would imply
      negative rates for the Japanese yen yield
curve.  
             
             Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted
positions that are hedged with mark-to-market positions. If the economic impact
of these offsetting positions is included, Citi s 12-month exposure to a 100 bps
instantaneous rise in interest rates is reduced from $(1,194) million to $(731)
million. The changes in the U.S. dollar IRE from the prior year reflect changes
in the customer-related asset and liability mix, the expected impact of market
rates on customer behavior and Citigroup s view of prevailing interest
rates. 

The following table shows the risk to NIR from six different changes in
the implied-forward rates. Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur
on a gradual basis every three months over the course of one year.

Trading
Portfolios     Price
risk in trading portfolios is monitored using a series of measures, including:

factor sensitivities; 
           
          value-at-risk (VAR); and 
           
          stress testing.   
       
             Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a
position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the
value of a Treasury bill for a one-basis-point change in interest rates.
Citigroup s independent market risk management ensures that factor sensitivities
are calculated, monitored and, in most cases, limited, for all relevant risks
taken in a trading
portfolio.         VAR estimates the potential decline in the
value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions. The VAR
method incorporates the factor sensitivities of the trading portfolio with the
volatilities and correlations of those factors and is expressed as the risk to
Citigroup over a one-day holding period, at a 99% confidence level. Citigroup s
VAR is based on the volatilities of and correlations among a multitude of market
risk factors as well as factors that track the specific issuer risk in debt and
equity securities.         Stress testing is performed on trading
portfolios on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market
movements. It is performed on  

both individual trading
portfolios, and on aggregations of portfolios and businesses. Independent market
risk management, in conjunction with the businesses, develops stress scenarios,
reviews the output of periodic stress-testing exercises, and uses the
information to make judgments as to the ongoing appropriateness of exposure
levels and limits.         Each trading portfolio has its own market risk
limit framework encompassing these measures and other controls, including
permitted product lists and a new product approval process for complex
products.           Total revenues of the trading
business consist of:  

customer revenue, which includes
  spreads from customer flow and   positions taken to facilitate customer orders; 
           
          proprietary trading activities in
  both cash and derivative transactions; and 
           
          net interest revenue. 

All trading positions are marked-to-market, with the result reflected in
earnings. In 2009, negative trading-related revenue (net losses) was recorded
for 58 of 260 trading days. Of the 58 days on which negative revenue (net
losses) was recorded, two days were greater than $400 million. The following
histogram of total daily revenue or loss captures trading volatility and shows
the number of days in which Citigroup s trading-related revenues fell within
particular ranges.

Citigroup periodically
performs extensive back-testing of many hypothetical test portfolios as one
check of the accuracy of its VAR. Back-testing is the process in which the daily
VAR of a portfolio is compared to the actual daily change in the market value of
its transactions. Back-testing is conducted  

to confirm that the
daily market value losses in excess of a 99% confidence level occur, on average,
only 1% of the time. The VAR calculation for the hypothetical test portfolios,
with different degrees of risk concentration, meets this statistical criteria.

91  

The level of price risk exposure at any given point in time depends on
the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements,
and will vary from period to
period.         For Citigroup s major trading centers, the
aggregate pretax VAR in the trading portfolios was $205 million at December 31,
2009 and $319 million at December 31, 2008. Daily exposures averaged $266
million in 2009 and ranged from $200 million to $335
million.          The following table summarizes VAR to
Citigroup in the trading portfolios as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, including
the total VAR, the specific risk-only component of VAR, and total general market
factors only, along with the yearly averages:  

VAR reflects the divestiture of Phibro LLC as of December 31,
2009 (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The specific
risk-only component represents the level of equity and debt issuer-specific risk
embedded in VAR.

A significant portion of Citi s business activities are based upon
gathering deposits and borrowing money and then lending or investing those
funds, including market-making activities in tradable securities. Net interest
margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing annualized gross interest revenue less
gross interest expense by average interest earning assets.  

             During the second half of 2009, the yields across both the
interest-earning assets as well as the interest-bearing liabilities dropped
significantly from the same period in 2008. The lower asset yields more than
offset the lower cost of funds, resulting in slightly lower NIM compared to the
prior-year period. The narrowing of yields in Citi s asset businesses due to the
continued de-risking of loan portfolios and expansion of loss mitigation efforts
and the natural compression of spreads in the deposit businesses, a result of
the continued low rates environment, negatively impacted NIM. The impact of
these factors was reduced by the lower asset base.

OPERATIONAL RISK    Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or human factors, or from
external events. It includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with
business practices or market conduct in which Citi is involved. Operational risk
is inherent in Citigroup s global business activities and, as with other risk
types, is managed through an overall framework designed to balance strong
corporate oversight with well-defined independent risk management. This
framework includes: 

recognized ownership of the risk
  by the businesses; 
           
          oversight by independent risk
  management; and 
           
          independent review by Citi s Audit
  and Risk Review (ARR).   
       
             The goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to
the characteristics of Citigroup s businesses, the markets in which the company
operates its capital and liquidity, and the competitive, economic and regulatory
environment. Notwithstanding these controls, Citigroup incurs operational
losses.  

Framework     To monitor, mitigate and control operational
risk, Citigroup maintains a system of comprehensive policies and has established
a consistent, value-added framework for assessing and communicating operational
risk and the overall effectiveness of the internal control environment across
Citigroup. An Operational Risk Council provides oversight for operational risk
across Citigroup. The Council s membership includes senior members of the Chief
Risk Officer s organization covering multiple dimensions of risk management with
representatives of the Business and Regional Chief Risk Officers  organizations
and the Business Management Group. The Council s focus is on further advancing
operational risk management at Citigroup with a focus on proactive
identification and mitigation of operational risk and related incidents. The
Council works with the business segments and the control functions to help
ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing
operational risk globally.         Each major business segment must implement an
operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework. The
process for operational risk management includes the following steps:

identify and assess key
  operational risks; 
           
          establish key risk
  indicators; 
           
          produce a comprehensive
  operational risk report; and 
           
          prioritize and assure adequate
  resources to actively improve the   operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks. 

The operational risk standards facilitate the effective communication and
mitigation of operational risk both within and across businesses. As new
products and business activities are developed, processes are designed, modified
or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are considered.
Information about the businesses  operational risk, historical

losses, and the control
environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area, and
is summarized and reported to senior management as well as the Risk Management
and Finance Committee of Citi s Board of Directors and the full Board of
Directors.  

Measurement
and Basel II     To
support advanced capital modeling and management, the businesses are required to
capture relevant operational risk capital information. An enhanced version of
the risk capital model for operational risk has been developed and implemented
across the major business segments as a step toward readiness for Basel II
capital calculations. The risk capital calculation is designed to qualify as an
 Advanced Measurement Approach  under Basel II. It uses a combination of
internal and external loss data to support statistical modeling of capital
requirement estimates, which are then adjusted to reflect qualitative data
regarding the operational risk and control environment. 

Information
Security and Continuity of Business     Information security and the protection of
confidential and sensitive customer data are a priority for Citigroup. Citi has
implemented an Information Security Program that complies with the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other regulatory guidance. The Information Security
Program is reviewed and enhanced periodically to address emerging threats to
customers  information.         The Corporate Office of Business Continuity,
with the support of senior management, continues to coordinate global
preparedness and mitigate business continuity risks by reviewing and testing
recovery procedures.

COUNTRY AND FFIEC CROSS-BORDER RISK
MANAGEMENT PROCESS  

Country
Risk     Country
risk is the risk that an event in a foreign country will impair the value of
Citigroup assets or will adversely affect the ability of obligors within that
country to honor their obligations to Citigroup. Country risk events may include
sovereign defaults, banking or currency crises, social instability, and changes
in governmental policies (for example, expropriation, nationalization,
confiscation of assets and other changes in legislation relating to
international ownership). Country risk includes local franchise risk, credit
risk, market risk, operational risk and cross-border
risk.         The country risk management framework at
Citigroup includes a number of tools and management processes designed to
facilitate the ongoing analysis of individual countries and their risks. These
include country risk rating models, scenario planning and stress testing,
internal watch lists, and the Country Risk Committee
process.         The Citigroup Country Risk Committee is the
senior forum to evaluate Citi s total business footprint within a specific
country franchise with emphasis on responses to current potential country risk
events. The Committee is chaired by the Head of Global Country Risk Management
and includes as its members senior risk management officers, senior regional
business heads, and senior product heads. The Committee regularly reviews all
risk exposures within a country, makes recommendations as to actions, and
follows up to ensure appropriate accountability.  

Cross-Border Risk     Cross-border risk is the risk that actions
taken by a non-U.S. government may prevent the conversion of local currency into
non-local currency and/ or the transfer of funds outside the country, among
other risks, thereby impacting the ability of Citigroup and its customers
to transact business across borders. Examples of cross-border risk include
actions taken by foreign governments such as 

exchange controls, debt
moratoria, or restrictions on the remittance of funds. These actions might
restrict the transfer of funds or the ability of Citigroup to obtain payment
from customers on their contractual obligations. See Note 32 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a recent example of this
risk.        Management oversight of cross-border risk is performed through a formal
review process that includes annual setting of cross-border limits and ongoing
monitoring of cross-border exposures, as well as monitoring of economic
conditions globally and the establishment of internal cross-border risk
management policies.        Under Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC) regulatory guidelines, total reported cross-border
outstandings include cross-border claims on third parties, as well as
investments in and funding of local franchises. Cross-border claims on third
parties (trade and short-, medium- and long-term claims) include cross-border
loans, securities, deposits with banks, investments in affiliates, and other
monetary assets, as well as net revaluation gains on foreign exchange and
derivative products.         Cross-border outstandings are reported based
on the country of the obligor or guarantor. Outstandings backed by cash
collateral are assigned to the country in which the collateral is held. For
securities received as collateral, cross-border outstandings are reported in the
domicile of the issuer of the securities. Cross-border resale agreements are
presented based on the domicile of the counterparty in accordance with FFIEC
guidelines.         Investments in and funding of local franchises
represent the excess of local country assets over local country liabilities.
Local country assets are claims on local residents recorded by branches and
majority-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup domiciled in the country, adjusted for
externally guaranteed claims and certain collateral. Local country liabilities
are obligations of non-U.S. branches and majority-owned subsidiaries of
Citigroup for which no cross-border guarantee has been issued by another
Citigroup office.  

COUNTRY AND CROSS-BORDER
RISK    The table below
shows all countries where total Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council (FFIEC) cross-border outstandings exceed 0.75% of total Citigroup
assets: 

(1)  
                       
              Included in
      total cross-border claims on third parties.  
            
              (2)  

Commitments
      (not included in total cross-border outstandings) include legally binding
      cross-border letters of credit and other commitments and contingencies as
      defined by the FFIEC. Effective March 31, 2006, the FFIEC revised the
      definition of commitments to include commitments to local residents to be
      funded with local currency local
liabilities.

DERIVATIVES  

See Note 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion and disclosures relate to Citigroup s
derivative activities. The following discussions relate to the Derivative
Obligor Information, the Fair Valuation for Derivatives and Credit Derivatives
activities.  

Derivative

obligor credit rating at December 31, 2009 and 2008, as a percentage of credit
exposure:  

The following table
presents the global derivatives portfolio by industry of the obligor as a
percentage of credit exposure: 

Fair
Valuation Adjustments for Derivatives     The fair value adjustments applied by
Citigroup to its derivative carrying values consist of the following
items: 

Liquidity adjustments are applied
  to items in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy (see Note 26 to the
  Consolidated Financial Statements for more details) to ensure that the fair
  value reflects the price at which the entire position could be liquidated. The
  liquidity reserve is based on the bid/offer spread for an instrument, adjusted
  to take into account the size of the position. 
           
          Credit valuation adjustments (CVA)
  are applied to over-the-counter derivative instruments, in which the base
  valuation generally discounts expected cash flows using LIBOR interest rate
  curves. Because not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that
  implied by the relevant LIBOR curve, a CVA is necessary to incorporate the
  market view of both counterparty credit risk and Citi s own credit risk in the
  valuation.   
       
             Citigroup CVA methodology comprises two steps. First, the exposure
profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual
derivative positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis
to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time. The
calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk
mitigants, including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of
offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting
agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable
master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated for this purpose,
since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are subject to nonperformance
risk. This process identifies specific, point-in-time future cash flows that are
subject to nonperformance risk, rather than using the current recognized net
asset or liability as a basis to measure the
CVA.         Second, market-based views of default
probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the credit default swap
market are applied to the expected future cash flows determined in step one.
Own-credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS spreads for the relevant
tenor. Generally, counterparty CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for
each credit rating and tenor. For certain identified facilities where individual
analysis is practicable (for example, exposures to monoline counterparties)
counterparty-specific CDS spreads are
used.         The CVA adjustment is designed to incorporate
a market view of the credit risk inherent in the derivative portfolio. However,
most derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not
commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative instruments are normally
settled contractually, or if terminated early, are terminated at a value
negotiated bilaterally between  

100  

the counterparties.
Therefore, the CVA (both counterparty and own-credit) may not be realized upon a
settlement or termination in the normal course of business. In addition, all or
a portion of the credit valuation adjustments may be reversed or otherwise
adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit risk of Citi or
its counterparties, or changes in the credit mitigants (collateral and netting
agreements) associated with the derivative instruments. Historically,
Citigroup s credit spreads have moved in tandem with general counterparty credit
spreads, thus providing offsetting CVAs affecting revenue. However, in the
fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroup s credit spreads generally narrowed and
counterparty credit spreads widened, each of which negatively affected revenues
in 2008. During 2009, both Citigroup s and counterparty credit spreads narrowed.
The table below summarizes the CVA applied to the fair value of derivative
instruments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Certain
      derivatives with monoline counterparties were terminated during 2008.

The table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to changes in
credit valuation adjustments on derivative instruments for the years ended

  financial instruments. Losses on non-derivative instruments, such as bonds
  and loans, related to counterparty credit risk are not included in the table
  above.   
       
          Credit
Derivatives     Citigroup makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives, both
on behalf of clients as well as for its own account. Through these contracts
Citigroup either purchases or writes protection on either a single-name or
portfolio basis. Citi uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in
its corporate loan portfolio and other cash positions, to take proprietary
trading positions, and to facilitate client
transactions.        Credit derivatives generally require that the
seller of credit protection make payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of
predefined events (settlement triggers). These settlement triggers, which are
defined by the form of the derivative and the referenced credit, are generally
limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy
(or comparable events) of the reference credit and, in a more limited range of
transactions, debt
restructuring.         Credit derivative transactions referring to
emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional
settlement triggers to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of
repudiation or a payment moratorium. In certain transactions on a portfolio of
referenced credits or asset-backed securities, the seller of protection may not
be required to make payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with
respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a
specified amount. 

101  

The following tables summarize the key characteristics of Citi s credit
derivative portfolio by counterparty and derivative form as of December 31, 2009
and December 31, 2008: 

The fair values shown are prior to the application of any netting
agreements, cash collateral, and market or credit value
adjustments.         Citigroup actively participates in trading a
variety of credit derivatives products as both an active two-way market-maker
for clients and to manage credit risk. The majority of this activity was
transacted with other financial intermediaries, including both banks and
broker-dealers. Citigroup generally has a mismatch between the total notional
amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets
directly, rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as
and when desired. The open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are
largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered
and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a duration-based equivalent
basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures.

Citi actively monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative
contracts. Approximately 85% and 88% of the gross receivables are from
counterparties with which Citi maintains collateral agreements as of December
31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A majority of Citi s top 15 counterparties (by
receivable balance owed to the company) are banks, financial institutions or
other dealers. Contracts with these counterparties do not include ratings-based
termination events. However, counterparty rating downgrades may have an
incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citigroup may call for
additional collateral. A number of the remaining significant counterparties are
monolines (which have CVA as shown above). 

102  

PENSION AND
POSTRETIREMENT PLANS 

Citigroup has several
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S.
employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity
plans covering employees outside the United States. The U.S. defined benefit
plan provides benefits under a cash balance formula. Employees satisfying
certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final pay
formula. Citigroup also offers postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain
eligible employees outside the United
States.         The following table shows the pension
(benefit) expense and contributions for Citigroup s plans:  

(1)  
                       
              The 2008
      expense includes a $23 million curtailment loss for the U.S. plans and $22
      million for the non-U.S. plans recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008
      relating to Citigroup s restructuring actions.  
            
              (2)  

In addition,
      Citigroup absorbed $11 million, $13 million and $15 million during 2009,
      2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to certain investment management
      fees and administration costs for the U.S. plans, which are excluded from
      this table.  

The following table shows the combined postretirement expense and
contributions for Citigroup s U.S. and foreign plans: 

(1)  
                       
              The 2008
      expense includes a $6 million curtailment loss related to Citigroup s
      fourth quarter of 2008 restructuring
actions.  

Expected
Rate of Return     Citigroup determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on
plan assets for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans using a  building
block  approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each
asset class. A weighted range of nominal rates is then determined based on
target allocations to each asset class. Citigroup considers the expected rate of
return to be a long-term assessment of return expectations and does not
anticipate changing this assumption annually unless there are significant
changes in investment strategy or economic conditions. This contrasts with the
selection of the discount rate, future compensation increase rate, and certain
other assumptions, which are reconsidered annually in accordance with generally
accepted accounting
principles.         The expected rate of return for the U.S.
pension and post-retirement plans was 7.75% at December 31, 2009, 7.75% at
December 31, 2008 and 8% at December 31, 2007, reflecting the performance of the
global capital markets. Actual returns in 2009 and 2008 were less than the
expected returns, while actual returns in 2007 were more than the expected
returns. This expected amount reflects the expected annual appreciation of the
plan assets and reduces the annual pension expense of Citigroup. It is deducted
from the sum of service cost, interest and other components of pension expense
to arrive at the net pension (benefit) expense. Net pension (benefit) expense
for the U.S. pension plans for 2009, 2008 and 2007 reflects deductions of $912,
$949 million and $889 million of expected returns, respectively.

103  

The following table shows the expected versus actual rate of return on
plan assets for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans:  

(1)  
                       
              Actual rates
      of return are presented gross of fees.  

For the foreign plans, pension expense for 2009 was reduced by the
expected return of $336 million, compared with the actual return of $728
million. Pension expense for 2008 and 2007 was reduced by expected returns of
$487 million and $477 million, respectively. Actual returns were higher in 2007,
but lower in 2008, than the expected returns in those years.  

Discount
Rate     The 2009
and 2008 discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans were
selected by reference to a Citigroup-specific analysis using each plan s
specific cash flows and compared with the Moody s Aa Long-Term Corporate Bond
Yield for reasonableness. Citigroup s policy is to round to the nearest tenth of
a percent. Accordingly, at December 31, 2009, the discount rate was set at 5.9%
for the pension plans and at 5.55% for the postretirement welfare
plans.         At December 31, 2008, the discount rate was
set at 6.1% for the pension plans and 6.0% for the postretirement plans,
referencing a Citigroup-specific cash flow
analysis.         At December 31, 2007, the discount rate was
set at 6.2% for the pension plans and 6.0% for the postretirement plans,
referencing a Citigroup-specific cash flow
analysis.         The discount rates for the foreign pension and
postretirement plans are selected by reference to high-quality corporate bond
rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where
developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected
by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the
additional risk for corporate
bonds.         For additional information on the pension and
postretirement plans, and on discount rates used in determining pension and
postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for Citigroup s
plans, as well as the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the expected
rates of return and the discount rates, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT
ESTIMATES  

Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of Citigroup s significant
accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting
pronouncements. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are
integral to the presentation of the company s financial condition. While all of
these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates,
this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that
require management to make highly difficult, complex, or subjective judgments
and estimates, at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and
susceptible to change. Management has discussed each of these significant
accounting policies, the related estimates, and its judgments with the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additional information about
these policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

VALUATIONS OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS    Citigroup
holds fixed-income and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in
securitizations, investments in private equity, and other financial instruments.
In addition, Citigroup purchases securities under agreements to resell and sells
securities under agreements to repurchase. Citigroup holds its investments,
trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on the
balance sheet to meet customer needs, to manage liquidity needs and interest
rate risks, and for proprietary trading and private equity
investing.        Substantially all of the assets and
liabilities described in the preceding paragraph are reflected at fair value on
Citigroup s balance sheet. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings,
long-term debt and deposits as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned
positions that are collateralized with cash are carried at fair value.
Approximately 37.6% and 34.2% of total assets, and 16.5% and 20.4% of total
liabilities, are accounted for at fair value as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.        When available, Citi generally uses quoted
market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1
of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    (see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon
internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current
market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates,
currency rates, option volatilities, etc. Where a model is internally developed
and used to price a significant product, it is subject to validation and testing
by independent personnel. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow
analysis.        Items valued using such internally generated
valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value
driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in
Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily
observable.        As seen during the second half of 2007, the
credit crisis has caused some markets to become illiquid, thus reducing the
availability of certain  

observable data used by
Citigroup s valuation techniques. This illiquidity continued through 2008 and
2009. When or if liquidity returns to these markets, the valuations will revert
to using the related observable inputs in verifying internally calculated
values. For additional information on Citigroup s fair value analysis, see
 Managing Global Risk  and  Balance Sheet Review.  

Recognition
of Changes in Fair Value     Changes in the valuation of the trading assets
and liabilities, as well as all other assets (excluding available-for-sale
securities) and liabilities carried at fair value are recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the valuation of available-for-sale
securities, other than write-offs and credit impairments, generally are recorded
in    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
   (AOCI), which is a
component of    Stockholders  equity    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A full
description of Citi s related policies and procedures can be found in Notes 1,
26, 27 and 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Evaluation
of Other-than-Temporary Impairment     Citigroup s conducts and documents periodic
reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the
impairment is other than temporary. Prior to January 1, 2009 these reviews were
conducted pursuant to FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 (now ASC 320-10-35,
   Investments Debt and Equity Securities:
    Subsequent Measurement)   . Any unrealized loss identified as other than
temporary was recorded directly in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of
January 1, 2009, Citigroup adopted ASC 320-10. Accordingly, any credit-related
impairment related to debt securities that Citi does not plan to sell and is not
likely to be required to sell is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Income, with the non-credit-related impairment recognized in AOCI. For other
impaired debt securities, the entire impairment is recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. An unrealized loss exists when the current
fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
Unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded,
net of tax, in AOCI for available-for-sale securities, while such losses related
to held-to-maturity securities are not recorded, as these investments are
carried at their amortized cost (less any other-than-temporary impairment). For
securities transferred to held-to-maturity from    Trading account assets   , amortized cost is defined as the fair value amount of the securities at
the date of transfer. For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from
available-for-sale, amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost,
plus or minus any accretion or amortization of interest, less any impairment
recognized in earnings.        Regardless of the classification of the
securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, Citi has assessed each
position for credit impairment.        For a further discussion, see Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

105  

Key
Controls over Fair Value Measurement     Citi s processes include a number of key
controls that are designed to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately,
particularly where a fair-value model is internally developed and used to price
a significant product. Such controls include a model validation policy requiring
that valuation models be validated by qualified personnel, independent from
those who created the models and escalation procedures, to ensure that
valuations using unverifiable inputs are identified and monitored on a regular
basis by senior management. 

CVA
Methodology     ASC
820-10 requires that Citi s own credit risk be considered in determining the
market value of any Citi liability carried at fair value. These liabilities
include derivative instruments as well as debt and other liabilities for which
the fair value option was elected. The credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is
recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction in the associated liability to
arrive at the fair value (carrying value) of the
liability.        Prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, Citi had
historically used its credit spreads observed in the credit default swap (CDS)
market to estimate the market value of these liabilities. Beginning in September
2008, Citi s CDS spread and credit spreads observed in the bond market (cash
spreads) diverged from each other and from their historical relationship. For
example, the three-year CDS spread narrowed from 315 basis points (bps) on
September 30, 2008, to 202 bps on December 31, 2008, while the three-year cash
spread widened from 430 bps to 490 bps over the same time period. Due to the
persistence and significance of this divergence during the fourth quarter of
2008, management determined that such a pattern may not be temporary and that
using cash spreads would be more relevant to the valuation of debt instruments
(whether issued as liabilities or purchased as assets). Therefore, Citi changed
its method of estimating the market value of liabilities for which the fair
value option was elected to incorporate Citi s cash spreads. (CDS spreads
continue to be used to calculate the CVA for derivative positions.) This change
in estimation methodology resulted in a $2.5 billion pretax gain recognized in
earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008. Citigroup recognized a pretax gain
of $4,558 million due to changes in the CVA balance in 2008. 

The table below summarizes the CVA for fair value option debt
instruments, determined under each methodology as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
and the pretax gain that would have been recognized in 2008 had each methodology
been used consistently during 2008 and 2007. 

(1)  
                       
              In changing
      the methodology for calculating the CVA reserve, Citi recorded the 2008
      cumulative difference of $2.493 billion in December 2008, resulting in a
      year-to-date pretax gain of $4.558 billion recorded in the Consolidated
      Statement of Income.  

The CVA recognized on fair value option debt instruments was $1,220
million and $5,446 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Citigroup recognized a pretax loss of $4,226 million in 2009 due to changes in
the CVA balance. The pretax loss in 2009 includes a pretax adjustment of $330
million reflecting a correction of errors in the calculation of CVA for periods
through December 31, 2008.        For a further discussion, see Notes 1 and 34
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT
LOSSES  

        Management provides
reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan
portfolio on the balance sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses.
These reserves are established in accordance with Citigroup s Credit Reserve
Policies, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Citi s
Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the credit
loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the Risk Management and
Finance staffs for each applicable business
area.        During these reviews, the above-mentioned representatives covering the
business area having classifiably managed portfolios (that is, portfolios where
internal credit risk ratings are assigned, which are primarily    ICG, Regional Consumer Banking    and    Local Consumer Lending   ) and modified consumer loans where a concession was granted due to the
borrowers  financial difficulties, and present recommended reserve balances for
their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with supporting quantitative
and qualitative data. The quantitative data include: 

Estimated probable losses for nonperforming,
  nonhomogeneous     exposures within a business line s classifiably managed
  portfolio     and impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose
  terms     have been modified due to the borrowers 
  financial difficulties, and     it was determined that a long-term concession was granted to
  the     borrower   . Consideration may be given to the
  following, as appropriate,   when
  determining this estimate: (i) the present value of expected future 
   cash flows; (ii) the borrower s
  overall financial condition, resources   and payment record; and (iii) the prospects for support from
  financially   responsible
  guarantors or the realizable value of any collateral. When   impairment is measured based on the present
  value of expected future   cash
  flows, the entire change in present value is recorded in the    Provision     for loan losses   . 
           
           Statistically calculated losses inherent in
  the classifiably managed     portfolio for performing and de minimis non-performing
  exposures   .   The calculation is based upon: (i)
  Citigroup s internal system of credit-  risk ratings, which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major
  rating   agencies; and (ii)
  historical default and loss data, including rating agency   information regarding default rates from
  1983 to 2008, and internal data   dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of
  default. 
           
           Additional adjustments
  include   : (i)
  statistically calculated estimates to   cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit
  cycle,   the historical
  variability of loss severity among defaulted loans, and   the degree to which there are large obligor
  concentrations in the global   portfolio; and (ii) adjustments made for specifically known items, such
  as   current environmental
  factors and credit trends.   
       
             In addition, representatives from both the Risk Management and Finance
staffs that cover business areas with delinquency-managed portfolios containing
smaller homogeneous loans (primarily the noncommercial 

lending areas of
Regional Consumer Banking) present their recommended reserve balances based upon
leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio
size, as well as economic trends including housing prices, unemployment and GDP.
This methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each
different geographic region in which these portfolios
exist.        This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.
The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, the size and
diversity of individual large credits, and the ability of borrowers with foreign
currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt
servicing, among other things, are all taken into account during this review.
Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any
quarter and could result in a change in the allowance. Changes to the reserve
flow through the Consolidated Statement of Income on the lines    Provision for loan losses    and    Provision for unfunded
lending       commitments   . For a
further description of the loan loss reserve and related accounts, see  Managing
Global Risk Credit Risk  and Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  

SECURITIZATIONS    Citigroup securitizes a number of different
asset classes as a means of strengthening its balance sheet and accessing
competitive financing rates in the market. Under these securitization programs,
assets are transferred into a trust and used as collateral by the trust to
obtain financing. The cash flows from assets in the trust service the
corresponding trust securities. If the structure of the trust meets certain
accounting guidelines, trust assets are treated as sold and are no longer
reflected as assets of Citi. If these guidelines are not met, the assets
continue to be recorded as Citi s assets, with the financing activity recorded
as liabilities on Citigroup s balance
sheet.        Citigroup also assists its clients in securitizing their financial assets
and packages and securitizes financial assets purchased in the financial
markets. Citi may also provide administrative, asset management, underwriting,
liquidity facilities and/or other services to the resulting securitization
entities and may continue to service some of these financial
assets. 

Elimination
of QSPEs and Changes in the       Consolidation Model for Variable Interest
Entities     In June
2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166,    Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 140    (SFAS
166),       that will eliminate Qualifying Special Purpose
Entities (QSPEs). SFAS 166 is effective for fiscal years that begin after
November 15, 2009. This change will have a significant impact on Citigroup s
Consolidated Financial Statements. Beginning January 1, 2010, Citigroup
will lose sales treatment for certain future asset transfers that would have
been considered sales under SFAS 140, and for certain transfers of portions of
assets that do not meet the definition of participating interests.  

107  

Simultaneously, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,    Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)    (SFAS 167), which details three key changes
to the consolidation model. First, former QSPEs will now be included in the
scope of SFAS 167. In addition, the FASB has changed the method of analyzing
which party to a variable interest entity (VIE) should consolidate the VIE
(known as the primary beneficiary) to a qualitative determination of which party
to the VIE has  power  combined with potentially significant benefits or losses,
instead of the current quantitative risks and rewards model. The entity that has
power has the ability to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. Finally, the new standard
requires that the primary beneficiary analysis be re-evaluated whenever
circumstances change. The current rules require reconsideration of the primary
beneficiary only when specified reconsideration events
occur.         As a result of implementing these new
accounting standards, Citigroup will consolidate certain of the VIEs and former
QSPEs with which it currently has involvement. An ongoing evaluation of the
application of these new requirements could, with the resolution of certain
uncertainties, result in the identification of additional VIEs and former QSPEs,
other than those presented below, needing to be consolidated. It is not
currently anticipated, however, that any such newly identified VIEs and former
QSPEs would have a significant impact on Citigroup s Consolidated Financial
Statements or capital
position.         In accordance with SFAS 167, Citigroup
employed three approaches for consolidating all of the VIEs and former QSPEs
that it consolidated as of January 1, 2010. The first approach requires
initially measuring the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the
VIEs and former QSPEs at their carrying values (the amounts at which the assets,
liabilities, and noncontrolling interests would have been carried in the
Consolidated Financial Statements, if Citigroup had always consolidated these
VIEs and former QSPEs). The second approach is to use the unpaid principal
amounts, where using carrying values is not practicable. The third approach is
to elect the fair value option, in which all of the financial assets and
liabilities of certain designated VIEs and former QSPEs would be recorded at
fair value upon adoption of SFAS 167 and continue to be marked to market
thereafter, with changes in fair value reported in
earnings.        Citigroup consolidated all required VIEs and
former QSPEs as of January 1, 2010 at carrying values or unpaid principal
amounts, except for certain private label residential mortgage and mutual fund
deferred sales commissions VIEs, for which the fair value option was elected.
The following tables present the pro forma impact of adopting these new
accounting standards applying these approaches.  

The pro forma impact of these changes on incremental GAAP assets and
resulting risk-weighted assets for those VIEs and former QSPEs that were
consolidated or deconsolidated for accounting purposes as of January 1, 2010
(based on financial information as of December 31, 2009), reflecting Citigroup s
present understanding of the new accounting requirements and immediate
implementation of the recently issued final risk-based capital rules regarding
SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, was as follows: 

(1)  
                       
              Citigroup
      undertook certain actions during the first and second quarters of 2009 in
      support of its off-balance-sheet credit card securitization vehicles. As a
      result of these actions, Citigroup included approximately $82 billion of
      incremental risk-weighted assets in its risk-based capital ratios as of
      March 31, 2009 and an additional approximate $900 million as of June 30,
      2009. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements.  
            
              (2)  

The
      implementation of SFAS 167 will result in the deconsolidation of certain
      synthetic and cash collateralized debt obligation (CDO) VIEs that were
      previously consolidated under the requirements of ASC 810 (FIN 46(R)).
      Upon deconsolidation of these synthetic CDOs, Citigroup s Consolidated
      Balance Sheet will reflect the recognition of current receivables and
      payables related to purchased and written credit default swaps entered
      into with these VIEs, which had previously been eliminated in
      consolidation. The deconsolidation of certain cash CDOs will have a
      minimal impact on GAAP assets, but will cause a sizable increase in
      risk-weighted assets. The impact on risk-weighted assets results from
      replacing, in Citigroup s trading account, largely investment grade
      securities owned by these VIEs when consolidated, with Citigroup s
      holdings of non-investment grade or unrated securities issued by these
      VIEs when deconsolidated.  
            
              (3)  

Certain
      equity-linked note client intermediation transactions that had previously
      been consolidated under the requirements of ASC 810 (FIN 46 (R)) will be
      deconsolidated with the implementation of SFAS 167. Upon deconsolidation,
      Citigroup s Consolidated Balance Sheet will reflect both the equity-linked
      notes issued by the VIEs and held by Citigroup as trading assets, as well
      as related trading liabilities in the form of prepaid equity derivatives.
      These trading assets and trading liabilities were formerly eliminated in
      consolidation.  

108  

The preceding table reflects (i) the estimated portion of the assets of
former QSPEs to which Citigroup, acting as principal, had transferred assets and
received sales treatment as of December 31, 2009 (totaling approximately $712.0
billion), and (ii) the estimated assets of significant unconsolidated VIEs as of
December 31, 2009 with which Citigroup is involved (totaling approximately
$219.2 billion) that are required to be consolidated under the new accounting
standards. Due to the variety of transaction structures and the level of
Citigroup involvement in individual former QSPEs and VIEs, only a portion of the
former QSPEs and VIEs with which Citi is involved are to be
consolidated.        In addition, the cumulative effect of adopting
these new accounting standards as of January 1, 2010, based on financial
information as of December 31, 2009, would result in an estimated aggregate
after-tax charge to    Retained earnings   
of approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting the net effect of an overall pretax
charge to    Retained earnings    (primarily relating to the establishment of
loan loss reserves and the reversal of residual interests held) of approximately
$13.4 billion and the recognition of related deferred tax assets amounting to
approximately $5.1 billion.        The pro forma impact on certain of
Citigroup s regulatory capital ratios of adopting these new accounting standards
(based on financial information as of December 31, 2009), reflecting immediate
implementation of the recently issued final risk-based capital rules regarding
SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, would be as follows: 

The actual impact of adopting the new accounting standards on January 1,
2010 could differ, as financial information changes from the December 31, 2009
estimates and as several uncertainties in the application of these new standards
are resolved. 

Among these uncertainties, the FASB has proposed an indefinite deferral
of the requirements of SFAS 167 for certain investment companies. Without the
proposed deferral, Citi had most recently estimated that approximately $3.3
billion of assets held by investment funds managed by Citigroup would be newly
consolidated upon the adoption of SFAS 167. If the proposed deferral were to be
finalized as currently contemplated, Citi expects that many, if not all, of
the investment vehicles managed by Citigroup would not be subject to the
requirements of SFAS 167. Nevertheless, Citigroup is continuing to evaluate the
potential impacts of the proposed requirements and, depending upon the eventual
resolution of specific implementation matters, may be required to consolidate
certain investment vehicles, the aggregate assets of which could range up to a
total of approximately $1.2 billion. The effect on Citi s regulatory capital
ratios, should consolidation of any or all such noted investment vehicles be
required, is not expected to be significant. The preceding tables reflect Citi s
view that none of the investment vehicles managed by Citigroup will be required
to be consolidated under SFAS 167. 

Proposed Changes to FDIC  Safe Harbor  Securitization
Rule  

         As described above, FASB s issuance of SFAS
Nos. 166 and 167, effective starting in the first quarter of 2010, will result
in the loss of GAAP sale treatment in certain credit card and other
securitization transactions and the consolidation of the assets of such
transactions into the assets of the sponsoring entity.  This development
has raised concerns regarding effects under the FDIC   s current  safe
harbor  securitization rule.  Under the current rule, if a securitization
is accounted for as a sale for GAAP purposes and certain other conditions are
satisfied, the FDIC, as conservator or receiver of an insolvent bank, will treat
the transferred assets as sold and surrender any right to reclaim the assets
transferred in the securitization.  If securitized assets are at risk of
seizure by the FDIC in cases of conservatorship or receivership, the credit
treatment of the securitized transactions would be impacted by the credit status
of the sponsoring bank; for example, the highest credit rating for a
securitization transaction may be limited by the credit rating of the sponsoring
bank.              On November 12, 2009, the FDIC amended its securitization rule on an
interim basis so that it will continue to apply to assets transferred in
securities transactions completed on or prior to March 31, 2010 if the transfers
would have satisfied the conditions for GAAP sale treatment in effect for
reporting periods prior to November 15, 2009.  The FDIC is currently
engaged in a rulemaking process regarding this issue, and the ultimate outcome
is unknown.  If Citi is unwilling or unable to meet the conditions of any
final rule, the highest credit rating of securities issued in its credit card
and certain other securitization transactions may be limited to its then-current
rating, and Citi may engage in a reduced level of such
transactions.  

109  

GOODWILL    Citigroup has recorded on its Consolidated
Balance Sheet    Goodwill    of $25.4 billion (1.4% of assets) and $27.1
billion (1.4% of assets) at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
respectively. No goodwill impairment was recorded during 2009. The December 31,
2008 balance is net of a $9.6 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded as a
result of testing performed as of December 31, 2008. The impairment was
composed of a $2.3 billion pretax charge ($2.0 billion after tax) related to
   North America Regional Consumer
Banking   , a $4.3 billion
pretax charge ($4.1 billion after tax) related to    Latin       America Regional Consumer Banking   , and a $3.0 billion pretax charge ($2.6
billion after tax) related to    Local Consumer Lending    Other.         The primary cause for the goodwill impairment
in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial
markets as well as in the global economic outlook, particularly during the
period beginning mid-November through year-end 2008. This deterioration further
weakened the near-term prospects for the financial services industry. The
following summary describes Citigroup s process for accounting for goodwill and
testing for impairment.        Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units
at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been allocated
to the reporting units, it generally no longer retains its identification with a
particular acquisition, but instead becomes identified with the reporting unit
as a whole. As a result, all of the fair value of each reporting unit is
available to support the value of goodwill allocated to the unit. As of December
31, 2009, Citigroup operated in three core business segments, as discussed.
Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, one level
below the business segment.        The changes in the organizational structure in
2009 resulted in the creation of new reporting segments. As a result, commencing
with the second quarter 2009, Citi identified new reporting units as required
under ASC 350,  Intangibles     Goodwill and Other   .
Goodwill affected by the reorganization has been reassigned from 10 reporting
units to nine, using a fair value approach. Subsequent to July 1, 2009, goodwill
was allocated to disposals and tested for impairment under the new reporting
units. The nine new reporting units, which remain unchanged at December 31,
2009, are    North America Regional Consumer Banking, EMEA
Regional Consumer Banking, Asia Regional Consumer Banking, LATAM Regional
Consumer Banking, Securities and Banking, Transaction Services, Brokerage and
Asset Management, Local Consumer Lending    Cards       and    Local Consumer Lending    Other.        Under ASC
350, the goodwill impairment analysis is done in two steps. The first step
requires a comparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its
carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in
excess of the carrying value, the related goodwill  

is considered not to be
impaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds the fair value, there is an indication of potential
impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of
impairment, if any, for that reporting
unit.        When required, the second step of testing involves calculating the
implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected reporting units. The
implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of
goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair
value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the
net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being
acquired. If the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit exceeds
the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price
allocation, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. A reorganized
impairment charge subsequently cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to
a reporting unit and cannot be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting
unit recovers.        Goodwill impairment testing involves
management judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of
the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual
reporting unit using widely accepted valuation techniques, such as the market
approach (earnings multiples and/or transaction multiples) and/or discounted
cash flow methods (DCF). In applying these methodologies, Citi utilizes a
number of factors, including actual operating results, future business plans,
economic projections, and market data. A combination of methodologies is used
and weighted appropriately for reporting units with significant adverse changes
in business climate. Management may engage an independent valuation specialist
to assist in Citi s valuation
process.        Prior to 2008, Citi primarily employed
the market approach for estimating fair value of the reporting units. As a
result of significant adverse changes during 2008 in certain of Citigroup
reporting units, and the increase in financial sector volatility primarily in
the U.S., Citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation
specialist to assist in Citi s valuation of all or a portion of the following
reporting units during 2009    North America Regional Consumer Banking, Latin America Regional Consumer
Banking, Securities and Banking, Local Consumer Lending    Cards and    Local Consumer Lending    Other. The DCF method was incorporated to ensure reliability of
results. Citi believes that the DCF method, using management projections
for the selected reporting units and an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate,
is most reflective of a market participant s view of fair values given current
market conditions. For the reporting units where both methods were utilized in
2009, the resulting fair values were relatively consistent and appropriate
weighting was given to outputs from both methods. 

110  

The DCF method used at the time of each impairment test used discount
rates that Citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in
the financial markets generally and specifically in the internally generated
cash flow projections. The DCF method employs a capital asset pricing model in
estimating the discount rate. Citi continues to value the remaining reporting
units where it believes the risk of impairment to be low, using primarily the
market approach.        Citi prepares a formal three-year strategic
plan for its businesses on an annual basis. These projections incorporate
certain external economic projections developed at the point in time the
strategic plan is developed. For the purpose of performing any impairment test,
the three-year forecast is updated by Citi to reflect current economic
conditions as of the testing date. Citi used updated long-range financial
forecasts as a basis for its interim goodwill impairment test performed as of
April 1, 2009 and its annual goodwill impairment test performed as of July 1,
2009 (as discussed below). The 2009 Strategic Plan incorporating the most
current market outlook was the basis for the interim impairment test as of
November 30, 2009 (as discussed
below).        As discussed above, management tests goodwill for impairment annually as
of July 1. The results of the July 1, 2009 test validated that the fair values
exceeded the carrying values for all reporting units. Citi is also required to
test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances make it more
likely than not that impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse
change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a
significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant decline in Citi s
stock price. Implementation of the new organizational structure as of the second
quarter of 2009 resulted in the performance of an interim goodwill impairment
test and reallocation of goodwill among new reporting units as of April 1, 2009.
An interim goodwill impairment test for Citigroup was performed for both the
pre-reorganization reporting units and the post-reorganization reporting units
as of April 1, 2009. Results of the test indicated no goodwill impairment for
any of the pre- or post-reorganization reporting units. Based on negative
macro-economic and industry-specific factors, Citigroup performed an additional
impairment test for its    Local Consumer Lending    Cards reporting unit as of November 30, 2009. The test validated that the
fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of the associated carrying value
and, therefore, that there was no indication of goodwill
impairment.        Since none of the Company s reporting units
are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot
be directly correlated to Citigroup s stock price. The sum of the fair values of
the reporting units significantly exceeds the overall market capitalization of
Citi. 

However, Citi believes
that it is not meaningful to reconcile the sum of the fair values of the
Company s reporting units to its market capitalization due to several factors.
These factors, which do not directly impact the individual reporting unit fair
values, include the significant economic stake and influence held by the U.S.
government in Citi. In addition, the market capitalization of Citigroup reflects
the execution risk in a transaction involving Citigroup due to its size.
However, the individual reporting units  fair values are not subject to the same
level of execution risk or a business model that is perceived to be
complex.        While no impairment was noted in step one of
Citigroup s    Local Consumer Lending    Cards       reporting unit
impairment test at November 30, 2009, goodwill present in that reporting unit
may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions.
Under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit, the earnings
multiples and transaction multiples were selected from multiples obtained using
data from guideline companies and acquisitions. The selection of the actual
multiple considers operating performance and financial condition such as return
on equity and net income growth of    Local Consumer Lending    Cards as compared to the guideline companies and acquisitions. For the
valuation under the income approach, Citi utilized a discount rate that it
believes reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the projected cash flows,
and selected 2012 as the terminal
year.        Small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations, in
particular the discount-rate and growth-rate assumptions used in the net income
projections, could significantly affect Citigroup s impairment evaluation and,
hence, results. If the future were to differ adversely from management s best
estimate of key economic assumptions, and associated cash flows were to decrease
by a small margin, Citi could potentially experience future material impairment
charges with respect to $4,683 million of goodwill remaining in our    Local Consumer Lending    Cards reporting unit. Any such charges, by themselves, would not
negatively affect Citi s Tier 1 and Total Capital regulatory ratios, or Tier 1
Common ratio, its Tangible Common Equity or Citi s liquidity
position. 

111  

INCOME TAXES    Citigroup is subject to the income tax
laws of the U.S., its states and local municipalities, and the foreign
jurisdictions in which Citi operates. These tax laws are complex and subject to
different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing
authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, Citi must make
judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex
tax laws. Citi must also make estimates about when in the future certain items
will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and
foreign.        Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws
may be subject to review / adjudication by the court systems of the various tax
jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit. Deferred
taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been
recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax
laws and rates. Deferred tax assets (DTAs) are recognized subject to
management s judgment that realization is more likely than
not.        Although realization is not assured, Citi believes that the realization
of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $46.1 billion at December 31, 2009
is more likely than not based on expectations as to future taxable income in the
jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, and based on available tax planning
strategies as defined in ASC 740 that could be implemented if necessary to
prevent a carryforward from
expiring.        The following table summarizes Citi s DTA
balance at December 31, 2009 and 2008: 

Included in the net U.S. federal DTA of $36.3 billion are   deferred tax liabilities
of $5 billion that will reverse in the relevant carryforward period and may
be   used to support the DTA and $0.5 billion in compensation
deductions that reduced additional paid-in capital in January 2010 and for which
no adjustment to such DTA is permitted at December 31, 2009, because the related
stock compensation was not yet deductible to Citi. Included in Citi s overall
net DTA of $46.1 billion are $25 billion of future tax deductions and credits
that arose largely due to timing differences between the recognition of income
for GAAP and tax and represent net deductions and credits that have not yet been
taken on a tax return. The most significant source of these timing differences
is the loan loss reserve build, which accounts for approximately $15 billion of
the net DTA.  In general, Citi would need to generate approximately
$86 billion of taxable income during the respective carryforward periods to
fully realize its U.S. federal, state and local
DTAs.        As a result of the recent losses incurred, Citi is in a three-year
cumulative pretax loss position at December 31, 2009. A cumulative loss position
is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a
DTA. Citi has concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence to overcome
this negative evidence. The positive evidence includes two means by which Citi
is able to fully realize its DTA. First, Citi forecasts sufficient taxable
income in the carryforward period, exclusive of tax planning strategies, even
under stressed scenarios. Secondly, Citi has sufficient tax planning strategies,
including potential sales of businesses and assets, in which it could realize
the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of its assets, in an amount
sufficient to fully realize its DTA. The amount of the DTA considered
realizable, however, could be significantly reduced in the near term if
estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are
significantly lower than forecasted due to deterioration in market
conditions.        Based upon the foregoing discussion, as well
as tax planning opportunities and other factors discussed below, the U.S.
federal and New York State and City net operating loss carryforward period of 20
years provides enough time to utilize the DTAs pertaining to the existing net
operating loss carryforwards and any NOL that would be created by the reversal
of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax
return. 

112  

The U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward period is 10 years. In addition,
utilization of foreign tax credits in any year is restricted to 35% of foreign
source taxable income in that year. Further, overall domestic losses that Citi
has incurred of approximately $45 billion are allowed to be reclassified as
foreign source income to the extent of 50% of domestic source income produced in
subsequent years, and such resulting foreign source income is in fact sufficient
to cover the foreign tax credits being carried forward. As such, the foreign
source taxable income limitation will not be an impediment to the foreign tax
credit carryforward usage as long as Citi can generate sufficient domestic
taxable income within the 10-year carryforward
period.        Regarding the estimate of future taxable income, Citi has projected its
pretax earnings, predominantly based upon the  core  businesses that Citi
intends to conduct going forward. These  core  businesses have produced steady
and strong earnings in the past. During 2008 and 2009, the  core  businesses
were negatively affected by the large increase in consumer credit losses during
this sharp downturn in the economic cycle. Citigroup has already taken steps to
reduce its cost structure. Taking these items into account, Citi is projecting
that it will generate sufficient pretax earnings within the 10-year carryforward
period alluded to above to be able to fully utilize the foreign tax credit
carryforward, in addition to any foreign tax credits produced in such
period.        Citi has also examined tax planning strategies available to it in
accordance with ASC 740 that would be employed, if necessary, to prevent a
carryforward from expiring. These strategies include repatriating low-taxed
foreign earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely
reinvested has not been made, accelerating taxable income into or deferring
deductions out of the latter years of the carryforward period with reversals to
occur after the carryforward period (e.g., selling appreciated intangible assets
and electing straight-line depreciation), holding onto available-for-sale debt
securities with losses until they mature and selling certain assets that produce
tax-exempt income, while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income. In
addition, the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce
significant taxable income within the relevant carryforward
periods.        Citi s ability to utilize its deferred tax
assets to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if Citi
experiences an  ownership change,  as defined in Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). In general, an ownership change
will occur if there is a cumulative change in Citi s ownership by  5%
shareholders  (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a
rolling three-year period. 

The common stock issued pursuant to the exchange offers in July 2009 and
the common stock  and tangible equity units issued in December 2009 as
part of Citigroup s TARP repayment did not result in an ownership change under
the Code. However, these common stock issuances have materially increased the
risk that Citigroup will experience  an ownership change in the
future. On June 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Citigroup adopted a tax
benefits preservation plan (the  Plan ). This Plan is subject to the
shareholders  approval at the 2010 Annual Meeting. The purpose of the Plan is to
minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring for Section 382
purposes. Despite adoption of the Plan, future transactions in our stock that
may not be in our control may cause Citi to experience an ownership change and
thus limit Citi s ability to utilize its deferred tax asset as well
as cause a reduction in its TCE and stockholders  equity.        Approximately $15 billion of the net
DTA is included in Tier 1 Common and Tier 1 Capital. 

             See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further
description of Citi s tax provision and related income tax assets and
liabilities.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure     Citigroup s disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC
filings.        Citi s Disclosure Committee is responsible for
ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing,
maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for Citi s
external disclosures.        Citigroup s management, with the participation
of the company s CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2009 and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and
CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. 

Financial
Reporting     There
were no changes in Citigroup s internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2009 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Citi s internal control over financial
reporting. 

115  

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING  

The management of
Citigroup is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act). Citigroup s internal control system is designed to provide
reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.        Management maintains a comprehensive system of
controls intended to ensure that transactions are executed in accordance with
management s authorization, assets are safeguarded, and financial records are
reliable. Management also takes steps to ensure that information and
communication flows are effective and to monitor performance, including
performance of internal control
procedures.        Citigroup management assessed the
effectiveness of Citigroup s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December
31, 2009, Citigroup s internal control over financial reporting is
effective.        The effectiveness of Citigroup s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by
KPMG LLP, Citigroup s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report below, which expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of Citigroup s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM         INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.: 

We
have audited Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries  (the  Company  or  Citigroup )
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in  Internal
Control   Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control
over financial reporting based on our
audit .        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion .        A 
company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  

maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.         B ecause
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate .        I n
our opinion, Citigroup maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in  Internal Control Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission .        W e
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Citigroup as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders  equity and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated
February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements .

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM         CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.: 

W  e
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citigroup Inc. and
subsidiaries (the  Company  or  Citigroup ) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders 
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2009, and the related consolidated balance sheets of Citibank, N.A.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our
audits  .         We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Citigroup as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and the
financial position of Citibank, N.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles   .  

               As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2009, the
Company changed its method of accounting for other-than-temporary impairments on
investment securities, business combinations, noncontrolling interests in
subsidiaries, and earnings per share.  

                 We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Citigroup s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   

Principles of
Consolidation  

        The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries (the
Company). The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it exercises control.
Entities where the Company holds 20% to 50% of the voting rights and/or has the
ability to exercise significant influence, other than investments of designated
venture capital subsidiaries, or investments accounted for at fair value under
the fair value option, are accounted for under the equity method, and the pro
rata share of their income (loss) is included in    Other revenue   .
Income from investments in less than 20%-owned companies is recognized when
dividends are received. As discussed below, Citigroup consolidates entities
deemed to be variable-interest entities when Citigroup is determined to be the
primary beneficiary. Gains and losses on the disposition of branches,
subsidiaries, affiliates, buildings, and other investments and charges for
management s estimate of impairment in their value that is other than temporary,
such that recovery of the carrying amount is deemed unlikely, are included in
   Other revenue   .  

              Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior-period s financial statements and
notes to conform to the current period s presentation.  

Citibank, N.A.  

        Citibank, N.A. is a
commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. Citibank s
principal offerings include consumer finance, mortgage lending, and retail
banking products and services; investment banking, commercial banking, cash
management, trade finance and e-commerce products and services; and private
banking products and services.  

              The Company includes
a balance sheet and statement of changes in stockholder s equity for Citibank,
N.A. to provide information about this entity to shareholders and international
regulatory agencies. (See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion.)  

Variable Interest
Entities  

        An entity is referred to
as a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets the criteria outlined in ASC
810,    Consolidation    (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),
   Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
(revised December 2003)   
(FIN 46(R)), which are: (1) the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit
the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties, or (2) the entity has equity investors that cannot
make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb
their proportionate share of the expected losses or receive the expected returns
of the entity.  

              In addition, a VIE
must be consolidated by the Company if it is deemed to be the primary
beneficiary of the VIE, which is the party involved with the VIE that has a
majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns
or both.  

              Along with the VIEs
that are consolidated in accordance with these guidelines, the Company has
significant variable interests in other VIEs that are not consolidated because
the Company is not the primary beneficiary.  

These include
multi-seller finance companies, certain collateralized debt obligations (CDOs),
many structured finance transactions, and various investment funds.

However, these VIEs
as well as all other unconsolidated VIEs are regularly monitored by the Company
to determine if any reconsideration events have occurred that could cause its
primary beneficiary status to change. These events include: 

additional purchases or sales of
  variable interests by Citigroup or an   unrelated third party, which cause Citigroup s overall variable
  interest   ownership to
  change; 
           
          changes in contractual
  arrangements in a manner that reallocates expected   losses and residual returns among the
  variable interest holders; and 
           
          providing support to an entity
  that results in an implicit variable interest.   
       
              All other entities
not deemed to be VIEs with which the Company has involvement are evaluated for
consolidation under other subtopics of ASC 810 (formerly Accounting Research
Bulletin (ARB) No. 51,    Consolidated Financial Statements   , SFAS No. 94,    Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries   , and EITF Issue No. 04-5,  Determining
Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a
Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain
Rights. )  

Foreign Currency
Translation  

        Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
year-end spot foreign-exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated
monthly at amounts that approximate weighted average exchange rates, with
resulting transaction gains and losses included in income. The effects of
translating net assets with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are
included in a separate component of stockholders  equity along with related
hedge and tax effects. The effects of translating income from transactions
denominated in foreign currency subsidiaries with the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency, including those in highly inflationary environments, are
primarily included in    Other revenue    along
with the related hedge effects. Hedges of foreign currency exposures include
forward foreign currency, option and swap contracts and designated issues of
non-U.S. dollar debt.  

Investment Securities  

        Investments include
fixed income and equity securities. Fixed income instruments include bonds,
notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and
structured securities that are subject to prepayment risk. Equity securities
include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks. Investment securities are
classified and accounted for as follows:  

Fixed income securities classified
  as  held-to-maturity  represent   securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to
  hold   until maturity, and are
  carried at amortized cost. Interest income on such   securities is included in    Interest revenue   .   

126  

Fixed income securities and
  marketable equity securities classified   as  available-for-sale  are carried at fair
  value with changes in fair   value reported in a separate component of    Stockholders  equity   , net   of applicable
  income taxes. As set out in Note 16 to the Consolidated   Financial Statements, declines in fair value
  that are determined to be   other
  than temporary are recorded in earnings immediately. Realized   gains and losses on sales are included in
  income primarily on a specific   identification cost basis, and interest and dividend income on
  such   securities is included in
     Interest revenue   . 
           
          Venture capital investments held
  by Citigroup s private equity subsidiaries   that are considered investment companies are
  carried at fair value with   changes in fair value reported in    Other revenue   .
  These subsidiaries   include
  entities registered as Small Business Investment Companies and   engage exclusively in venture capital
  activities. 
           
          Certain investments in
  non-marketable equity securities and certain   investments that would otherwise have been
  accounted for using the   equity
  method are carried at fair value, since the Company has elected to 
   apply fair value accounting. Changes
  in fair value of such investments are   recorded in earnings. 
           
          Certain non-marketable equity
  securities are carried at cost and   periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment, as set out
  in   Note 16 to the Consolidated
  Financial Statements.   
       
              For investments in
fixed-income securities classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale,
accrual of interest income is suspended for investments that are in default or
on which it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as
scheduled.  

              The Company uses a
number of valuation techniques for investments carried at fair value, which are
described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Trading Account Assets and
Liabilities  

         Trading account assets    include debt and marketable equity
securities, derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in
securitizations and physical commodities inventory. In addition (as set out in
Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), certain assets that Citigroup
has elected to carry at fair value under the fair value option, such as loans
and purchased guarantees, are also included in    Trading account assets   .  

               Trading account
liabilities    include
securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions), and derivatives in a net
payable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has elected to
carry at fair value, as set out in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  

              Other than physical
commodities inventory, all trading account assets and liabilities are carried at
fair value. Revenues generated from trading assets and trading liabilities are
generally reported in    Principal transactions    and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and
losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Interest
income on trading assets is recorded in    Interest revenue    reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities.  

Physical commodities
inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market (LOCOM) with related gains
or losses reported in    Principal transactions   . Realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are
included in    Principal transactions    on a  first in, first out  basis.

Derivatives used for
trading purposes include interest rate, currency, equity, credit, and commodity
swap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial and commodity
futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset and liability positions are
presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a valid
master netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out in ASC 210-20,
   Balance Sheet Offsetting    (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 39,
 Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts ) are met.  

              The Company uses a
number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and
liabilities, all of which are described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  

Securities Borrowed and Securities
Loaned  

        Securities borrowing and
lending transactions generally do not constitute a sale of the underlying
securities for accounting purposes, and so are treated as collateralized
financing transactions when the transaction involves the exchange of cash. Such
transactions are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus
accrued interest. As set out in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number
of securities borrowing and lending transactions. Irrespective of whether the
Company has elected fair value accounting, fees paid or received for all
securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded in    Interest expense    or
   Interest revenue    at the contractually specified rate.

Where the conditions
of ASC 210-20 are met, amounts recognized in respect of securities borrowed and
securities loaned are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

With respect to
securities borrowed or loaned, the Company pays or receives cash collateral in
an amount in excess of the market value of securities borrowed or loaned. The
Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily
basis with additional collateral received or paid as necessary.  

              As described in Note
26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash
flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing
transactions.  

Repurchase and Resale
Agreements  

        Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under agreements to
resell (reverse repos) generally do not constitute a sale for accounting
purposes of the underlying securities, and so are treated as collateralized
financing transactions. As set out in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a majority
of such transactions, with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Any
transactions for which fair value accounting has not been elected are recorded
at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective
of whether the Company has elected fair value accounting, interest paid or
received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in    Interest expense    or
   Interest revenue    at the contractually specified rate.

127  

Where the conditions
of ASC 210-20-45-11,    Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase
Agreements    (formerly FASB
Interpretation No. 41,  Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and
Reverse Repurchase Agreements ), are met, repos and reverse repos are presented
net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

              The Company s policy
is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The
market value of securities to be repurchased and resold is monitored, and
additional collateral is obtained where appropriate to protect against credit
exposure.  

              As described in Note
26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash
flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo
transactions.  

Loans  

        Loans are reported at
their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized
deferred fees and costs except that credit card receivable balances also include
accrued interest and fees. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination
costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the
lives of the related loans.  

              As described in Note
27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected fair value
accounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair value with changes
in fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on such loans is recorded in
   Interest revenue    at the contractually specified rate.

Loans for which the
fair value option has not been elected are classified upon origination or
acquisition as either held-for-investment or held-for-sale. This classification
is based on management s initial intent and ability with regard to those loans.

Loans that are
held-for-investment are classified as    Loans, net of unearned income    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the
related cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities
category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line    Change in loans   .
However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed from
held-for-investment to held-for-sale, the loan is reclassified to held-for-sale,
but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing
activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line    Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans   .  

              Substantially all of
the consumer loans sold or securitized by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential
mortgage loans or U.S. credit card receivables. The practice of the U.S. prime
mortgage business has been to sell all of its loans except for non-conforming
adjustable rate loans. U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans are classified as
held-for-sale at the time of origination. The related cash flows are classified
in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from operating
activities category on the line    Change in loans held-for-sale   .  

              U.S. credit card
receivables are classified at origination as loans-held-for-sale to the extent
that management does not have the intent to hold the receivables for the
foreseeable future or until maturity. The U.S. credit card securitization
forecast for the three months following the latest balance sheet date, excluding
replenishments, is the basis for the amount of such loans classified as
held-for-sale.  

Cash flows related to
U.S. credit card loans classified as held-for-sale at origination or acquisition
are reported in the cash flows from operating activities category on the line
   Change in loans
held-for-sale   .

Consumer loans  

        Consumer loans represent
loans and leases managed primarily by the    Regional Consumer Banking    and    Local Consumer Lending    businesses. As a general rule, interest
accrual ceases for installment and real estate (both open- and closed-end) loans
when payments are 90 days contractually past due. For credit cards and unsecured
revolving loans, however, the Company generally accrues interest until payments
are 180 days past due. Loans that have been modified to grant a short-term or
long-term concession to a borrower who is in financial difficulty may not be
accruing interest at the time of the modification. The policy for returning such
modified loans to accrual status varies by product and/or region. In most
cases, a minimum number of payments (ranging from one to six) are required,
while in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual status.  

              Citi s charge-off
policies follow the general guidelines below: 

Unsecured installment loans are
  charged off at 120 days past due.  
           
          Unsecured revolving loans and
  credit card loans are charged off at 180 days contractually past
  due.  
           
          Loans secured with non-real estate
  collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less
  costs to sell, at 120 days past due.  
           
          Real estate-secured loans are
  written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at
  180 days contractually past due.  
           
          Non-bank loans secured by real
  estate are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to
  sell, at the earlier of the receipt of title or 12 months in foreclosure (a
  process that must commence when payments are 120 days contractually past
  due).  
           
          Non-bank auto loans are written
  down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at
  repossession or, if repossession is not pursued, no later than 180 days
  contractually past due.  
           
          Non-bank unsecured personal loans
  are charged off when the loan is 180 days contractually past due if there have
  been no payments within the last six months, but in no event can these loans
  exceed 360 days contractually past due.  
           
          Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are
  charged off within 30 days of notification of filing by the bankruptcy court
  or within the contractual write-off periods, whichever occurs
  earlier.  
           
          Real estate-secured loans in
  bankruptcy are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs
  to sell, 60 days after notification if the borrower is 60 days contractually
  past due. 
           
          Non-bank unsecured personal loans
  in bankruptcy are charged off when they are 30 days contractually past due.

128  

Corporate loans  

        Corporate loans
represent loans and leases managed by    ICG    or the
   Special Asset Pool   . Corporate loans are identified as impaired
and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined that the payment
of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 days
past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of
collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is
reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is
thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash.
When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all cash
receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan.

Impaired corporate
loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be
uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment
is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and
there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written down
to the lower of cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to an
accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are
reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment
performance in accordance with the contractual terms. 

Loans Held-for-Sale  

        Corporate and consumer loans that
have been identified for sale are classified as loans held-for-sale included in
   Other assets   . With the exception of certain mortgage loans
for which the fair value option has been elected, these loans are accounted for
at the lower of cost or market value (LOCOM), with any write-downs or subsequent
recoveries charged to    Other revenue   .

Allowance for Loan
Losses  

        Allowance for loan losses
represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the
portfolio, as well as probable losses related to large individually evaluated
impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings. Attribution of the allowance is
made for analytical purposes only, and the entire allowance is available to
absorb probable credit losses inherent in the overall portfolio. Additions to
the allowance are made through the provision for credit losses. Credit losses
are deducted from the allowance, and subsequent recoveries are added. Securities
received in exchange for loan claims in debt restructurings are initially
recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or
charge-off to the allowance, and are subsequently accounted for as securities
available-for-sale.  

Corporate loans  

        In the Corporate
portfolios, the allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component
and a statistically-based component. The asset specific component is calculated
under ASC 310-10-35,    Receivables Subsequent Measurement    (formerly SFAS 114) on an individual basis
for larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans, which are considered impaired. An
asset-specific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows,
collateral value (less disposal costs), or observable market price of the
impaired loan is lower than its carrying value. This allowance considers the
borrower s overall financial condition, resources, and payment record, the
prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and, if
appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. The asset specific
component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loans is calculated on a
pool basis considering historical loss experience. The allowance for the
remainder of the loan portfolio is calculated under ASC 450,    Contingencies   
(formerly SFAS 5) using a statistical methodology, supplemented by management
judgment. The statistical analysis considers the portfolio s size, remaining
tenor, and credit quality as measured by internal risk ratings assigned to
individual credit facilities, which reflect probability of default and loss
given default. The statistical analysis considers historical default rates and
historical loss severity in the event of default, including historical average
levels and historical variability. The result is an estimated range for inherent
losses. The best estimate within the range is then determined by management s
quantitative and qualitative assessment of current conditions, including general
economic conditions, specific industry and geographic trends, and internal
factors including portfolio concentrations, trends in internal credit quality
indicators, and current and past underwriting standards.  

Consumer loans  

        For    Consumer loans   ,
each portfolio of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans including consumer
mortgage, installment, revolving credit, and most other consumer loans is
independently evaluated for impairment. The allowance for loan losses attributed
to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses
inherent in the specific portfolio based upon various analyses. These include
migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience
is applied to the current aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that
reflect current trends and conditions.  

              Management also
considers overall portfolio indicators, including historical credit losses,
delinquent, non-performing, and classified loans, trends in volumes and terms of
loans, an evaluation of overall credit quality, the credit process, including
lending policies and procedures, and economic, geographical, product and other
environmental factors.  

              In addition,
valuation allowances are determined for impaired smaller-balance homogeneous
loans whose terms have been modified due to the borrowers  financial
difficulties and where it has been determined that a concession will be granted
to the borrower. Such modifications may include interest rate reductions,
principal forgiveness and/or term extensions. Where long-term concessions have
been granted, such modifications are accounted for  

129  

as  Troubled Debt
Restructurings  (TDRs). The allowance for loan losses for TDRs is determined by
comparing expected cash flows of the loans discounted at the loans 
original effective interest rates to the carrying value of the loans. Where
short-term concessions have been granted, the allowance for loan losses is
calculated by the analyses described above for smaller-balance, homogeneous
loans and also reflects the estimated future credit losses for those
loans. 

Reserve Estimates and
Policies  

        Management provides reserves for an
estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the balance
sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses. These reserves are
established in accordance with Citigroup s Credit Reserve Policies, as approved
by the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The Company s Chief
Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss
reserves each quarter with representatives from the Risk Management and Finance
staffs for each applicable business area.  

              The above-mentioned
representatives covering the business areas having classifiably managed
portfolios, where internal credit-risk ratings are assigned (primarily
   ICG, Regional Consumer Banking  and  Local Consumer Lending   ), or modified consumer loans, where
concessions were granted due to the borrowers  financial difficulties present
recommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios
along with supporting quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data
include:  

Estimated probable losses for
  non-performing, non-homogeneous     exposures within a business line s classifiably managed portfolio
  and     impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans
  whose terms have     been modified due to the borrowers  financial difficulties, and it
  was     determined that a long-term concession was
  granted to the borrower.    Consideration may be given to the following, as appropriate, when
  determining this estimate: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows
  discounted at the loan s original effective rate; (ii) the borrower s overall
  financial condition, resources and payment record; and (iii) the prospects for
  support from financially responsible guarantors or the realizable value of any
  collateral. When impairment is measured based on the present value of expected
  future cash flows, the entire change in present value is recorded in the  Provision for loan losses . 
           
          Statistically calculated
  losses inherent in the classifiably managed    portfolio for performing and de minimis non-performing
  exposures   .   The calculation is
  based upon: (i) Citigroup s internal system of credit-risk   ratings, which are analogous to the risk
  ratings of the major rating agencies;   and (ii) historical default and loss data, including rating-agency
  information   regarding default
  rates from 1983 to 2008, and internal data dating to the early   1970s on severity of losses in the event of
  default. 
           
           Additional adjustments
  include   : (i)
  statistically calculated estimates to   cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit
  cycle,   the historical
  variability of loss severity among defaulted loans, and   the degree to which there are large obligor
  concentrations in the global   portfolio; and (ii) adjustments made for specifically known items, such
  as   current environmental
  factors and credit trends.   

In addition,
representatives from both the Risk Management and Finance staffs that cover
business areas that have delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller
homogeneous loans (primarily the non-commercial lending areas of    Regional Consumer Banking   ) present their recommended reserve balances based upon leading credit
indicators, including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well
as economic trends including housing prices, unemployment and GDP. This
methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each
different geographic region in which these portfolios exist.  

              This evaluation
process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The frequency of
default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, the size and diversity of individual
large credits, and the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to
obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing, among other
things, are all taken into account during this review. Changes in these
estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs in any quarter and
could result in a change in the allowance. Changes to the reserve flow through
the Consolidated Statement of Income on the lines    Provision for loan losses  and 
Provision for unfunded lending commitments.      Additional information on the allowance for loan
losses is included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.   

Allowance for Unfunded Lending
Commitments  

        A similar approach to
the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected
losses related to unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. This
reserve is classified on the balance sheet in    Other liabilities   . 

Mortgage Servicing Rights
(MSRs)  

        Mortgage servicing
rights (MSRs)   are recognized as
intangible assets when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans
acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the
loans.  

Servicing rights in
the U.S. mortgage and student loan classes of servicing rights are accounted for
at fair value, with changes in value recorded in current earnings. 

                Additional
information on the Company s MSRs can be found in Note 23 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. 

Representations and
Warranties  

          When selling a loan, the
Company makes various representations and warranties relating to, among other
things, the following: 

the Company s ownership of the
  loan; 
             
            the validity of the lien securing
  the loan; 
             
            the absence of delinquent taxes or
  liens against the property securing the loan; 
             
            the effectiveness of title
  insurance on the property securing the loan; 
             
            the process used in selecting the
  loans for inclusion in a transaction; 
             
            the loan s compliance with any
  applicable loan criteria (e.g., loan balance   limits, property type, delinquency status)
  established by the buyer; and 
             
            the loan s compliance with
  applicable local, state and federal laws.   

130  

Citigroup s
repurchases are primarily from Government Sponsored Entities. The specific
representations and warranties made by the Company depend on the nature of the
transaction and the requirements of the buyer. Market conditions and
credit-ratings agency requirements may also affect representations and
warranties and the other provisions the Company may agree to in loan
sales. 

              In the event of a
breach of the representations and warranties, the Company may be required to
either repurchase the mortgage loans (generally at unpaid principal balance plus
accrued interest) with the identified defects or indemnify ( make-whole ) the
investor or insurer. The Company has recorded a repurchase reserve
that is included in    Other liabilities   
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the case of a repurchase, the Company will
bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans. The Company s
representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in
amount or time of coverage. However, contractual liability arises only when the
representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss
results from the breach. In the case of a repurchase, the loan is typically
considered a credit-impaired loan and accounted for under SOP 03-3,  Accounting
for Certain Loans and Debt Securities, Acquired in a Transfer  (now incorporated
into ASC 310-30,    Receivables Loans and Debt Securities Acquired
with Deteriorated Credit Quality   ). These repurchases have not had a material impact on nonperforming loan
statistics, because credit-impaired purchased SOP 03-3 loans are not included in
nonaccrual loans. 

              The Company estimates
its exposure to losses from its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans
based on the probability of repurchase or make-whole and an estimated loss given
repurchase or make-whole. This estimate is calculated separately by sales
vintage (i.e., the year the loans were sold) based on a combination of
historical trends and forecasted repurchases and losses considering the: (1)
trends in requests by investors for loan documentation packages to be reviewed;
(2) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes; (3) historical percentage of
claims made as a percentage  of loan
documentation package requests; (4) success rate in appealing claims; (5)
inventory of unresolved claims; and (6) estimated loss given repurchase or
make-whole, including the loss of principal, accrued interest, and foreclosure
costs. The Company does not change its estimation methodology by
counterparty, but the historical experience and trends are considered when
evaluating the overall reserve.  

                The request for loan
documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim. During 2009,
loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims
increased. In addition, our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to
the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience. These factors
contributed to a $493 million change in estimate for this reserve in
2009. 

                As indicated above,
the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage. The majority of the
repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages, which also
represent the vintages with the largest loss-given-repurchase. An insignificant
percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006, and this is
expected to decrease, because those 

vintages are later in
the credit cycle. Although early in the credit cycle, the Company has
experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the
2008 and 2009 vintages. 

              In the case of a
repurchase of a credit-impaired SOP 03-3 loan (now incorporated into ASC
310-30), the difference between the loan s fair value and unpaid principal
balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the
repurchase reserve. Payments to make the investor whole are also treated as
utilizations and charged directly against the reserve. The provision for
estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment
to the gain on sale, which is included in    Other revenue    in
the Consolidated Statement of Income. A liability for representations and
warranties is estimated when the Company sells loans and is updated quarterly.
Any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in    Other revenue    in
the Consolidated Statement of Income.  

              The activity in the
repurchase reserve for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as
follows: 

Goodwill  

         Goodwill    represents an acquired company s acquisition
cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. 
  Goodwill    is subject to annual impairment tests,
whereby    Goodwill    is allocated to the Company s reporting units
and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its estimated fair value. Furthermore, on any business
dispositions,    Goodwill    is allocated to the business disposed of based
on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of
the reporting unit. 

Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets    including core deposit intangibles, present
value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, other customer
relationships, and other intangible assets, but excluding MSRs are amortized
over their estimated useful lives.    Intangible assets    deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily certain asset
management contracts and trade names, are not amortized and are subject to
annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the
indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For other    Intangible assets   
subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is
not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the    Intangible asset   .

Other Assets and Other
Liabilities  

           Other assets    include, among other items, loans
held-for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees
receivable, premises and equipment, end-user derivatives in a net receivable
position, repossessed assets, and other receivables.

131  

Other
liabilities    includes,
among other items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax
liabilities, minority interest, end-user derivatives in a net payable position,
and reserves for legal claims, taxes, restructuring reserves for unfunded
lending commitments, and other matters.  

Repossessed Assets  

        Upon repossession, loans are
adjusted, if necessary, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral
and transferred to repossessed assets. This is reported in    Other assets   , net
of a valuation allowance for selling costs and net declines in value as
appropriate.  

Securitizations  

        The Company primarily securitizes
credit card receivables and mortgages. Other types of securitized assets include
corporate debt instruments (in cash and synthetic form) and student loans.

There are two key
accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations. First,
in the case where Citigroup originated or owned the financial assets transferred
to the securitization entity, a decision must be made as to whether that
transfer is considered a sale under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). If it is a sale, the transferred assets are removed from the
Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet with a gain or loss recognized.
Alternatively, when the transfer would be considered to be a financing rather
than a sale, the assets will remain on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet
with an offsetting liability recognized in the amount of proceeds received.

Second, a
determination must be made as to whether the securitization entity would be
included in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. For each
securitization entity with which it is involved, the Company makes a
determination of whether the entity should be considered a subsidiary of the
Company and be included in its Consolidated Financial Statements or whether the
entity is sufficiently independent that it does not need to be consolidated. If
the securitization entity s activities are sufficiently restricted to meet
accounting requirements to be a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), the
securitization entity is not consolidated by the seller of the   transferred assets. If the securitization
entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the
primary beneficiary.  

For all other
securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup
participates, a consolidation decision is made by evaluating several factors,
including how much of the entity s ownership is in the hands of third-party
investors, who controls the securitization entity, and who reaps the rewards and
bears the risks of the entity. Only securitization entities controlled by
Citigroup are consolidated.  

                Interests in the
securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated
interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts, and servicing
rights. In credit  

card securitizations,
the Company retains a seller s interest in the credit card receivables
transferred to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. Accordingly, the
seller s interest is carried on a historical cost basis and classified as
   Consumer loans   . Retained interests in securitized mortgage
loans and student loans are classified as    Trading account assets   , as is a majority of the retained interests in securitized credit card
receivables. Certain other retained interests are recorded as available-for-sale
investments, but servicing rights are recorded at fair value and included in
   Intangible assets   . Gains or losses on securitization and sale
depend in part on the previous carrying amount of the loans involved in the
transfer at the date of sale. Gains are recognized at the time of securitization
and are reported in    Other revenue.   

The Company values
its securitized retained interests at fair value using quoted market prices, if
such positions are actively traded, or financial models that incorporate
observable and unobservable inputs. More specifically, these models estimate the
fair value of these retained interests by determining the present value of
expected future cash flows, using modeling techniques that incorporate
management s best estimates of key assumptions, including prepayment speeds,
credit losses and discount rates, when observable inputs are not available. In
addition, internally calculated fair values of retained interests are compared
to recent sales of similar assets, if available.  

              Additional
information on the Company s securitization activities can be found in Note 23
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Debt  

        Short-term borrowings and long-term
debt are generally accounted for at amortized cost, except where the Company has
elected to report certain structured notes at fair value. 

Transfers of Financial
Assets  

        For a transfer of financial assets
to be considered a sale: the assets must have been isolated from the Company,
even in bankruptcy or other receivership; the purchaser must have the right to
sell the assets transferred or the purchaser must be a QSPE; and the Company may
not have an option or any obligation to reacquire the assets. If these sale
requirements are met, the assets are removed from the Company s Consolidated
Balance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is
considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, and the sale proceeds are recognized as the Company s liability.
A legal opinion on a sale is generally obtained for complex transactions or
where the Company   has continuing
involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity. For a
transfer to be eligible for sale accounting, those opinions must state that the
asset transfer is considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be
consolidated with the Company s    Other assets    in the
event of the Company s
insolvency.         See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion.  

Risk
Management Activities Derivatives Used for Non-Trading
Purposes     The
Company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside its trading
activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly or through
the use of derivative financial products, including interest-rate swaps,
futures, forwards, and purchased-option positions, as well as foreign-exchange
contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in    Other assets    or
   Other liabilities   .         To qualify as a hedge under the hedge
accounting rules, a derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the risk
designated as being hedged.  

132  

The hedge relationship
must be formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk
management objective and strategy for the hedge, which includes the item and
risk that is being hedged and the derivative that is being used, as well as how
effectiveness will be assessed and ineffectiveness measured. The effectiveness
of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective
basis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge
ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. If a hedge
relationship is found to be ineffective, it no longer qualifies as a hedge and
hedge accounting would not be applied. Any gains or losses attributable to the
derivatives, as well as subsequent changes in fair value, are recognized in
   Other revenue    with no offset on the hedged item, similar to
trading derivatives.         The foregoing criteria are applied on a
decentralized basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is managed,
but are subject to various limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability
or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar
items.         For fair value hedges, in which derivatives
hedge the fair value of assets or liabilities, changes in the fair value of
derivatives are reflected in    Other revenue   ,
together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged risk. These are
expected to, and generally do, offset each other. Any net amount, representing
hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in current earnings. Citigroup s fair value
hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt, and available-for-sale
securities.         For cash flow hedges, in which derivatives
hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating- and fixed-rate assets,
liabilities or forecasted transactions, the accounting treatment depends on the
effectiveness of the hedge. To the extent these derivatives are effective in
offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, the effective portion of
the changes in the derivatives  fair values will not be included in current
earnings, but are reported in    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   . These changes in fair value will be included
in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. To the
extent these derivatives are not effective, changes   in their
fair values are immediately included in   Other revenue    . Citigroup s cash flow hedges primarily
include hedges of floating- and fixed-rate debt, as well as rollovers of
short-term fixed-rate liabilities and floating-rate
liabilities.         For net investment hedges in which derivatives
hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation,
the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the
hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative,
including any forward premium or discount, is reflected in    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)    as part of the foreign currency translation
adjustment.         End-user derivatives that are economic hedges,
rather than qualifying for hedge accounting, are also carried at fair value,
with changes in value included in    Principal transactions    or    Other revenue   . Citigroup often uses economic hedges when
qualifying for hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally
burdensome; examples are hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans
and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in
other areas and may designate 

either a qualifying
hedge or an economic hedge, after considering the relative cost and benefits.
Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is
marked-to-market through current earnings, such as hedges of commitments to
originate one-to-four-family mortgage loans to be held-for-sale and mortgage
servicing rights (MSRs).         For those hedge relationships that are
terminated or when hedge designations are removed, the hedge accounting
treatment described in the paragraphs above is no longer applied. Instead, the
end-user derivative is terminated or transferred to the trading account. For
fair value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as
part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an
element of the yield. For cash flow hedges, any changes in fair value of the
end-user derivative remain in    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)    and are included in earnings of future
periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. However, if the hedged
forecasted transaction is no longer likely to occur, any changes in fair value
of the end-user derivative are immediately reflected in  Other revenue .  

Employee
Benefits Expense     Employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and
other postretirement benefit plans, which are accrued on a current basis,
contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the
amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits.

Stock-Based
Compensation  

          The Company recognizes
compensation expense related to stock and option awards over the requisite
service period based on the instruments  grant date fair value, reduced by
expected forfeitures. Compensation cost related to awards granted to employees
who meet certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement eligible
employees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant date, in the same manner as
the accrual for cash incentive compensation.  

Income
Taxes     The
Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and
municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company
operates. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by
the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a
provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and
interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. The
Company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will
affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and
foreign.  

             Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to
review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may
be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or
audit.         The Company implemented FASB Interpretation
No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in    Income Taxes     (FIN
48) (now ASC 740, Income Taxes), on January 1, 2007, which sets out a consistent
framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for
uncertain tax positions. See  Accounting
Changes.   

133  

The Company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component
of    Income tax expense   . 

               Deferred taxes are recorded for the
future consequences of events that have been recognized for financial statements
or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates.   Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to
management s judgment that realization is more likely than
not.         See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a further description of the Company s provision and related
income tax assets and liabilities.  

Commissions, Underwriting and Principal
Transactions     Commissions, underwriting and principal transactions revenues and related
expenses are recognized in income on a trade-date basis.  

Earnings
per Share     Earnings per share (EPS) is computed after deducting preferred-stock
dividends. The Company has granted restricted and deferred share awards that are
considered to be participating securities, which constitute a second class of
common stock. Accordingly, a portion of Citigroup s earnings is allocated to the
second class of common stock in the EPS
calculation.         Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of
dividends and undistributed earnings to the second class of common stock by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised. It is
computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of
the Company s stock options and warrants, convertible securities, T-DECs, and
the shares that could have been issued under the Company s Management Committee
Long-Term Incentive Plan and after the allocation of earnings to the second
class of common stock.  

Use of
Estimates     Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the
  Consolidated Financial Statements
and the related footnote disclosures. Such estimates are used in connection with
certain fair value measurements. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussions on estimates used in the determination of
fair value. The Company also uses estimates in determining consolidation
decisions for special-purpose entities as discussed in Note 23. Moreover,
estimates are significant in determining the amounts of other-than-temporary
impairments, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, provisions for
probable losses that may arise from credit-related exposures and probable and
estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, and tax
reserves. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results
could differ from those estimates. Current market conditions increase the risk
and complexity of the judgments in these estimates.  

Cash
Flows     Cash
equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks.
Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category
as the related assets and liabilities.  

Related
Party Transactions     The Company has related party transactions with certain of its
subsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term
in nature, include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin
accounts, derivative trading, charges for operational support and the borrowing
and lending of funds, and are entered into in the ordinary course of business.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES   

FASB
Launches Accounting Standards Codification     The FASB has issued FASB Statement No. 168,
The    FASB Accounting Standards
Codification      and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles  (now ASC 105,    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles   ). The statement establishes the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification  (Codification or ASC) as the single source of
authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by
the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive
releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of
federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
registrants. The   Codification   supersedes
all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other
nongrandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the   Codification   has become
nonauthoritative.        Following the   Codification  , the Board will not issue new standards in
the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force
Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates (ASU), which will
serve to update the  Codification ,
provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for
conclusions on the changes to the    Codification   .        GAAP is not intended to be changed as a result
of the FASB s  Codification  project, but
what does change is the way the guidance is organized and presented. As a
result, these changes have a significant impact on how companies reference GAAP
in their financial statements and in their accounting policies for financial
statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15,
2009.         Citigroup is providing references to the
   Codification    topics
alongside references to the predecessor standards. 

Investments
in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per
Share     As of
December 31, 2009, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2009-12,    Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate
Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)   , which provides guidance on measuring the
fair value of certain alternative investments. The ASU permits entities to use
net asset value as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of their
investments in certain investment funds. The ASU also requires additional
disclosures regarding the nature and risks of such investments and provides
guidance on the classification of such investments as Level 2 or Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy. This ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s
accounting for its investments in alternative investment
funds. 

Interim
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments     In
April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1,    Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments   , (now ASC
825-10-50-10,    Financial Instruments: Fair Value of Financial
Instruments   ). This FSP
requires disclosing qualitative and quantitative information about the fair
value of all financial instruments on a quarterly basis, including methods and
significant assumptions used to estimate fair value during the period. These
disclosures were previously only done
annually.         The disclosures required by this FSP were
effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. This FSP has no effect on how
Citigroup accounts for these instruments. 

Measurement
of Fair Value in Inactive Markets     In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-4,
   Determining Fair Value When the Volume and
Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly    (now ASC 820-10-35-51A,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Determining Fair Value When the
Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly
Decreased   ). The FSP
reaffirms that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The FSP
also reaffirms the need to use judgment in determining whether a formerly active
market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has
become inactive. The adoption of the FSP had no effect on the Company s
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Determining
Fair Value in Inactive Markets     In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS
157-3,    Determining Fair Value of Financial Assets
When the Market for That Asset is Not Active    (now ASC 820-10-35-55A,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Financial Assets in a Market
That is Not Active   ). The
FSP clarifies that companies can use internal assumptions to determine the fair
value of a financial asset when markets are inactive, and do not necessarily
have to rely on broker quotes. The FSP confirms a joint statement by the FASB
and the SEC in which they stated that companies can use internal assumptions
when relevant market information does not exist and provides an example of how
to determine the fair value for a financial asset in a non-active market. The
FASB emphasized that the FSP is not new guidance, but rather clarifies the
principles in ASC 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    (formerly SFAS
157).         Revisions resulting from a change in the
valuation technique or its application should be accounted for prospectively as
a change in accounting estimate.         The FSP was effective upon issuance and did
not have a material impact.  

135  

Measuring
Liabilities at Fair Value     As of September 30, 2009, the Company adopted
ASU No. 2009-05,    Measuring Liabilities at Fair
Value   . This ASU provides
clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market
for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to
measure fair value using one or more of the following
techniques:        A valuation technique that uses quoted prices
for similar liabilities (or an identical liability) when traded as
assets.        Another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of ASC
820. This ASU also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for
the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the
identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no
adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required, are Level 1 fair
value measurements.         This ASU did not have a material impact on the
Company s fair value measurements. 

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Investment
Securities     In
April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2,    Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments    (FSP FAS
115-2) (now ASC 320-10-35-34,    Investments Debt and Equity Securities: Recognition of an
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment   ), which amends the recognition guidance for other-than-temporary
impairments (OTTI) of debt securities and expands the financial statement
disclosures for OTTI on debt and equity securities. Citigroup adopted the FSP in
the first quarter of 2009.         As a result of the FSP, the Company s
Consolidated Statement of Income reflects the full impairment (that is, the
difference between the security s amortized cost basis and fair value) on debt
securities that the Company intends to sell or would more-likely-than-not be
required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. For
available-for- sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities that
management has no intent to sell and believes that it more-likely-than-not will
not be required to sell prior to recovery, only the credit loss component of the
impairment is recognized in earnings, while the rest of the fair value loss is
recognized in    Accumulated other comprehensive
income    (AOCI). The credit
loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal
cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security
as projected using the Company s cash flow projections and its base assumptions.
As a result of the adoption of the FSP, Citigroup s income in the first quarter
of 2009 was higher by $631 million on a pretax basis ($391 million on an
after-tax basis), respectively, and AOCI was decreased by a corresponding
amount.         The cumulative effect of the change included
an increase in the opening balance of    Retained earnings   
at January 1, 2009 of $665 million on a pretax basis ($413 million after-tax).
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to
the Company s investment securities and OTTI. 

Business
Combinations     In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(revised),    Business Combinations    (now ASC 805-10,    Business Combinations   ), which is designed to improve the relevance, representational
faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity
provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
The statement retains the fundamental principle that the acquisition method of
accounting (which was called the    purchase method   ) be
used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each
business combination. The statement also retains the guidance for identifying
and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. The most significant
changes are: (1) acquisition costs and restructuring costs will now be expensed;
(2) stock consideration will be measured based on the quoted market price as of
the acquisition date instead of the date the deal is announced; (3) contingent
consideration arising from contractual and noncontractual contingencies that
meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will be measured and
recognized as an asset or liability at fair value at the acquisition date using
a probability-weighted discounted cash flows model, with subsequent changes in
fair value reflected in earnings; noncontractual contingencies that do not meet
the more-likely-than-not criteria will continue to be recognized when they are
probable and reasonably estimable; and (4) the acquirer will record a 100%
step-up to fair value for all assets and liabilities, including the minority
interest portion, and goodwill is recorded as if a 100% interest was
acquired.         Citigroup adopted the standard on January 1,
2009, and it is applied prospectively.  

Noncontrolling Interests in
Subsidiaries     In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements    (now ASC
810-10-45-15,    Consolidation Noncontrolling Interests in a
Subsidiary   ), which
establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling
interests in subsidiaries (previously called minority interests) in consolidated
financial statements and for the loss of control of subsidiaries. The Standard
requires that the equity interest of noncontrolling shareholders, partners, or
other equity holders in subsidiaries be presented as a separate item in
   Citigroup s stockholders 
equity   , rather than as a
liability. After the initial adoption, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any
retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be
measured at fair value at the date of
deconsolidation.         The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the
subsidiary is measured using the fair value of the remaining investment, rather
than the previous carrying amount of that retained
investment.         Citigroup adopted the Standard on January 1,
2009. As a result, $2.392 billion of noncontrolling interests was reclassified
from    Other liabilities    to  Citigroup s     stockholders  equity   . 

136  

Sale with
Repurchase Financing Agreements     In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position (FSP) FAS 140-3,    Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase Financing
Transactions    (now ASC
860-10-40-42,    Transfers and Servicing: Repurchase
Financing   ). This FSP
provides implementation guidance on whether a security transfer with a
contemporaneous repurchase financing involving the transferred financial asset
must be evaluated as one linked transaction or two separate de-linked
transactions.         The FSP requires the recognition of the
transfer and the repurchase agreement as one linked transaction, unless all of
the following criteria are met: (1) the initial transfer and the repurchase
financing are not contractually contingent on one another; (2) the initial
transferor has full recourse upon default, and the repurchase agreement s price
is fixed and not at fair value; (3) the financial asset is readily obtainable in
the marketplace and the transfer and repurchase financing are executed at market
rates; and (4) the maturity of the repurchase financing is before the maturity
of the financial asset. The scope of this FSP is limited to transfers and
subsequent repurchase financings that are entered into contemporaneously or in
contemplation of one
another.         Citigroup adopted the FSP on January 1, 2009.
The impact of adopting this FSP was not material.  

Enhanced
Disclosures of Credit Derivative Instruments and
Guarantees     In
September 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4,    Disclosures About Credit Derivatives and
Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB
Interpretation No. 45, and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement
No. 161  (now ASC 815-10-50-4K,    Derivatives and Hedging: Credit Derivatives   ) which requires additional disclosures for
sellers of credit derivative instruments and certain guarantees. This FSP
requires the disclosure of the maximum potential amount of future payments, the
related fair value, and the current status of the payment/performance risk for
certain guarantees and credit derivatives sold.  

Measurement
of Impairment for Certain Securities     In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF
99-20-1,  Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue 99-20  (now
incorporated into ASC 320-10-35-20,    Investments Debt and Equity Securities: Steps for Identifying and
Accounting for Impairment   ), to achieve more consistent determination of whether
other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt
securities have occurred.         Prior guidance required entities to assess
whether it was probable that the holder would be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms. The FSP eliminates the requirement to
consider market participants  views of cash flows of a security in determining
whether or not impairment has
occurred.         The FSP is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008 and is applied prospectively.
The impact of adopting this FSP was not material.  

SEC Staff
Guidance on Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through
Earnings     On
January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 (SAB
109), which requires that the fair value of a written loan commitment that is
marked-to-market through earnings should include the future cash flows related
to the loan s servicing rights. However, the fair value measurement of a written
loan commitment still must exclude the expected net cash flows related to
internally developed intangible assets (such as customer relationship intangible
assets). SAB 109 applies to two types of loan commitments: (1) written mortgage
loan commitments for loans that will be held-for-sale when funded and are
marked-to-market as derivatives; and (2) other written loan commitments that are
accounted for at fair value through earnings under the fair value option. SAB
109 supersedes SAB 105, which applied only to derivative loan commitments and
allowed the expected future cash flows related to the associated servicing of
the loan to be recognized only after the servicing asset had been contractually
separated from the underlying loan by sale or securitization of the loan with
servicing retained. SAB 109 was applied prospectively to loan commitments issued
or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. The impact of
adopting this SAB was not material.  

Netting of
Cash Collateral Against Derivative Exposures     During April 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN
39-1,  Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39  (now incorporated into ASC
815-10-45,    Derivatives and Hedging Other Presentation
Matters   ) modifying certain
provisions of FIN 39,  Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.  This
amendment clarified the acceptability of the existing market practice of
offsetting the amounts recorded for cash collateral receivables or payables
against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed
with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement, which was
the Company s prior accounting practice. Thus, this amendment did not affect the
Company s consolidated financial statements.  

137  

Fair Value
Measurements     The
Company elected to early adopt SFAS No. 157,    Fair Value Measurements    (SFAS 157) (now ASC 820-10,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ), as of January 1, 2007. The Statement
defines fair value, expands disclosure requirements around fair value and
specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to
those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs
reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
reflect the Company s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the
following fair value hierarchy:  

Level 1: Quoted prices for
     identical    instruments in active markets. 
           
          Level 2: Quoted prices for
     similar    instruments in active markets; quoted 
   prices for identical or similar
  instruments in markets that are not   active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs
  and   significant value drivers
  are observable in active markets. 
           
          Level 3: Valuations derived from
  valuation techniques in which one or   more significant inputs or significant value drivers are
  unobservable.   
       
             This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when
available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair
value. For some products or in certain market conditions, observable inputs may
not always be available. For example, during the market dislocations that
started in the second half of 2007, certain markets became illiquid, and some
key observable inputs used in valuing certain exposures were unavailable. When
and if these markets become liquid, the valuation of these exposures will use
the related observable inputs available at that time from these
markets.         Citigroup is required to take into account its
own credit risk when measuring the fair value of derivative positions as well as
the other liabilities for which fair value accounting has been elected. The
adoption of ASC 820 also resulted in some other changes to the valuation
techniques used by Citigroup when determining fair value, most notably the
changes to the way that the probability of default of a counterparty is factored
in and the elimination of a derivative valuation adjustment which is no longer
necessary. The cumulative effect at January 1, 2007 of making these changes was
a gain of $250 million after-tax ($402 million pretax), or $0.05 per diluted
share, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2007 earnings within the
   Securities and Banking   
business.        The statement also precludes the use of block
discounts for instruments traded in an active market, which were previously
applied to large holdings of publicly traded equity securities, and requires the
recognition of trade-date gains after consideration of all appropriate valuation
adjustments related to certain derivative trades that use unobservable inputs in
determining their fair value. Previous accounting guidance allowed the use of
block discounts in certain circumstances and prohibited the recognition of
day-one gains on certain derivative trades when determining the fair value of
instruments not traded in an active market. The cumulative effect of these
changes resulted in an increase to January 1, 2007    Retained earnings   
of $75 million.  

Fair Value
Option     The
Company also early adopted SFAS 159,    The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities    (SFAS 159)
(now ASC 825-10-05,    Financial Instruments: Fair Value Option   ) as of January 1, 2007. The fair value option
provides an option on an instrument-by-instrument basis for most financial
assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value with changes in fair value
reported in earnings. After the initial adoption, the election is made at the
acquisition of a financial asset, a financial liability, or a firm commitment
and it may not be revoked. The fair value option provides an opportunity to
mitigate volatility in reported earnings that resulted prior to its adoption
from being required to apply fair value accounting to certain economic hedges
(e.g., derivatives) while having to measure the assets and liabilities being
economically hedged using an accounting method other than fair
value.         The Company elected to apply fair value
accounting to certain financial instruments held at January 1, 2007 with future
changes in value reported in earnings. The adoption of the fair value option
resulted in a decrease to January 1, 2007    Retained earnings    of $99 million.  

Leveraged
Leases     On
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP FAS 13-2,    Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows
Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leverage Lease
Transaction    (FSP 13-2)
(now incorporated into ASC 840-10-25, Leases), which provides guidance regarding
changes or projected changes in the timing of cash flows relating to income
taxes generated by a leveraged-lease
transaction.         Leveraged leases can provide significant tax
benefits to the lessor, primarily as a result of the timing of tax payments.
Since changes in the timing and/or amount of these tax benefits may have a
significant effect on the cash flows of a lease transaction, a lessor will be
required to perform a recalculation of a leveraged-lease when there is a change
or projected change in the timing of the realization of tax benefits generated
by that lease. Previously, Citigroup did not recalculate the tax benefits if
only the timing of cash flows had
changed.         The adoption of FSP 13-2 resulted in a
decrease to January 1, 2007    Retained earnings   
of $148 million. This decrease to retained earnings will be recognized in
earnings over the remaining lives of the leases as tax benefits are realized.

138  

Revisions
to the Earnings-per-Share Calculation     In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1,
 Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are
Participating Securities  (now incorporated into ASC 260-10-45-59A,    Earnings Per Share: Participating Securities and the Two-Class
Method   ). Under the FSP,
unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to
dividends are considered to be a separate class of common stock and included in
the EPS calculation using the  two-class method.  Citigroup s restricted and
deferred share awards meet the definition of a participating security. In
accordance with the FSP, restricted and deferred shares are now included as a
separate class of common stock in the basic and diluted EPS
calculation.        The following table shows the effect of
adopting the FSP on Citigroup s basic and diluted EPS: 

(1)         
             
                Diluted EPS
      is the same as Basic EPS in 2009 and 2008 due to the net loss available to
      common shareholders. Using actual diluted shares would result in
      anti-dilution.  

N/A Not
      applicable 

Fair Value
Disclosures About Pension Plan Assets     In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS
132(R)-1,    Employers  Disclosures about Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets    (now incorporated into ASC 715-20-50,
   Compensation and
Benefits Disclosure   ). This
FSP requires that more detailed information about plan assets be disclosed on an
annual basis. Citigroup is required to separate plan assets into the three fair
value hierarchy levels and provide a roll-forward of the changes in fair value
of plan assets classified as Level
3.        The disclosures about plan assets required by this FSP are effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, but have no effect on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Income.  

Additional
Disclosures for Derivative Instruments     In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
   Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, an Amendment to SFAS 133    (now incorporated into ASC 815-10-50,
   Derivatives and
Hedging Disclosure   ). The
Standard requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedged
items that are accounted for under ASC 815 related interpretations. The Standard
is effective for all of the Company s interim and annual financial statements
beginning with the first quarter of 2009. The Standard expands the disclosure
requirements for derivatives and hedged items and has no impact on how Citigroup
accounts for these instruments.  

Determining
Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity s Own
Stock     Derivative
contracts on a company s own stock may be accounted for as equity instruments,
rather than as assets and liabilities, only if they are both indexed solely to
the company s stock and settleable in shares.
        In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on
Issue 07-5,  Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed
to an Entity s Own Stock  (Issue 07-5) (now ASC 815-40-15-5,    Derivatives and Hedging: Evaluating Whether an Instrument is Considered
Indexed to an Entity s Own Stock   ). An instrument (or embedded feature) would not be considered indexed to
an entity s own stock if its settlement amount is affected by variables other
than those used to determine the fair value of a  plain vanilla  option or
forward contract on equity shares, or if the instrument contains a feature (such
as a leverage factor) that increases exposure to those variables. An
equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) would not be considered
indexed to the entity s own stock if the strike price is denominated in a
currency other than the issuer s functional currency.           This issue is effective for Citigroup on
January 1, 2009 and did not have a material impact.  

Equity
Method Investment Accounting Considerations     In November 2008, the FASB ratified the
consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 08-6,  Equity Method Investment
Accounting Considerations  (Issue 08-6) (now ASC 323-10,    Investments   Equity Method and
Joint Ventures   ). An entity
shall measure its equity method investment initially at cost. Any
other-than-temporary impairment of an equity method investment should be
recognized in accordance with Opinion 18. An equity method investor shall not
separately test an investee s underlying assets for impairment. Share issuance
by an investee shall be accounted for as if the equity method investor had sold
a proportionate share of its investment, with gain or loss recognized in
earnings.           This issue is effective for Citigroup on
January 1, 2009, and did not have a material impact.  

139  

Accounting
for Defensive Intangible Assets     In November 2008, the FASB ratified the
consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 08-7,  Accounting for Defensive
Intangible Assets  (Issue 08-7) (now ASC 350-30-25-5,    Intangibles   Goodwill and Other: Defensive Intangible
Assets   ). An acquired
defensive asset shall be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting (i.e.,
an asset separate from other assets of the acquirer). The useful life assigned
to an acquired defensive asset shall be based on the period during which the
asset would diminish in value. Issue 08-7 states that it would be rare for a
defensive intangible asset to have an indefinite life. Issue 08-7 is effective
for Citigroup on January 1, 2009, and did not have a material impact.

CVA
Accounting Misstatement     The Company determined that an error existed in the process used to value
certain liabilities for which the Company elected the fair value option (FVO).
The error related to a calculation intended to measure the impact on the
liability s fair value attributable to Citigroup s credit spreads. Because of
the error in the process, both an initial Citi contractual credit spread and an
initial own-credit valuation adjustment were being included at the time of
issuance of new Citi FVO debt. The own-credit valuation adjustment was properly
included; therefore, the initial Citi contractual credit spread should have been
excluded. (See Note 27 for a description of own-credit valuation adjustments.)
The cumulative effect of this error from January 1, 2007 (the date that FAS 157
(ASC 820), requiring the valuation of own-credit for FVO liabilities, was
adopted) through December 31, 2008 was to overstate income and retained earnings
by $204 million ($330 million on a pretax basis). The impact of this adjustment
was determined not to be material to the Company s results of operations and
financial position for any previously reported period. Consequently, in the
accompanying financial statements, the cumulative effect through December 31,
2008 is recorded in 2009.  

The table below summarizes the previously reported impact of CVA income
for debt on which the FVO was elected and the related adjustments to correct the
process error for the impacted reporting periods.

the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS  

Additional
Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements     In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06,
   Improving Disclosures about Fair Value
Measurements.    The ASU
requires disclosing the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1
and 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers. The
disclosures are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2009. Additionally, disclosures of the gross purchases, sales, issuances and
settlements activity in Level 3 fair value measurements will be required for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.  

Elimination of QSPEs and Changes in the        Consolidation Model for Variable Interest
Entities     In June
2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166,    Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 140    (SFAS
166), that will eliminate Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs). SFAS 166
is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2009. This change
will have a significant impact on Citigroup s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Beginning January 1, 2010, the Company will lose sales treatment for certain
future asset transfers that would have been considered sales under SFAS 140, and
for certain transfers of portions of assets that do not meet the definition of
participating interests.        Simultaneously, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,
   Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)
   (SFAS 167), which details
three key changes to the consolidation model. First, former QSPEs will now be
included in the scope of SFAS 167. In addition, the FASB has changed the method
of analyzing which party to a variable interest entity (VIE) should consolidate
the VIE (known as the primary beneficiary) to a qualitative determination of
which party to the VIE has  power  combined with potentially significant
benefits or losses, instead of the current quantitative risks and rewards model.
The entity that has power has the ability to direct the activities of the VIE
that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. Finally, the new
standard requires that the primary beneficiary analysis be re-evaluated whenever
circumstances change. The current rules require reconsideration of the primary
beneficiary only when specified reconsideration events occur.          As a result of implementing these
new accounting standards, Citigroup will consolidate certain of the VIEs and
former QSPEs with which it currently has involvement. An ongoing evaluation of
the application of these new requirements could, with the resolution of certain
uncertainties, result in the identification of additional VIEs and former QSPEs,
other than those presented below, needing to be consolidated. It is not
currently anticipated, however, that any such newly identified VIEs and former
QSPEs would have a significant impact on Citigroup s Consolidated Financial
Statements or capital position.          In accordance with SFAS
167, Citigroup employed three approaches for consolidating all of the VIEs and
former QSPEs that it consolidated as of January 1, 2010. The first approach
requires initially measuring the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling
interests of the VIEs and former QSPEs at their carrying values (the amounts at
which the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests would have been
carried in the Consolidated  

Financial Statements, if
Citigroup had always consolidated these VIEs and former QSPEs). The second
approach is to use the unpaid principal amounts, where using carrying values is
not practicable. The third approach is to elect the fair value option, in which
all of the financial assets and liabilities of certain designated VIEs and
former QSPEs would be recorded at fair value upon adoption of SFAS 167 and
continue to be marked to market thereafter, with changes in fair value reported
in earnings.          Citigroup consolidated all required
VIEs and former QSPEs, as of January 1, 2010 at carrying values or unpaid
principal amounts, except for certain private label residential mortgage and
mutual fund deferred sales commissions VIEs, for which the fair value option was
elected. The following tables present the pro forma impact of adopting these new
accounting standards applying these approaches.          The pro forma impact of these
changes on incremental GAAP assets and resulting risk-weighted assets for those
VIEs and former QSPEs that were consolidated or deconsolidated for accounting
purposes as of January 1, 2010 (based on financial information as of December
31, 2009), reflecting Citigroup s present understanding of the new accounting
requirements and immediate implementation of the recently issued final
risk-based capital rules regarding SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, was as
follows: 

(1)         
              Citigroup
      undertook certain actions during the first and second quarters of 2009 in
      support of its off-balance-sheet credit card securitization vehicles. As a
      result of these actions, Citigroup included approximately $82 billion of
      incremental risk-weighted assets in its risk-based capital ratios as of
      March 31, 2009 and an additional approximate $900 million as of June 30,
      2009. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements.  
            
              (2)  
              The
      implementation of SFAS 167 will result in the deconsolidation of certain
      synthetic and cash collateralized debt obligation (CDO) VIEs that were
      previously consolidated under the requirements of ASC 810 (FIN 46(R)).
      Upon deconsolidation of these synthetic CDOs, Citigroup s Consolidated
      Balance Sheet will reflect the recognition of current receivables and
      payables related to purchased and written credit default swaps entered
      into with these VIEs, which had previously been eliminated in
      consolidation. The deconsolidation of certain cash CDOs will have a
      minimal impact on GAAP assets, but will cause a sizable increase in
      risk-weighted assets. The impact on risk-weighted assets results from
      replacing, in Citigroup s trading account, largely investment grade
      securities owned by these VIEs when consolidated, with Citigroup s
      holdings of non-investment grade or unrated securities issued by these
      VIEs when deconsolidated.  
            
              (3)  
              Certain
      equity-linked note client intermediation transactions that had previously
      been consolidated under the requirements of ASC 810 (FIN 46 (R)) will be
      deconsolidated with the implementation of SFAS 167. Upon deconsolidation,
      Citigroup s Consolidated Balance Sheet will reflect both the equity-linked
      notes issued by the VIEs and held by Citigroup as trading assets, as well
      as related trading liabilities in the form of prepaid equity derivatives.
      These trading assets and trading liabilities were formerly eliminated in
      consolidation.  

141  

The preceding table reflects: (i) the
estimated portion of the assets of former QSPEs to which Citigroup, acting as
principal, had transferred assets and received sales treatment as of December
31, 2009 (totaling approximately $712.0 billion), and (ii) the estimated assets
of significant unconsolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2009 with which Citigroup
is involved (totaling approximately $219.2 billion) that are required to be
consolidated under the new accounting standards. Due to the variety of
transaction structures and the level of Citigroup involvement in individual
former QSPEs and VIEs, only a portion of the former QSPEs and VIEs with which
the Company is involved are to be consolidated.            In addition, the cumulative effect of adopting
these new accounting standards as of January 1, 2010, based on financial
information as of December 31, 2009, would result in an estimated aggregate
after-tax charge to    Retained earnings    of approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting the net effect of an overall
pretax charge to    Retained earnings    (primarily relating to the establishment of
loan loss reserves and the reversal of residual interests held) of approximately
$13.4 billion and the recognition of related deferred tax assets amounting to
approximately $5.1 billion.          The pro forma impact on
certain of Citigroup s regulatory capital ratios of adopting these new
accounting standards (based on financial information as of December 31, 2009),
reflecting immediate implementation of the recently issued final risk-based
capital rules regarding SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, would be as follows: 

The actual impact of
adopting the new accounting standards on January 1, 2010 could differ, as
financial information changes from the December 31, 2009 estimates and as
several uncertainties in the application of these new standards are
resolved.            Among these uncertainties, the FASB has
proposed an indefinite deferral of the requirements of SFAS 167 for certain
investment companies. Without the proposed deferral, the Company had most
recently estimated that approximately $3.3 billion of assets held by investment
funds managed by Citigroup would be newly consolidated upon the adoption of SFAS
167. If the proposed deferral were to be finalized as currently contemplated,
the Company expects that many, if not all, of the investment vehicles managed by
Citigroup would not be subject to the requirements of SFAS 167. Nevertheless,
Citigroup is continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of the proposed
requirements and, depending upon the eventual resolution of specific
implementation matters, may be required to consolidate certain investment
vehicles, the aggregate assets of which could range up to a total of
approximately $1.2 billion. The effect on the Company s regulatory capital
ratios, should consolidation of any or all such noted investment vehicles be
required, is not expected to be significant. The preceding tables reflect the
Company s view that none of the investment vehicles managed by Citigroup will be
required to be consolidated under SFAS 167. 

Loss-Contingency
Disclosures      In June 2008, the FASB issued an
exposure draft proposing expanded disclosures regarding loss contingencies. This
proposal increases the number of loss contingencies subject to disclosure and
requires substantial quantitative and qualitative information to be provided
about those loss contingencies. The proposal will have no impact on the
Company s accounting for loss contingencies.   

Investment
Company Audit Guide (SOP 07-1)     In July 2007, the AICPA issued Statement of
Position 07-1,  Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide for
Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method
Investors for Investments in Investment Companies  (SOP 07-1) (now incorporated
into ASC 946-10,    Financial Services-Investment
Companies   ), which was
expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15,
2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date
indefinitely by issuing an FSP SOP 07-1-1,  Effective Date of AICPA Statement of
Position 07-1.  This statement sets forth more stringent criteria for qualifying
as an investment company than does the predecessor Audit Guide. In addition, ASC
946-10 (SOP 07-1) establishes new criteria for a parent company or equity method
investor to retain investment company accounting in their consolidated financial
statements. Investment companies record all their investments at fair value with
changes in value reflected in earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the
potential impact of adopting the SOP.

2. BUSINESS
DEVELOPMENTS  

ACQUISITIONS   

North
America   

Acquisition
of ABN AMRO Mortgage Group     In 2007, Citigroup acquired ABN AMRO Mortgage
Group (AAMG), a subsidiary of LaSalle Bank Corporation and ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
AAMG is a national originator and servicer of prime residential mortgage loans.
As part of this acquisition, Citigroup purchased approximately $12 billion in
assets, including $3 billion of mortgage servicing rights, which resulted in the
addition of approximately 1.5 million servicing customers. Results for AAMG are
included within Citigroup s    North America Regional Consumer Banking    business from March 1, 2007 forward.

Acquisition
of Old Lane Partners, L.P.     In 2007, the Company completed the acquisition
of Old Lane Partners, L.P. and Old Lane Partners, GP, LLC (Old Lane). Old Lane
is the manager of a global, multistrategy hedge fund and a private equity fund.
Results for Old Lane are included within    ICG,    from July 2,
2007 forward.        On June 12, 2008, Citigroup announced the
restructuring of Old Lane and its multistrategy hedge fund (the  Fund ) in
anticipation of redemptions by all unaffiliated, non-Citigroup employee
investors. To accomplish this restructuring, Citigroup purchased substantially
all of the assets of the Fund at fair value on June 30, 2008. The fair value of
assets purchased from the Fund was approximately $6 billion at June 30, 2008.

Acquisition
of BISYS     In
2007, the Company completed its acquisition of BISYS Group, Inc. (BISYS) for
$1.47 billion in cash. In addition, BISYS s shareholders received $18.2 million
in the form of a special dividend paid by BISYS simultaneously. Citigroup
completed the sale of the Retirement and Insurance Services Divisions of BISYS
to affiliates of J.C. Flowers   Co. LLC, making the net cost of the
transaction to Citigroup approximately $800 million. Citigroup retained the Fund
Services and Alternative Investment Services businesses of BISYS, which provides
administrative services for hedge funds, mutual funds and private equity funds.
Results for BISYS are included within    Transaction Services    business from August 1, 2007 forward.  

Acquisition
of Automated Trading Desk     In 2007, Citigroup completed its acquisition
of Automated Trading Desk (ATD), a leader in electronic market making and

8. INCENTIVE PLANS  

        The Company has adopted a number of
equity compensation plans under which it administers stock options, restricted
or deferred stock awards, stock payments and stock purchase programs. The
award programs are used to attract, retain and motivate officers, employees and
non-employee directors, to provide incentives for their contributions to the
long-term performance and growth of the Company, and to align their interests
with those of stockholders. The plans are administered by the Personnel and
Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors (the Committee),
which is composed entirely of independent non-employee directors. Since April
19, 2005, all equity awards have been pursuant to stockholder-approved
plans.        At December 31, 2009, approximately 580.33 million shares were authorized
and available for grant under Citigroup s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, and
approximately 66.45 million shares were available for purchase under Citigroup s
2000 Stock Purchase Plan. The final purchase date for the last offering under
the stock purchase plan was in 2005 and the plan will expire by its terms on
April 30, 2010. Citigroup s general practice is to deliver shares from treasury
stock upon the exercise or vesting of equity
awards.        The following table shows components of compensation expense relating to
the Company s stock-based compensation programs as recorded during 2009, 2008
and 2007: 

(1)  
                       
              Management Committee Long-Term Incentive Plan (MC LTIP) awards were
      granted in 2007. The awards expired in December 2009 without the issuance
      of shares.  
            
              (2)  
                 
              Represents amortization of expense over the remaining life of all
      unvested restricted and deferred stock awards granted to all employees
      prior to 2006. The 2009, 2008 and 2007 periods also include amortization
      expense for all unvested awards to non-retirement-eligible employees on or
      after January 1, 2006. Amortization includes estimated forfeitures of
      awards.  

150  

Stock Award
Programs     Citigroup issues (and has issued) shares of its common stock in the form
of restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards, and stock payments pursuant
to the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (and predecessor plans) to its officers,
employees and non-employee
directors.         Citigroup s primary stock award program is the
Capital Accumulation Program (CAP). Generally, CAP awards of restricted or
deferred stock constitute a percentage of annual incentive compensation and vest
ratably over four-year periods, beginning on the first anniversary of the award
date.         Continuous employment within Citigroup is
generally required to vest in CAP and other stock award programs. Typically,
full or partial vesting is provided for participants whose employment is
terminated involuntarily during the vesting period for a reason other than
 gross misconduct,  who meet specified age and service requirements
(retirement-eligible participants), or who die or become disabled during the
vesting period. Post-employment vesting by retirement-eligible participants is
generally conditioned upon their refraining from competing with Citigroup during
the remaining vesting period.        Generally, in order to reduce the use of
shares under Citigroup s stockholder-approved stock incentive plan,
the percentages of total annual incentives awarded pursuant to CAP in 2009 and
2010 were reduced and were instead awarded as deferred cash awards in the U.S.
and the U.K. The deferred cash awards are subject to two-year and four-year
vesting schedules, but the other terms and conditions are the same as CAP
awards. The deferred cash awards earn a return during the vesting period based
on LIBOR; in 2010 only, a portion of the deferred cash award was denominated as
a stock unit, the value of which will fluctuate based on the price of Citi
common stock. In both cases, only cash will be delivered at
vesting.         In 2009 and prior years, CAP awards were
granted to Smith Barney financial advisors and employees of certain other
businesses with two-year vesting schedules (FA
CAP).         From 2003 to 2007, Citigroup granted annual
stock awards under its Citigroup Ownership Program (COP) to a broad base of
employees who were not eligible for CAP. The COP awards of restricted or
deferred stock vest after three years, but otherwise have terms similar to
CAP.         Non-employee directors receive part of their
compensation in the form of deferred stock awards that vest in two years, and
may elect to receive part of their retainer in the form of a stock payment,
which they may elect to defer.        From time to time, restricted or deferred
stock awards are made to induce talented employees to join Citigroup or as
special retention awards to key employees. Vesting periods vary, but are
generally two to four years. Generally, recipients must remain employed through
the vesting dates to receive the shares awarded, except in cases of death,
disability, or involuntary termination other than for  gross misconduct.  Unlike
CAP, these awards do not usually provide for post-employment vesting by
retirement-eligible participants.  

For all stock awards, during the applicable vesting period, the shares
awarded are not issued to participants (in the case of a deferred stock award)
or cannot be sold or transferred by the participants (in the case of a
restricted stock award), until after the vesting conditions have been satisfied.
Recipients of deferred stock awards do not have any stockholder rights until
shares are delivered to them, but they generally are entitled to receive
dividend-equivalent payments during the vesting period. Recipients of restricted
stock awards are entitled to a limited voting right and to receive dividend
equivalent payments during the vesting period. Once a stock award vests, the
shares become freely transferable (but certain executives are required to hold
the shares subject to a stock ownership
commitment).         Compensation
in respect of 2009 performance to certain officers and highly-compensated
employees (other than the CEO, who received no incentive compensation) was
administered pursuant to structures approved by the Special Master for TARP
Executive Compensation (Special Master). Pursuant to such structures, the
affected employees did not participate in CAP and instead received equity
compensation in the form of salary stock payments (which become transferrable in
monthly installments over periods of either one year or three years beginning in
January 2010), and incentive awards in the form of fully-vested stock payments,
long-term restricted stock (LTRS) and other restricted and deferred stock awards
subject to vesting requirements and sale restrictions. The LTRS awards generally
will not vest unless the employee remains employed until January 20, 2013, and
vested shares will become transferable only in 25% installments as each 25%
of Citi s TARP obligations is repaid. The awards are also subject to
clawback provisions. Similar to CAP awards, the LTRS awards will vest in the
event of the recipient s death or disability,  but vesting upon
retirement or a change in control are not provided.  The other restricted
and deferred stock awards vest ratably over three years pursuant to terms
similar to CAP awards, but vested shares are subject to sale restrictions until
the later of the first anniversary of the regularly scheduled vesting date, or
January 20, 2013.          Unearned compensation expense associated with the CAP, COP and the other
restricted and deferred stock awards described above represents the market value
of Citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to
income ratably over the vesting period, except for those awards granted to
retirement-eligible employees. The charge to income for awards made to
retirement-eligible employees is accelerated based on the dates the retirement
rules are met. Beginning in 2006, stock awards to retirement-eligible employees
are recognized in the year prior to the grant in the same manner as cash
incentive compensation is accrued.        In connection with its agreement to repay $20
billion of its TARP obligations to the U.S. Treasury Department in December
2009, Citigroup announced that $1.7 billion of incentive compensation that would
have otherwise been awarded in cash to employees in respect of 2009 performance
would instead be awarded as  common stock equivalent  (CSE) awards. CSE awards
are denominated in U.S. dollars or in local currency and will be paid in April
2010. CSEs are subject to forfeiture only if employment is terminated for reason
of  gross misconduct  on or prior to the payment date. If stockholders approve
in April 2010, the CSEs will be paid in fully transferable 

151  

shares of Citigroup
common stock. The number of shares to be delivered will equal the CSE award
value divided by the then fair market value of the common stock. For CSEs
awarded to certain employees whose compensation structure was approved by
the Special Master, 50% of the shares to be delivered in April 2010 will be
subject to restrictions on sale and transfer until January 20, 2011. In lieu of
2010 CAP awards, certain retirement-eligible employees were instead awarded CSEs
payable in April 2010, but any shares that are to be delivered in April 2010
(subject to stockholder approval) will be subject to restrictions on sale or
transfer that will lapse in four equal annual installments beginning January 20,
2011. CSE awards have generally been accrued as compensation expenses in the
year 2009 and will be recorded as a liability from the January 2010 grant date
until the settlement date in April 2010. If stockholders approve delivery of
Citigroup stock for the CSE awards, CSE awards will likely be paid as new issues
of common stock as an exception to the Company s practice of delivering shares
from treasury stock, and the recorded liability will be reclassified as equity
at that time.        In January 2009, members of the Management
Executive Committee (except the CEO and CFO) received 30% of their incentive
awards for 2008 as performance vesting-equity awards. These awards vest 50% if
the price of Citigroup common stock meets a price target of $10.61, and 50% for
a price target of $17.85, in each case on or prior to January 14, 2013. The
price target will be met only if the NYSE closing price equals or exceeds the
applicable price target for at least 20 NYSE trading days within any period of
30 consecutive NYSE trading days ending on or before January 14, 2013. Any
shares that have not vested by such date will vest according to a fraction, the
numerator of which is the share price on the delivery date and the denominator
of which is the price target of the unvested shares. No dividend equivalents are
paid on unvested awards. Fair value of the awards is recognized as compensation
expense ratably over the vesting period. 

On July 17, 2007, the Committee approved the Management Committee
Long-Term Incentive Plan (MC LTIP) (pursuant to the terms of the
shareholder-approved 1999 Stock Incentive Plan) under which participants
received an equity award that could be earned based on Citigroup s performance
against various metrics relative to peer companies and publicly-stated return on
equity (ROE) targets measured at the end of each calendar year beginning with
2007. The final expense for each of the three consecutive calendar years was
adjusted based on the results of the ROE tests. No awards were earned for 2009,
2008 or 2007 and no shares were issued because performance targets were not met.
No new awards were made under the MC LTIP since the initial award in July
2007.         CAP participants in 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
and FA CAP participants in those years and in 2009, could elect to receive all
or part of their award in stock options. The figures presented in the stock
option program tables (see  Stock Option Programs  below) include options
granted in lieu of CAP and FA CAP stock awards in those
years.         A summary of the status of Citigroup s
unvested stock awards at December 31, 2009 and changes during the 12 months
ended December 31, 2009 are presented below: 

(1)  

The
      weighted-average market value of the vestings during 2009 was
      approximately $3.64 per share.  

At December 31, 2009, there was $1.6 billion of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested stock awards net of the forfeiture
provision. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 1.3 years.  

152  

Stock Option
Programs    The Company
has a number of stock option programs for its non-employee directors, officers
and employees. Generally, in January 2008, 2007 and 2006, stock options were
granted only to CAP and FA CAP participants who elected to receive stock options
in lieu of restricted or deferred stock awards, and to non-employee directors
who elected to receive their compensation in the form of a stock option grant.
Beginning in 2009, CAP participants, and directors may no longer elect to
receive stock options. Occasionally, stock options also may be granted as
sign-on awards. All stock options are granted on Citigroup common stock with
exercise prices that are no less than the fair market value at the time of grant
(which is defined under the plan to be the NYSE closing price on the trading day
immediately preceding the grant date, or on the grant date for grants to certain
officers). Generally, options granted from 2003 through 2009 have six-year
terms, and vest ratably over three- or four-year periods; however, directors 
options cliff vest after two years, and vesting schedules for sign-on grants may
vary. The sale of shares acquired through the exercise of employee stock options
granted from 2003 through 2008 (and FA CAP options granted in 2009) is
restricted for a two-year period (and may be subject to the stock ownership
commitment of senior executives
thereafter).         Prior to 2003, Citigroup options, including
options granted since the date of the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group,
Inc., generally vested at a rate of 20% per year over five years (with the first
vesting date occurring 12 to 18 months following the grant date) and had 10-year
terms. Certain options, mostly granted prior to January 1, 2003, and with
10-year terms, permit an employee exercising an option under certain conditions
to be granted new options (reload options) in an amount equal to the number of
common shares used to satisfy the exercise price and the withholding taxes due
upon exercise. The reload options are granted for the remaining term of the
related original option and vest after six months. Reload options may in turn be
exercised using the reload method, given certain conditions. An option may not
be exercised using the reload method unless the market price on the date of
exercise is at least 20% greater than the option exercise price.

On October 29, 2009, Citigroup made a one-time broad-based option grant
to employees worldwide. The options have a six-year term, and generally vest in
three equal installments over three years, beginning on the first anniversary of
the grant date. The options were awarded with a strike price equal to the NYSE
closing price on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant
($4.08). The CEO and other employees whose 2009 compensation was subject
to structures approved by the Special Master did not participate
in this grant.        In January 2009, members of the Management
Executive Committee received 10% of their awards as performance-priced stock
options, with an exercise price that placed the awards significantly  out of the
money  on the date of grant. Half of each executive s options have an exercise
price of $17.85 and half have an exercise price of $10.61. The options were
granted on a day on which Citi s closing price was $4.53. The options have a
10-year term and vest ratably over a four-year
period.         On January 22, 2008, Vikram Pandit, CEO, was
awarded stock options to purchase three million shares of common stock. The
options vest 25% per year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date
and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. One-third of the options
have an exercise price equal to the NYSE closing price of Citigroup stock on the
grant date ($24.40), one-third have an exercise price equal to a 25% premium
over the grant-date closing price ($30.50), and one-third have an exercise price
equal to a 50% premium over the grant date closing price ($36.60). The first
installment of these options vested on January 22, 2009. These options do not
have a reload feature.         From 1997-2002, a broad base of employees
participated in annual option grant programs. The options vested over five-year
periods, or cliff vested after five years, and had 10-year terms but no reload
features. No grants have been made under these programs since
2002.

Information with respect
to stock option activity under Citigroup stock option programs for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: 

The following table
summarizes the information about stock options outstanding under Citigroup stock
option programs at December 31, 2009: 

As
of December 31, 2009, there was $445.6 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to stock options; this cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. 

Fair Value
Assumptions     Reload options are treated as separate grants from the related original
grants. Pursuant to the terms of currently outstanding reloadable options, upon
exercise of an option, if employees use previously owned shares to pay the
exercise price and surrender shares otherwise to be received for related tax
withholding, they will receive a reload option covering the same number of
shares used for such purposes, but only if the market price on the date of
exercise is at least 20% greater than the option exercise price. Reload options
vest after six months and carry the same expiration date as the option that gave
rise to the reload grant. The exercise price of a reload grant is the
fair-market value of Citigroup common stock on the date the underlying option is
exercised. Reload options are intended to encourage employees to exercise
options at an earlier date and to retain the shares acquired. The result of this
program is that employees generally will exercise options as soon as they are
able and, therefore, these options have shorter expected lives. Shorter option
lives result in lower valuations. However, such values are expensed more quickly
due to the shorter vesting period of reload options. In
addition, 

since reload options are
treated as separate grants, the existence of the reload feature results in a
greater number of options being valued. Shares received through option exercises
under the reload program, as well as certain other options, are subject to
restrictions on sale.         Additional valuation and related assumption
information for Citigroup option programs is presented below. Citigroup uses a
lattice-type model to value stock options.

9. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
    The Company has
several non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans covering certain
U.S. employees and has various defined-benefit pension and termination-indemnity
plans covering employees outside the United States. The U.S. qualified
defined-benefit plan provides benefits under a cash balance formula. However,
employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a
prior final-average pay formula under that plan. Effective January 1, 2008, the
U.S. qualified pension plan was frozen for most employees. Accordingly, no
additional compensation-based contributions were credited to the cash-balance
plan for existing plan participants during 2008 or 2009. However, certain
employees covered under the  

prior final-pay plan
continue to accrue benefits. The Company also offers postretirement health care
and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well
as to certain eligible employees outside the United
States.         The following tables summarize the components
of net (benefit) expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income and
the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for
the Company s U.S. qualified pension plan, postretirement plans and plans
outside the United States. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for
the U.S. plans as well as the plans outside the United
States. 

Net (Benefit) Expense  

(1)  
                       
              The U.S. plans exclude nonqualified pension plans, for which the
      net expense was $41 million in 2009, $38 million in 2008 and $45 million
      in 2007.  
            
              (2)  

The 2009 curtailment loss in the non-U.S pension plans includes $18
      million gain reflecting the sale of Citigroup s Nikko operations. See Note
      3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
      sale of Nikko operations.  

The estimated net
actuarial loss, prior service cost and net transition obligation that will be
amortized from    Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)    into net expense in
2010 are approximately $104 million, $2 million and $(2) million, respectively,
for defined-benefit pension plans. For postretirement plans, the estimated 2010
net actuarial loss and prior service cost amortizations are approximately $21
million and $(3) million, respectively. 

155  

Net Amount Recognized  

(1)  

The U.S. plans exclude nonqualified pension plans, for which the
      aggregate projected benefit obligation was $637 million and $586 million
      and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $636 million and $580
      million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These plans are
      unfunded. As such, the funded status of these plans is $(637) million and
      $(586) million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Accumulated other
      comprehensive income (loss)   reflects pretax charges of $137 million and $72 million at December
      31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, that primarily relate to net actuarial
      loss.   
            
              (2)  
                     
              Changes in projected benefit obligation due to curtailments in the
      non-U.S. pension plans in 2009 include $(3) million and $(9) million in
      curtailment gains and $16 million and $12 million in special termination
      costs during 2009 and 2008, respectively.  
            
              (3)  
                     
              Company contributions to the U.S. pension plan include $11 million
      and $13 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to certain
      investment advisory fees and administrative costs that were absorbed by
      the Company. Company contributions to the non-U.S. pension plans include
      $29 million and $55 million of benefits directly paid by the Company
      during 2009 and 2008, respectively.  
            
              (4)  
                 
              The U.S. qualified pension plan is fully funded under specified
      ERISA funding rules as of January 1, 2009 and projected to be fully funded
      under these rules as of December 31, 2009.

156  

The following table
shows the change in    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)    for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008: 

(1)  

Funded status consists of  Net
      amount recognized on the balance sheet  of the U.S. qualified and
      nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the
      non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans .   

At the end of 2009 and 2008, for both qualified and nonqualified plans
and for both funded and unfunded plans, the aggregate projected benefit
obligation (PBO), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), and  the aggregate fair value of plan assets for
pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, and
pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets,
were as follows:  

(1)  

In 2009, the PBO and ABO of the U.S. plans include $11,178 million
      and $11,129 million, respectively, relating to the qualified plan and $637
      million and $636 million, respectively, relating to the nonqualified
      plans. The PBO and ABO of the U.S. qualified pension plan did not exceed
      fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2008 and were not included in
      the 2008 benefit obligations summarized above .   

At December 31, 2009, combined
accumulated benefit obligations for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans,
excluding U.S. nonqualified plans, exceeded plan assets by $0.5 billion. At
December 31, 2008, combined plan assets for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans,
excluding U.S. nonqualified plans, exceeded the accumulated benefit obligations
by $1.0 billion. 

157  

Assumptions   

        The discount rate and future rate
of compensation assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement
benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Company s plans are shown in
the following table:  

(1)  
                       
              Weighted-average rates for the U.S. plans equal the stated
      rates.  
            
              (2)  
                 
              Effective January 1, 2008, the U.S. qualified pension plan was
      frozen. Only the future compensation increases for the grandfathered
      employees will affect future pension expense and obligations. Future
      compensation increase rates for small groups of employees were 4% or
      6%.  

A one-percentage-point
change in the discount rates would have the following effects on pension
expense: 

(1)  
                       
              Due to the freeze of the U.S. qualified pension plan commencing
      January 1, 2008, the majority of the prospective service cost has been
      eliminated and the gain/loss amortization period was changed to the life
      expectancy for inactive participants. As a result, pension expense for the
      U.S. qualified pension plan is driven more by interest costs than service
      costs, and an increase in the discount rate would increase pension
      expense, while a decrease in the discount rate would decrease pension
      expense.  

158  

Assumed health-care
cost-trend rates were as follows:  

A one-percentage-point
change in assumed health-care cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

Citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a long-term
assessment of return expectations, based on each plan s expected asset
allocation, and does not anticipate changing this assumption annually unless
there are significant changes in economic conditions or portfolio composition.
Market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide
range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for
projecting any past trends.         The expected long-term rates of return on
assets used in determining the Company s pension expense are shown below:

(1)  
                         
                Weighted-average rates for the U.S. plans equal the stated rates.
      As of December 31, 2008, the Company lowered its expected rate of return
      to 7.75%.  

A one-percentage-point
change in the expected rates of return would have the following effects on
pension expense:  

159  

Plan Assets    Citigroup s pension and postretirement plans 
asset allocations for the U.S. plans at the end of 2009 and 2008, and the target
allocations for 2010 by asset category based on asset fair values, are as
follows:  

(1)  
                       
              Target asset
      allocations for the U.S. plans are set by investment strategy, not by
      investment product. For example, private equities with an underlying
      investment in real estate are classified in the real estate asset
      category, not private equity.  
            
              (2)  
                 
              Equity
      securities in the U.S. pension plans include no Citigroup common stock at
      the end of 2009 and 2008.  

Third-party investment managers and third-party affiliated advisors
provide their respective services to Citigroup s U.S. pension plans. Assets are
rebalanced as the Pension Plan Investment Committee deems appropriate.
Citigroup s investment strategy, with respect to its pension assets, is to
maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset
classes, targeting an annual rate of return of 7.75% that, when combined with
Citigroup s contributions  

to the plans, will
maintain the plans  ability to meet all required benefit
obligations.        Citigroup s pension and postretirement plans 
weighted-average asset allocations for the non-U.S. plans and the actual ranges
at the end of 2009 and 2008, and the weighted-average target allocations for
2010 by asset category based on asset fair values, are as
follows: 

160  

Fair Value
Disclosure    Plan assets
by detailed asset categories and the fair value hierarchy are as
follows: 

(1)  

The investments of the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit
      plans are commingled in a trust. At December 31, 2009, the allocable
      interests of the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans were 98.9%
      and 1.1%, respectively.  
            
              (2)  
                       
              Other investments classified as Level 1 include futures carried at
      fair value.  

(1)  
                       
              The assets
      of the non-U.S. plans include assets of the top five countries, which make
      up 82% of all non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2009.

161  

Level 3 Roll Forward  

      The reconciliations of
the beginning and ending balances during the period for Level 3 assets are as
follows: 

Investment
Strategy    Citigroup s
global pension and postretirement funds  investment strategies are to invest in
a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to
participants. The investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return
that, when combined with Citigroup s contributions to the funds, will maintain
the funds  ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is controlled
through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and
international equities, fixed-income securities and cash. The target asset
allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is to have the majority of the
assets in either equity or debt securities. These allocations may vary by
geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations
and various other regional considerations. The wide variation in the actual
range of plan asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of
differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions. For example, in
certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be
invested in fixed-income investments, government funds, or local-country
securities.  

Significant Concentrations of Risk in
Plan Assets    The assets
of Citigroup s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of any
individual investment. The U.S. pension plan is diversified across multiple
asset classes, with publicly traded fixed income, hedge funds and private equity
representing the most significant asset allocations. Investments in these three
asset classes are further diversified across funds, managers,

strategies, vintages,
sectors and geographies, depending on the specific characteristics of each asset
class. The pension assets for Citigroup s largest non-U.S. plans are primarily
invested in publicly-traded fixed income and publicly-traded equity securities.

Risk management practices     Risk management oversight for Citigroup s U.S.
pension plans and largest non-U.S. pension plans is performed by Citigroup s
Independent Risk Management Regional Units. The risk oversight function covers
market risk, credit risk and operational risk. Although the specific components
of risk oversight are tailored to the requirements of each region and of each
country, the following risk management elements are common to all
regions: 

Periodic asset liability
  management and strategic asset allocation studies 
           
          Monitoring of funding levels and
  funding ratios 
           
          Monitoring compliance with asset
  allocation guidelines 
           
          Monitoring asset class performance
  against asset class benchmarks 
           
          Monitoring investor manager
  performance against benchmarks 
           
          Quarterly risk capital
  measurement   
       
        Risk management for the
remaining non-U.S. pension assets and liabilities is performed by Citigroup s
local country management. 

162  

Contributions     Citigroup s pension funding policy for U.S.
plans and non-U.S. plans is generally to fund to applicable minimum funding
requirements rather than to the amounts of accumulated benefit obligations. For
the U.S. plans, the Company may increase its contributions above the minimum
required contribution under ERISA, if appropriate to its tax and cash position
and the plans  funded position. For the U.S. pension plans, at December 31,
2009, there were no minimum required cash contributions, and no discretionary or
non-cash contributions are currently planned. For the non-U.S. pension plans,
discretionary cash contributions in 2010 are anticipated to be approximately
$160 million. In addition, the Company expects to contribute $35 million of
benefits to be directly paid by the Company for its unfunded non-U.S. pension
and postretirement plans. For the U.S. postretirement benefit plans, there are
no expected or required contributions for 2010. For the non-U.S. postretirement
benefit plans, expected cash contributions for 2010 are $72 million including $3
million of benefits to be directly paid by the Company. These estimates are
subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors,
such as market performance and regulatory requirements; in addition, management
has the ability to change funding policy.  

Estimated Future Benefit
Payments    The Company
expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years:

Prescription Drugs     In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription
Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the  Act of 2003 ) was enacted.
The Act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare known as
 Medicare Part D,  and a federal subsidy to sponsors of U.S. retiree health-care
benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D. The benefits provided to certain participants are at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and, accordingly, the Company is
entitled to a subsidy.        The expected subsidy reduced the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $148 million and $142
million as of January 1, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and the postretirement
expense by approximately $13 million and $17 million for 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  

The following table shows the estimated future benefit payments without
the effect of the subsidy and the amounts of the expected subsidy in future
years:  

Citigroup
401(k)     Under the
Citigroup 401(k) plan, a defined-contribution plan, eligible U.S. employees
received matching contributions up to 6% of their compensation in 2009, subject
to statutory limits. Effective January 7, 2010, the maximum amount of matching
contributions paid on employee deferral contributions made into this plan will
be reduced from 6% to 4% of eligible pay for all employees. The matching
contribution is invested according to participants  individual elections.
Additionally, for eligible employees whose compensation is $100,000 or less, a
fixed contribution of up to 2% of compensation is
provided.        The pretax expense associated with this plan
amounted to approximately $442 million and $580 million in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The decrease in expense from 2008 to 2009 reflects the reduction
in participants due to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture and other
reductions in workforce.

10. RESTRUCTURING    In the fourth quarter of 2008, Citigroup
recorded a pretax restructuring expense of $1.581 billion related to the
implementation of a Company-wide re-engineering plan. For the year ended
December 31, 2009, Citigroup recorded a pretax net restructuring release of $110
million composed of a gross charge of $86 million and a credit of $196 million
due to changes in estimates. The charges related to the 2008 Re-engineering
Projects Restructuring Initiative are reported in    Restructuring    on
the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income and are recorded in each
segment.         In 2007, the Company completed a review of its
structural expense base in a Company-wide effort to create a more streamlined
organization, reduce expense growth, and provide investment funds for future
growth initiatives. As a result of this review, a pretax restructuring charge of
$1.4 billion was recorded in    Corporate/Other   
during the first quarter of 2007. Additional net charges of $151 million were
recognized in subsequent quarters throughout 2007, and net releases of $31
million and $3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively, due to changes in
estimates. The charges related to 

the 2007 Structural
Expense Review Restructuring Initiative are reported in  Restructuring  on the Company s Consolidated
Statement of Income.        The primary goals of the 2008 Re-engineering
Projects Restructuring Initiative and the 2007 Structural Expense Review
Restructuring Initiative were:  

eliminate layers of
  management/improve workforce management; 
           
          consolidate certain back-office,
  middle-office and corporate functions; 
           
          increase the use of shared
  services; 
           
          expand centralized procurement;
  and 
           
          continue to rationalize
  operational spending on technology.   
       
             The implementation of these restructuring initiatives also caused certain
related premises and equipment assets to become redundant. The remaining
depreciable lives of these assets were shortened, and accelerated depreciation
charges began in the second quarter of 2007 and fourth quarter of 2008 for the
2007 and 2008 initiatives, respectively, in addition to normal scheduled
depreciation. 

The following tables detail the

11. INCOME TAXES  

The reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the
Company s effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing  operations (before noncontrolling interests
and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) for the years ended December 31
was as follows:   

(1)  
                        
              For 2009, relates to the conclusion of the audit of various issues
      in the Company s 2003   2005 U.S. federal tax audit and a tax benefit
      relating to the release of tax reserves on interchange fees.  
            
              (2)  
                        
              The Company recorded an income tax benefit for 2007. The effective
      tax rate (benefit) of (394)% primarily resulted from pretax losses in the
      Company's ICG and N.A. Regional Consumer Banking businesses (the U.S. is a
      higher tax rate jurisdiction). In addition, the tax benefits of permanent
      differences, including the tax benefit for not providing U.S. income taxes
      on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely
      invested, favorably impacted the Company's effective tax
  rate.  

166  

Deferred income taxes at
December 31 related to the following:  

The following is
a roll-forward of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits. 

Total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate are $2.2 billion,
$2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The remainder of    the
uncertain tax positions have offsetting amounts in other jurisdictions or are
temporary differences.        Interest and penalties (not included in the
 unrecognized tax benefits   above) are a component of the   Provision for income taxes   .  

(1)  
                       
              Includes $9
      million for foreign penalties.  

167  

The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and
other major taxing jurisdictions around the world. It is thus reasonably
possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax
benefits may occur within the next 12 months but the Company does not expect
such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant change to its
effective tax rate, other than the following item. The Company expects to
conclude the IRS audit of its U.S. Federal consolidated income tax returns for
the years 2003-2005 within the next 12 months. The gross uncertain tax positions
at December 31, 2009 for the items expected to be resolved is approximately $66
million plus gross interest of $10 million. The potential tax benefit to
continuing operations could be approximately $72
million.        The following are the major tax jurisdictions
in which the Company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year
subject to examination: 

Foreign pretax earnings approximated $6.8 billion in 2009, $10.3 billion
in 2008, and $9.1 billion in 2007 ($0.6 billion loss, $4.4 billion profit, and
$0.8 billion profit of which, respectively, are in discontinued operations). As
a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S.
taxation currently on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch.
Pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to U.S.
taxation when effectively repatriated. The Company provides income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such
earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States. At December 31,
2009, $27.3 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries were indefinitely invested. At the existing U.S. federal income tax
rate, additional taxes (net of U.S. foreign tax credits) of $7.4 billion would
have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently. The current year s
effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the
 Foreign income tax rate differential  line in the reconciliation of the federal
statutory rate to the Company s effective income tax
rate.        Income taxes are not provided for on the Company s savings bank base year
bad debt reserves that arose before 1988 because under current U.S. tax rules
such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed
in excess of limits prescribed by federal law. At December 31, 2009, the amount
of the base year reserves totaled approximately $358 million (subject to a tax
of $125 million).  

The Company has no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December
31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.  

The following table summarizes the amounts of tax carryforwards and their
expiry dates as of December 31, 2009: 

168  

With respect to the New York NOLs, the Company has recorded a net
deferred tax asset of $0.9 billion, along with less significant net operating
losses in various other states for which the Company has recorded a deferred tax
asset of $0.4 billion and which expire between 2012 and 2029. In addition, the
Company has recorded deferred tax assets in foreign subsidiaries, for which an
assertion has been made that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested, for
net operating loss carryforwards of $607 million (which expire 2012 - 2019) and
$69 million (with no expiration).        Although realization is not assured, the
Company believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset
of $46.1 billion is more likely than not based on expectations as to future
taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available tax
planning strategies, as defined in ASC 740,    Income Taxes   ,
(formerly SFAS 109) that could be implemented if necessary to prevent a
carryforward from expiring. Included in the net U.S. Federal DTA of $36.3
billion are $5 billion in DTLs that will reverse in the relevant carryforward
period and may be used to support the DTA , and $0.5 billion in compensation
deductions, which reduced additional paid-in capital in January, 2010 and for
which no adjustment was permitted to such DTA at December 31, 2009 because the
related stock compensation was not yet deductible to the Company. In general,
the Company would need to generate approximately $86 billion of taxable income
during the respective carryforward periods to fully realize its U.S. Federal,
state and local DTAs.        As a result of the recent losses incurred, the
Company is in a three-year cumulative pretax loss position at December 31, 2009.
A cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in
assessing the realizability of a DTA. The Company has concluded that there is
sufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence. The positive
evidence includes two means by which the Company is able to fully realize its
DTA. First, the Company forecasts sufficient taxable income in the carryforward
period, exclusive of tax planning strategies, even under stressed scenarios.
Secondly, the Company has sufficient tax planning strategies, including
potential sales of businesses and assets, in which it could realize the excess

of appreciated value
over the tax basis of its assets, in an amount sufficient to fully realize its
DTA. The amount of the DTA considered realizable, however, could be
significantly reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are significantly lower than forecasted due to
deterioration in market
conditions.        Based upon the foregoing discussion, as well
as tax planning opportunities and other factors discussed below, the U.S.
Federal and New York State and City net operating loss carryforward period of 20
years provides enough time to utilize the DTAs pertaining to the existing net
operating loss carryforwards and any NOL that would be created by the reversal
of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax
return.         The U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward
period is 10 years. In addition, utilization of foreign tax credits in any year
is restricted to 35% of foreign source taxable income in that year. Further,
overall domestic losses that the Company has incurred of approximately $45
billion are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of
50% of domestic source income produced in subsequent years and such resulting
foreign source income is in fact sufficient to cover the foreign tax credits
being carried forward. As such, the foreign source taxable income limitation
will not be an impediment to the foreign tax credit carryforward usage as long
as the Company can generate sufficient domestic taxable income within the
10-year carryforward period.         Regarding the estimate of future taxable
income, the Company has projected its pretax earnings, predominantly based upon
the  core  businesses that the Company intends to conduct going forward. These
 core  businesses have produced steady and strong earnings in the past. During
2008 and 2009, the  core  businesses were negatively affected by the large
increase in consumer credit losses during this sharp economic downturn cycle.
The Company has already taken steps to reduce its cost structure. Taking these
items into account, the Company is projecting that it will generate sufficient
pretax earnings within the 10-year carryforward period alluded to above to be
able to fully utilize the foreign tax credit carryforward, in addition to any
foreign tax credits produced in such period.  

169  

The Company has also examined tax planning strategies available to it
which would be employed, if necessary, to prevent a carryforward from expiring.
These strategies include repatriating low taxed foreign earnings for which an
assertion that the earnings have been indefinitely reinvested has not been made,
accelerating taxable income into or deferring deductions out of the latter years
of the carryforward period with reversals to occur after the carryforward period
(for example, selling appreciated intangible assets and electing straight-line
depreciation), holding onto available-for-sale debt securities with losses until
they mature and selling certain assets which produce tax exempt income, while
purchasing assets which produce fully taxable income. In addition, the sale or
restructuring of certain businesses, can produce significant taxable income
within the relevant carryforward
periods.         The Company s ability to utilize its deferred
tax assets to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if the
Company experiences an  ownership change,  as defined in Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). In general, an ownership
change will occur if there is a cumulative change in Citi s ownership by  5%
shareholders  (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a
rolling three-year period. The common stock issued pursuant to the exchange
offers in July, 2009 and the common stock and tangible equity units issued in
December, 2009 as part of Citigroup s TARP repayment did not result in an
ownership change under the Code. However, these common stock issuances have
materially increased the risk that Citigroup will experience an ownership change
in the future. On June 9, 2009, the board of directors of Citigroup adopted a
tax benefits preservation plan (the  Plan ). This Plan is subject to the
shareholders  approval at the 2010 Annual Meeting. The purpose of the Plan is to
minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring for Section 382
purposes. Despite adoption of the Plan, future transactions in our stock that
may not be in our control may cause Citi to experience an ownership change and
thus limit the Company s ability to utilize its deferred tax asset and reduce
its stockholders  equity.

12. EARNINGS PER
SHARE    The following is
a reconciliation of the income and share data used in the basic and diluted
earnings-per-share computations for the years ended December 31: 

(1)  
                       
              The Company adopted ASC 260-10-45 to 65 (FSP EITF 03-6-1) on
      January 1, 2009. All prior periods have been restated to conform to the
      current period s presentation.  
            
              (2)  
                       
              Due to the net loss available to common shareholders in 2009 and
      2008, loss available to common stockholders for basic EPS was used to
      calculate diluted EPS. Adding back the effect of dilutive securities would
      result in anti-dilution.  
            
              (3)  
                       
              Due to the net loss available to common shareholders in 2009 and
      2008, basic shares were used to calculate diluted EPS. Adding dilutive
      securities to the denominator would result in
  anti-dilution.  

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, weighted-average options to purchase 157.9
million, 156.1 million and 76.3 million shares of common stock, respectively,
were outstanding but not included in the computation of earnings per common
share, because the weighted-average exercise prices of $28.12, $41.19 and
$50.40, respectively, were greater than the average market price of the
Company s common stock. Additionally, warrants to purchase 210,084,034 shares of
common stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of TARP on November 28, 2008,
the warrants to purchase 188,501,414 shares of common stock issued to the U.S.
Treasury as part of TARP on December 31, 2008, and the warrants to purchase
66,531,728 shares of common stock  

issued to the U.S.
Treasury as consideration for the loss-sharing agreement on January 15, 2009
were not included in the computation of earnings per common share, because the
warrants  exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
Company s common stock. In addition, equity awards granted under the Management
Committee Long-Term Incentive Plan (MC LTIP) of approximately 3 million, 8
million and 16 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were not included
in the computation of earnings per common share because the performance targets
under the terms of the awards were not met. 

171  

13. FEDERAL FUNDS/SECURITIES
BORROWED, LOANED, AND SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE     AGREEMENTS    Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements
to resell, at their respective fair values, consisted of the following:

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase, at their respective fair values, consisted of the following:

The resale and
repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions used to
generate net interest income and facilitate trading activity. These instruments
are collateralized principally by government and government-agency securities
and generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to a
year.        It is the Company s policy to take possession of the underlying
collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the
agreements and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral
or reduction in the balance in order to maintain contractual margin protection.
In the event of counterparty default, the financing agreement provides the
Company with the right to liquidate the collateral
held.        The majority of the resale and repurchase agreements are recorded at fair
value. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially advanced
or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements.
Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are reported net by counterparty,
when applicable. Excluding the impact of the allowable netting, resale
agreements totaled $166.0 billion and $114.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.  

A majority of the deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits
received for securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or
received and are collateralized principally by government and government-agency
securities and corporate debt and equity securities. The remaining portion is
recorded at fair value as the Company elected fair value options for certain
securities borrowed and loaned portfolios. With respect to securities loaned,
the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the
market value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of
securities borrowed and securities loaned daily, and additional collateral is
obtained as necessary. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are reported
net by counterparty, when applicable.  

172  

14. BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE
PAYABLES    The Company
has receivables and payables for financial instruments purchased from and sold
to brokers, dealers and customers. The Company is exposed to risk of loss from
the inability of brokers, dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to
deliver the financial instruments sold, in which case the Company would have to
sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit
risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as
a counterparty to the transaction.        The Company seeks to protect itself from the
risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain
margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin
levels are monitored daily, and customers deposit additional collateral as
required. Where customers cannot meet collateral requirements, the Company will
liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into
compliance with the required margin
level.        Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may
impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to the Company.
Credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and brokers
and dealers engaged in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be
credit sensitive.        Brokerage receivables and brokerage payables,
which arise in the normal course of business, consisted of the following at
December 31:  

15. TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES     Trading account assets    and    Trading account liabilities   , at fair value, consisted of the following at
December 31: 

(1)  
                       
              Presented net, pursuant to master netting agreements. See Note 24
      to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding the
      accounting and reporting for
derivatives.  

173  

16. INVESTMENTS   

(1)  
                       
              Recorded at amortized cost.  
            
              (2)  
                       
              Unrealized gains and losses for non-marketable equity securities
      carried at fair value are recognized in earnings.  
            
              (3)  
                       
              Non-marketable equity securities carried at cost primarily consist
      of shares issued by the Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank,
      foreign central banks and various clearing houses of which Citigroup is a
      member.  

Securities
Available-for-Sale    The
amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale at December 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008 were as follows:  

(1)  
                       
              Reclassified to conform to the current period s
    presentation.  

At December 31, 2009, the cost of approximately 5,000 investments in
equity and fixed-income securities exceeded their fair value by $3.698 billion.
Of the $3.698 billion, the gross unrealized loss on equity securities was $212
million. Of the remainder, $1.756 billion represents fixed-income investments
that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position for less than a year and, of
these, 44% are rated investment grade; $1.730 billion represents fixed-income
investments that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position for a year or
more and, of these, 96% are rated investment grade.  

             Available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities-portfolio fair value
balance of $29.068 billion consists of $20.914 billion of government-sponsored
agency securities, and $8.154 billion of privately sponsored securities of which
the majority is backed by mortgages that are not Alt-A or subprime.

The decrease in gross unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities was
primarily related to a tightening of market spreads, reflecting a decrease in
risk/liquidity premiums. The decrease in gross unrealized losses on state and
municipal debt securities was the result of recovery in the municipal markets,
as liquidity increased and municipal bond yields decreased. 

             As discussed in more detail below, the Company conducts and documents
periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether
the impairment is other than temporary. Any credit-related impairment related to
debt securities the Company does not plan to sell and is not likely to be
required to sell is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of

174  

Income, with the
non-credit-related impairment recognized in OCI. For other impaired debt
securities, the entire impairment is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Income.

Debt Securities
Held-to-Maturity    During
the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company reviewed portfolios of debt securities
classified in    Trading account assets    and available-for-sale securities, and
identified positions where there had been a change of intent to hold the debt
securities for much longer periods of time than originally anticipated. The
Company believed that the expected cash flows to be generated from holding the
assets significantly exceed their current fair value, which had been
significantly and adversely impacted by the reduced liquidity in the global
financial markets.        Transfers of securities out of the trading
category must be rare. Citigroup made a number of transfers out of the trading
and available-for-sale categories in order to better reflect the revised
intentions of the Company in response to the recent significant deterioration in
market conditions, which were especially acute during the fourth quarter of
2008. These rare market conditions were not foreseen at the initial purchase
date of the securities. Most of the debt securities previously classified as
trading were bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the
short term, many in the context of Citigroup s acting as a market maker. At the
date of acquisition, most of these positions were liquid, and the Company
expected active and frequent buying and selling with the objective of generating
profits on short-term differences in price. However, subsequent declines in
value of these securities were primarily related to the ongoing widening of
market credit spreads reflecting increased risk and liquidity premiums that
buyers were demanding. As market liquidity decreased, the primary buyers for
these securities typically demanded returns on investments that were
significantly higher than previously
experienced.         Reclassification of debt securities were made
at fair value on the date of transfer. The December 31, 2008 carrying value of
the securities transferred from    Trading account assets    and available-for-sale securities was $33.3 billion and $27.0 billion,
respectively. The Company purchased an additional $4.2 billion of
held-to-maturity securities during the fourth quarter of 2008, in accordance
with prior commitments.  

176  

Debt
Securities Held-to-Maturity     The carrying value and fair value of
securities held-to-maturity (HTM) at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008
were as follows: 

(1)         
              For
      securities transferred to HTM from    Trading account
      assets   ,
      amortized cost is defined as the fair value amount of the securities at
      the date of transfer plus any accretion income and less any impairments
      recognized in earnings subsequent to transfer. For securities transferred
      to HTM from AFS, amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost,
      plus or minus any accretion or amortization of interest, less any
      impairment previously recognized in earnings.  
            
              (2)         
              HTM
      securities are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amortized cost
      and the changes in the value of these securities, other than impairment
      charges, are not reported on the financial statements.  

The net unrealized losses classified
in    Accumulated other comprehensive
income    (AOCI) relate to
debt securities reclassified from AFS investments to HTM investments, and to
additional declines in fair value for HTM securities that suffer credit
impairment. The balance was $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared to
$8.0 billion as of December 31, 2008. This balance is amortized over the
remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment  

of yield in a manner
consistent with the accretion of discount on the same transferred debt
securities. This will have no impact on the Company s net income because the
amortization of the unrealized holding loss reported in equity will offset the
effect on interest income of the accretion of the discount on these
securities. 

177  

The table below shows
the fair value of investments in HTM that have been in an unrecognized loss
position for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer as of December 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008: 

Excluded from the gross unrecognized losses presented in the above table
are the $7.6 billion and $8.0 billion of gross unrealized losses recorded in
AOCI related to the HTM securities that were reclassified from AFS investments
as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.  

Approximately $6.8
billion and $5.2 billion of these unrealized losses relate to securities that
have been in a loss position for 12 months or longer at December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. 

The following table
presents the carrying value and fair value of HTM debt securities by contractual
maturity dates as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008: 

(1)         
              Investments
      with no stated maturities are included as contractual maturities of
      greater than 10 years. Actual maturities may differ due to call or
      prepayment rights.  
            
              (2)         
              Includes
      asset-backed securities and all other debt securities.  

178  

Evaluating
Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments     The Company conducts and documents periodic
reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the
impairment is other than temporary. Prior to January 1, 2009, these reviews were
conducted pursuant to FASB Staff Position No. FAS 115-1,    The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to
Certain Investments    (now
incorporated into ASC 320-10-35,    Investments Debt and Equity Securities Subsequent
Measurement   ). Any
unrealized loss identified as other than temporary was recorded directly in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. As of January 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP
FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 (now incorporated into ASC 320-10-35-34,    Investments Debt and Equity Securities: Recognition of an
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment   ). This guidance amends the impairment model for debt securities; the
impairment model for equity securities was not
affected.        Under the new guidance for debt securities,
other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings for debt securities
which the Company has an intent to sell or which the Company believes it is
more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of the
amortized cost basis. For those securities which the Company does not intend to
sell or expect to be required to sell, credit-related impairment is recognized
in earnings, with the non-credit-related impairment recorded in
AOCI.         An unrealized loss exists when the current
fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
Unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are recorded,
net of tax, in AOCI for AFS securities, while such losses related to HTM
securities are not recorded, as these investments are carried at their amortized
cost. For securities transferred to HTM from    Trading account assets   , amortized cost is defined as the fair value of the securities at the
date of transfer, plus any accretion income and less any impairment recognized
in earnings subsequent to transfer. For securities transferred to HTM from AFS,
amortized cost is defined as the original purchase cost, plus or minus any
accretion or amortization of a purchase discount or premium, less any impairment
recognized in earnings subsequent to
transfer.         Regardless of the classification of the
securities as AFS or HTM, the Company has assessed each position for
impairment.           Factors considered in determining
whether a loss is temporary include:  

the length of time and the extent
  to which fair value has been below cost; 
           
          the severity of the
  impairment; 
           
          the cause of the impairment and
  the financial condition and near-term   prospects of the issuer; 
           
          activity in the market of the
  issuer which may indicate adverse credit   conditions; and 
           
          the Company s ability and intent
  to hold the investment for a period of   time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. 

The Company s review for impairment
generally entails:  

identification and evaluation of
  investments that have indications of   possible impairment; 
           
          analysis of individual investments
  that have fair values less than   amortized cost, including consideration of the length of time
  the   investment has been in an
  unrealized loss position and the expected   recovery period; 
           
          discussion of evidential matter,
  including an evaluation of factors or   triggers that could cause individual investments to qualify as
  having   other-than-temporary
  impairment and those that would not support   other-than-temporary impairment; and 
           
          documentation of the results of
  these analyses, as required under business   policies.   
       
               For equity securities, management
considers the various factors described above, including its intent and ability
to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for recovery to
amortized cost. Where management lacks that intent or ability, the security s
decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded in
earnings. AFS equity securities deemed other-than-temporarily impaired are
written down to fair value, with the full difference between fair value and
amortized cost recognized in
earnings.        For debt securities that are not deemed to be
credit impaired, management assesses whether it intends to sell or whether it is
more-likely-than-not that it would be required to sell the investment before the
expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. In most cases, management has
asserted that it has no intent to sell and that it believes it is not likely to
be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
Where such an assertion has not been made, the security s decline in fair value
is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded in
earnings.        For debt securities, a critical component of
the evaluation for other-than-temporary impairments is the identification of
credit impaired securities, where management does not expect to receive cash
flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. For
securities purchased and classified as AFS with the expectation of receiving
full principal and interest cash flows, this analysis considers the likelihood
of receiving all contractual principal and interest. For securities reclassified
out of the trading category in the fourth quarter of 2008, the analysis
considers the likelihood of receiving the expected principal and interest cash
flows anticipated as of the date of reclassification in the fourth quarter of
2008. The extent of the Company s analysis regarding credit quality and the
stress on assumptions used in the analysis have been refined for securities
where the current fair value or other characteristics of the security warrant.
The paragraphs below describe the Company s process for identifying credit
impairment in security types with the most significant unrealized losses as of
December 31, 2009.  

179  

Mortgage-backed
securities      For U.S. mortgage-backed securities (and in particular for Alt-A and
other mortgage-backed securities that have significant unrealized losses as a
percentage of amortized cost), credit impairment is assessed using a cash flow
model that estimates the cash flows on the underlying mortgages, using the
security-specific collateral and transaction structure. The model estimates cash
flows from the underlying mortgage loans and distributes those cash flows to
various tranches of securities, considering the transaction structure and any
subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure. The cash
flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgage-backed securities
through the current period and then projects the remaining cash flows using a
number of assumptions, including default rates, prepayment rates, and recovery
rates (on foreclosed properties).        Management develops specific assumptions using
as much market data as possible and includes internal estimates as well as
estimates published by rating agencies and other third-party sources. Default
rates are projected by considering current underlying mortgage loan performance,
generally assuming the default of (1) 10% of current loans, (2) 25% of 30 59 day
delinquent loans, (3) 75% of 60 90 day delinquent loans and (4) 100% of 91+ day
delinquent loans. These estimates are extrapolated along a default timing curve
to estimate the total lifetime pool default rate. Other assumptions used
contemplate the actual collateral attributes, including geographic
concentrations, rating agency loss projections, rating actions and current
market prices.         The key base assumptions for mortgage-backed
securities as of December 31, 2009 are in the table below: 

(1)         
              Loss
      severity rates are estimated considering collateral characteristics and
      generally range from 45% 60% for prime bonds, 50% 70% for Alt-A bonds, and
      65% 75% for subprime bonds.  

In addition, cash flow projections
are developed using more stressful parameters, and management assesses the
results of those stress tests (including the severity of any cash shortfall
indicated and the likelihood of the stress scenarios actually occurring based on
the underlying pool s characteristics and performance) to assess whether
management expects to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. If cash
flow projections indicate that the Company does not expect to recover its
amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes the estimated credit loss in
earnings. 

State and municipal
securities      Citigroup s AFS state and municipal bonds consist mainly of bonds that
are financed through Tender Option Bond programs. The process for identifying
credit impairment for bonds in this program as well as for bonds that were
previously financed in this program is largely based on third-party credit
ratings. Individual bond positions must meet minimum ratings requirements, which
vary based on the sector of the bond issuer. The average portfolio rating,
ignoring any insurance, is
Aa3/AA-.        Citigroup monitors the bond issuer and insurer
ratings on a daily basis. In the event of a downgrade of the bond below the
Aa3/AA-, the subject bond is specifically reviewed for potential shortfall in
contractual principal and interest. Citigroup has not recorded any credit
impairments on bonds held as part of the Tender Option Bond program or on bonds
that were previously held as part of the Tender Option Bond
program.        The remainder of Citigroup s AFS state and
municipal bonds, outside of the above, are specifically reviewed for credit
impairment based on instrument-specific estimates of cash flows, probability of
default and loss given default.

The following is a
12-month roll-forward of the credit-related position recognized in earnings for
AFS and HTM debt securities held as of December 31, 2009: 

181  

Investments
in Alternative Investment Funds     The Company holds investments in certain hedge
funds, private equity funds, fund of funds and real estate funds, and includes
both funds that are managed by the Company and funds managed by third parties.
These  

investments are
generally classified as non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value.
The fair value of these investments has been estimated using the net asset value
(NAV) per share of the Company s ownership interest in the funds, where it is
not probable that the Company will sell an investment at a price other than
NAV. 

(1 )          
              This
      category includes several real estate funds that invest primarily in
      commercial real estate in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These investments can
      never be redeemed with the funds. Distributions from each fund will be
      received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated. It is
      estimated that the underlying assets of the fund will be liquidated over a
      period of several years as market conditions allow. While certain assets
      within the portfolio may be sold, no specific assets have been identified
      for sale. Because it is not probable that any individual investment will
      be sold, the fair value of each individual investment has been estimated
      using the net asset value of the Company s ownership interest in the
      partners  capital. There is no standard redemption frequency nor is a
      prior notice period required. The investee fund s management must approve
      of the buyer before the sale of the investments can be
  completed.  

182  

17. LOANS   

(1 )          
              The Company
      classifies consumer and corporate loans based on the segment and
      sub-segment that manages the loans. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements.  
            
              (2 )          
              Loans
      secured primarily by real estate.  
            
              (3 )          
              Includes
      loans not otherwise separately categorized.  
            
              (4 )          
              The unearned
      income in 2008 includes loans that were transferred in that period from
      the held-for-sale category to the held-for-investment category at a
      discount to par.  

Included in the previous loan table are lending products whose terms may
give rise to additional credit issues. Credit cards with below-market
introductory interest rates, multiple loans supported by the same collateral
(e.g., home equity loans), and interest-only loans are examples of such
products. However, these products are not material to Citigroup s financial
position and are closely managed via credit controls that mitigate their
additional inherent risk. 

Impaired loans are those where Citigroup believes it is probable that it
will not collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of
the loan. Impaired loans include corporate non-accrual loans as well as
smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the
borrower s financial difficulties and Citigroup granted a concession to the
borrower. Such modifications may include interest rate reductions and/or
principal forgiveness. Valuation allowances for these loans are estimated
considering all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value
of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original contractual
effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of
collateral less disposal costs. These totals exclude smaller-balance homogeneous
loans that have not been modified and are carried on a non-accrual basis, as
well as substantially all loans modified for periods of 12 months or less.
At December 31, 2009, loans included in those short-term programs amounted to
$10.1 billion.           The following table presents
information about impaired loans:  

(1)         
              Prior to
      2008, the Company s financial accounting systems did not separately track
      impaired smaller-balance, homogeneous consumer loans whose terms were
      modified due to the borrowers  financial difficulties and it was
      determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. At December 31,
      2009 and 2008, such modified impaired consumer loans amounted to $15.899
      and $8.151 billion, respectively. However, information derived from the
      Company s risk management systems indicates that the amounts of such
      outstanding modified loans, including those modified prior to 2008,
      approximated $18.1 billion, $12.3 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31,
      2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  
            
              (2)         
              Excludes
      loans purchased for investment purposes.  
            
              (3)         
              Included in
      the    Allowance for loan
      losses   .  

183  

In addition, included in the loan table are purchased distressed loans,
which are loans that have evidenced significant credit deterioration subsequent
to origination but prior to acquisition by Citigroup. In accordance with SOP
03-3, the difference between the total expected cash flows for these loans and
the initial recorded investments is recognized in income over the life of the
loans using a level yield. Accordingly, these loans have been excluded from the
impaired loan information presented above. In addition, per SOP 03-3, subsequent
decreases to the expected cash flows for a purchased distressed loan require a
build of an allowance so the loan  

retains its level yield.
However, increases in the expected cash flows are first recognized as a
reduction of any previously established allowance and then recognized as income
prospectively over the remaining life of the loan by increasing the loan s level
yield. Where the expected cash flows cannot be reliably estimated, the purchased
distressed loan is accounted for under the cost recovery
method.        The carrying amount of the purchased distressed loan portfolio at
December 31, 2009 was $825 million net of an allowance of $95 million.

The changes in the
accretable yield, related allowance and carrying amount net of accretable yield
for 2009 are as follows:  

(1)         
              The balance
      reported in the column  Carrying amount of loan receivable  consists of
      $87 million of purchased loans accounted for under the level-yield method
      and $242 million under the cost-recovery method. These balances represent
      the fair value of these loans at their acquisition date. The related total
      expected cash flows for the level-yield loans were $101 million at their
      acquisition dates.  
            
              (2)         
              The balance
      reported in the column  Carrying amount of loan receivable  consists of
      $561 million of loans accounted for under the level-yield method and $359
      million accounted for under the cost-recovery method.

18. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

(1)         
              Reclassified
      to conform to the current period s presentation.  
            
              (2)         
              2009
      primarily includes reductions to the loan loss reserve of approximately
      $543 million related to securitizations, approximately $402 million
      related to the sale or transfers to held-for-sale of U.S. Real Estate
      Lending Loans, and $562 million related to the transfer of the U.K. Cards
      portfolio to held-for-sale. 2008 primarily includes reductions to the loan
      loss reserve of approximately $800 million related to FX translation, $102
      million related to securitizations, $244 million for the sale of the
      German retail banking operation, $156 million for the sale of CitiCapital,
      partially offset by additions of $106 million related to the Cuscatl n and

19. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE
ASSETS  

Goodwill     The changes in    Goodwill    during
2008 and 2009 were as follows:  

The changes in
   Goodwill    by segment during 2008 and 2009 were as
follows:  

(1)         
              Other
      changes in  Goodwill  primarily
      reflect foreign exchange effects on non-dollar-denominated goodwill, as
      well as purchase accounting adjustments.  

Goodwill impairment testing is performed at a level below the business
segments (referred to as a reporting unit). The changes in the organizational
structure in 2009 resulted in the creation of new reporting segments. As a
result, commencing with the second quarter of 2009, the Company has identified
new reporting units as required under ASC 350,    Intangibles Goodwill and Other   . Goodwill affected by the reorganization has
been reassigned from 10 reporting units to nine, using a fair value approach.
During 2009, goodwill was allocated to disposals and tested for impairment under
the new reporting units. The Company performed goodwill impairment testing for
all reporting units as of April 1, 2009 and July 1, 2009. Additionally, the
Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test for the    Local Consumer Lending    Cards reporting unit as of November 30, 2009. No goodwill was written
off due to impairment in 2009.  

During 2008, the share prices of financial stocks continued to be very
volatile and were under considerable pressure in sustained turbulent markets. In
this environment, Citigroup s market capitalization remained below book value
for most of the period and the Company performed goodwill impairment testing for
all reporting units as of February 28, 2008, July 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008.
The results of the first step of the impairment test showed no indication of
impairment in any of the reporting units at any of the periods except December
31, 2008 and, accordingly, the Company did not perform the second step of the
impairment test, except for the test performed as of December 31, 2008. As of
December 31, 2008, there was an indication of impairment in the    North America Consumer Banking, Latin America Consumer
Banking,    and    Local Consumer Lending    Other reporting units and, accordingly, the second step of testing was
performed on these reporting units.  

186  

Based on the results of the second step of testing, at December 31, 2008,
the Company recorded a $9.6 billion pretax ($8.7 billion after-tax) goodwill
impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008, representing most of the
goodwill allocated to these reporting units. The primary cause for the goodwill
impairment at December 31, 2008 in the above reporting units was rapid
deterioration in the financial markets, as well as in the global economic
outlook particularly during the period beginning mid-November through year-end
2008. The more significant fair value adjustments in the pro forma purchase
price allocation in the second step of testing were to fair value loans and debt
and were made to identify and value identifiable intangibles. The adjustments to
measure the assets, liabilities and intangibles were for the purpose of
measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not
reflected in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.        The following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances and the
excess of fair value as a percentage over allocated book value as of December
31, 2009. 

(1)         
             
                 Local Consumer
      Lending     Other        is excluded from the table as there
      is no goodwill allocated to it. 

While no impairment was noted in step one of the Company s    Local Consumer Lending    Cards reporting unit impairment test at November 30, 2009, goodwill
present in that reporting unit may be particularly sensitive to further
deterioration in economic conditions. Under the market approach for valuing this
reporting unit, the earnings multiples and transaction multiples were selected
from multiples obtained using data from guideline companies and acquisitions.
The selection of the actual multiple considers operating performance and
financial condition such as return on equity and net income growth of
   Local Consumer Lending    Cards as compared to the guideline companies
and acquisitions. For the valuation under the income approach, the Company
utilized a discount rate, which it believes reflects the risk and uncertainty
related to the projected cash flows, and selected 2012 as the terminal
year.        Small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations, in
particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the net income
projections, could significantly affect the Company s impairment evaluation and,
hence, results. If the future were to differ adversely from management s best
estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to decrease
by a small margin, the Company could potentially experience future material
impairment charges with respect to $4,683 million of goodwill remaining in our
   Local Consumer Lending    Cards reporting unit. Any such charges, by
themselves, would not negatively affect the Company s Tier 1, Tier 1 Common and
Total Capital regulatory ratios, its Tangible Common Equity or the Company s
liquidity position. 

187  

Intangible
Assets     The
components of intangible assets were as follows:  

(1)         
              Includes
      contract-related intangible assets.  

In 2009, Citigroup added $302
million in other intangibles, with a weighted-average amortization period
of 13 years.        Intangible assets amortization expense was
$1,179 million, $1,427 million and $1,267 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Intangible assets amortization expense is estimated to be $991
million in 2010, $934 million in 2011, $887 million in 2012, $802 million in
2013, and $770 million in 2014. 

The changes in
intangible assets during 2009 were as follows:  

(1)         
              Includes
      foreign exchange translation and purchase accounting
  adjustments.  
            
              (2)         
              See Note 23
      to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the roll-forward of mortgage
      servicing rights.

20. DEBT   

Short-Term
Borrowings    Short-term
borrowings consist of commercial paper and other borrowings with weighted
average interest rates as follows:  

Borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest rates based on
LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate, or bids submitted by the banks. Citigroup pays
commitment fees for its lines of
credit.         Some of Citigroup s non-bank subsidiaries have
credit facilities with Citigroup s subsidiary depository institutions, including
Citibank, N.A. Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance
with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve
Act.         CGMHI has committed financing with an
unaffiliated bank. At December 31, 2009, CGMHI had drawn down the full $125
million available, which is guaranteed by Citigroup. It also has substantial
borrowing agreements consisting of facilities that CGMHI has been advised are
available, but where no contractual lending obligation exists. These
arrangements are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure flexibility in meeting
CGMHI s short-term requirements. 

Long-Term Debt  

CGMHI has a syndicated five-year committed uncollateralized revolving
line of credit facility with unaffiliated banks totaling $3.0 billion, which was
undrawn at December 31, 2009 and matures in 2011. CGMHI also has committed
long-term financing facilities with unaffiliated banks. At December 31, 2009,
CGMHI had drawn down the full $900 million available under these facilities, of
which $150 million is guaranteed by Citigroup. Generally, a bank can terminate
these facilities by giving CGMHI one year prior notice. 

189  

CGMHI also has substantial borrowing arrangements consisting of
facilities that CGMHI has been advised are available, but where no contractual
lending obligation exists. These arrangements are reviewed on an ongoing basis
to ensure flexibility in meeting CGMHI s short-term
requirements.         The Company issues both fixed and variable
rate debt in a range of currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily
interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to
variable rate debt 

and variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The maturity structure of the
derivatives generally corresponds to the maturity structure of the debt being
hedged. In addition, the Company uses other derivative contracts to manage the
foreign exchange impact of certain debt issuances. At December 31, 2009, the
Company s overall weighted average interest rate for long-term debt was 3.51% on
a contractual basis and 3.91% including the effects of derivative contracts.

Aggregate annual
maturities of long-term debt obligations (based on final maturity dates)
including trust preferred securities are as follows:  

Long-term debt at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 includes
$19,345 million and $24,060 million, respectively, of junior subordinated debt.
The Company formed statutory business trusts under the laws of the state of
Delaware. The trusts exist for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing trust
securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the
Trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the trust securities in junior
subordinated deferrable interest debentures (subordinated debentures) of its
parent; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental
thereto. Upon approval from the Federal Reserve, Citigroup has the right to
redeem these securities.         Citigroup has contractually agreed not to
redeem or purchase (i) the 6.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred securities of
Citigroup Capital XV before September 15, 2056, (ii) the 6.45% Enhanced Trust
Preferred securities of Citigroup Capital XVI before December 31, 2046, (iii)
the 6.35% Enhanced Trust Preferred securities of Citigroup Capital XVII before
March 15, 2057, (iv) the 6.829% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Enhanced Trust
Preferred securities of Citigroup Capital XVIII before June 28, 2047, (v) the
7.250% Enhanced Trust Preferred securities of Citigroup Capital XIX before
August 15, 2047, (vi) the 7.875% Enhanced Trust Preferred securities of
Citigroup Capital 

XX before December 15,
2067, and (vii) the 8.300% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Enhanced Trust Preferred
securities of Citigroup Capital XXI before December 21, 2067, unless certain
conditions, described in Exhibit 4.03 to Citigroup s Current Report on Form 8-K
filed on September 18, 2006, in Exhibit 4.02 to Citigroup s Current Report on
Form 8-K filed on November 28, 2006, in Exhibit 4.02 to Citigroup s Current
Report on Form 8-K filed on March 8, 2007, in Exhibit 4.02 to Citigroup s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 2, 2007, in Exhibit 4.02 to Citigroup s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 17, 2007, in Exhibit 4.2 to
Citigroup s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 27, 2007, and in
Exhibit 4.2 to Citigroup s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 21,
2007, respectively, are met. These agreements are for the benefit of the holders
of Citigroup s 6.00% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due
2034. Citigroup owns all of the voting securities of these subsidiary trusts.
These subsidiary trusts have no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other
than those related to the issuance, administration, and repayment of the
subsidiary trusts and the subsidiary trusts  common securities. These subsidiary
trusts  obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
Citigroup.

The following table
summarizes the financial structure of each of the Company s subsidiary trusts at
December 31, 2009:  

(1)  
                       
              Represents the proceeds received from the Trust at the date of
      issuance.  

In each case, the coupon rate on the debentures is the same as that on
the trust securities. Distributions on the trust securities and interest on the
debentures are payable quarterly, except for Citigroup Capital III, Citigroup
Capital XVIII and Citigroup Capital XXI on which distributions are payable
semiannually.        During the third quarter of 2009, pursuant to
the  Exchange Offers,  Citigroup converted $5.8 billion liquidation value of
trust preferred securities across Citigroup Capital III, Citigroup Capital VII,
Citigroup Capital VIII,  

Citigroup Capital IX,
Citigroup Capital X, Citigroup Capital XI, Citigroup Capital XIV, Citigroup
Capital XV, Citigroup Capital XVI, Citigroup Capital XVII, Citigroup Capital
XVIII, Citigroup Capital XIX, Citigroup Capital XX and Citigroup Capital XXI to
common stock and issued $27.1 billion of Citigroup Capital XXXIII trust
preferred securities to the U.S. government in exchange for the Series G and I
of preferred stock.

192  

Regulatory Capital    Citigroup is subject to risk based capital and
leverage guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (FRB). Its U.S. insured depository institution subsidiaries, including
Citibank, N.A., are subject to similar guidelines issued by their respective
primary federal bank regulatory agencies. These guidelines are used to evaluate
capital adequacy and include the required minimums shown in the following
table.         The regulatory agencies are required by law to
take specific prompt actions with respect to institutions that do not meet
minimum capital standards. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, all of Citigroup s
U.S. insured subsidiary depository institutions were  well
capitalized.         At December
31, 2009, regulatory capital as set forth in guidelines issued by the U.S.
federal bank regulators is as follows:  

(1)  
                       
              Total Capital includes Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2
  Capital.  
            
              (2)  

Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average total
  assets.  
            
              (3)  

Applicable only to depository institutions. For bank holding
      companies to be  well capitalized,  they must maintain a minimum Leverage
      ratio of 3%.  

Banking Subsidiaries Constraints on
Dividends    There are
various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroup s subsidiary depository
institutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to
Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. Currently, the approval of the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of national banks, or the Office
of Thrift Supervision, in the case of federal savings banks, is required if
total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the
applicable agency s regulations. State-chartered depository institutions are
subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state
law.         In determining the dividends, each depository
institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and
leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal
regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally
pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Citigroup did not receive any
dividends from its banking subsidiaries during 2009. 

Non-Banking
Subsidiaries    Citigroup
also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries. These non-bank
subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on
dividends.         The ability of CGMHI to declare dividends can
be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries.

22. CHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)     Changes in each component of  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)  for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009 are as follows:

(1)  
                       
              Reflects, among other items: the movements in the British pound,
      Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Polish zloty and Mexican peso against the
      U.S. dollar, and changes in related tax effects and hedges.  
            
              (2)  

Primarily driven by Citigroup s pay fixed/receive floating interest
      rate swap programs that are hedging the floating rates on deposits and
      long-term debt.  
            
              (3)  

Reflects adjustments to the funded status of pension and
      postretirement plans, which is the difference between the fair value of
      the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation.  
            
              (4)  

The December 31, 2009 balance of $(4.3) billion for net unrealized
      losses on investment securities consists of $(4.7) billion for those
      investments classified as held-to-maturity and $0.4 billion for those
      classified as available-for-sale.

23. SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST
ENTITIES   

Overview    Citigroup and its subsidiaries are involved
with several types of off-balance-sheet arrangements, including special purpose
entities (SPEs). See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of impending accounting changes to the accounting for transfers and
servicing of financial assets and Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
including the elimination of Qualifying SPEs. 

Uses of SPEs    An SPE is an entity designed to fulfill a
specific limited need of the company that organized
it.         The principal uses of SPEs are to obtain
liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain of Citigroup s
financial assets, to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets, and
to create investment products for clients. SPEs may be organized in many legal
forms including trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization, the
company transferring assets to an SPE converts those assets into cash before
they would have been realized in the normal course of business, through the
SPE s issuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, commercial paper
and other notes of indebtedness, which are recorded on the balance sheet of the
SPE and not reflected on the transferring company s balance sheet, assuming
applicable accounting requirements are satisfied. Investors usually have
recourse to the assets in the SPE and often benefit from other credit
enhancements, such as a collateral account or over-collateralization in the form
of excess assets in the SPE, or from a liquidity facility, such as a line of
credit, liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement. The SPE can typically
obtain a more favorable credit rating from rating agencies than the transferor
could obtain for its own debt issuances, resulting in less expensive financing
costs. The SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the
yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE
investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the
provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any
related derivative
contracts.         SPEs may be Qualifying SPEs (QSPEs) or
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) or neither.  

Qualifying SPEs     QSPEs are a special class of SPEs that have significant limitations on
the types of assets and derivative instruments they may own or enter into and
the types and extent of activities and decision-making they may engage in.
Generally, QSPEs are passive entities designed to purchase assets and pass
through the cash flows from those assets to the investors in the QSPE. QSPEs may
not actively manage their assets through discretionary sales and are generally
limited to making decisions inherent in servicing activities and issuance of
liabilities. QSPEs are generally exempt from consolidation by the transferor of
assets to the QSPE and any investor or counterparty.  

Variable interest entities     VIEs are entities that have either a total
equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity
investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest (i.e.,
ability to make significant decisions through voting rights, right to receive
the expected residual returns of the entity and obligation to absorb the
expected losses of the entity). Investors that finance the VIE through debt or
equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support,
such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of
derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity. The variable
interest holder, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected
losses, receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns, or both,
is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.
Consolidation of a VIE is determined based primarily on variability generated in
scenarios that are considered most likely to occur, rather than based on
scenarios that are considered more remote. Certain variable interests may absorb
significant amounts of losses or residual returns contractually, but if those
scenarios are considered very unlikely to occur, they may not lead to
consolidation of the VIE.         All of these facts and circumstances are taken
into consideration when determining whether the Company has variable interests
that would deem it the primary beneficiary and, therefore, require consolidation
of the related VIE or otherwise rise to the level where disclosure would provide
useful information to the users of the Company s financial statements. In some
cases, it is qualitatively clear based on the extent of the Company s
involvement or the seniority of its investments that the Company is not the
primary beneficiary of the VIE. In other cases, a more detailed and quantitative
analysis is required to make such a
determination.         The Company generally considers the following
types of involvement to be significant:  

assisting in the structuring of a transaction and retaining any amount of
  debt financing (e.g., loans, notes, bonds or other debt instruments) or an
  equity investment (e.g., common shares, partnership interests or warrants);
           
         writing a  liquidity put  or other liquidity facility to support the
  issuance of short-term notes;
           
         writing credit protection (e.g., guarantees, letters of credit, credit
  default swaps or total return swaps where the Company receives the total
  return or risk on the assets held by the VIE); or
           
         certain transactions where the Company is the investment manager and
  receives variable fees for services.  
       
             In various other transactions, the Company may act as a derivative
counterparty (for example, interest rate swap, cross-currency swap, or purchaser
of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the
Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE); may act as
underwriter or placement agent; may provide administrative, trustee, or other
services; or may make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by
VIEs. The Company generally considers such involvement, by itself,  not
significant.

197  

This table does not include:  

certain venture capital investments made by some of the Company s private
  equity subsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in
  accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide;
           
         certain limited partnerships where the Company is the general partner and
  the limited partners have the right to replace the general partner or
  liquidate the funds;
           
         certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment
  management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides
  administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;
           
         VIEs structured by third parties where the Company holds securities in
  inventory. These investments are made on arm s-length terms; and
           
         transferred assets to a VIE where the transfer did not qualify as a sale
  and where the Company did not have any other involvement that is deemed to be
  a variable interest with the VIE. These transfers are accounted for as secured
  borrowings by the Company.  
       
             The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts
of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the
amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the legal
form of the asset (e.g., security or loan) and the Company s standard accounting
policies for the asset type and line of business.  

Funding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated VIEs Liquidity
Facilities and Loan
Commitments          The following table presents the notional
amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as
funding commitments in the SPE table as of December 31,
2009: 

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs where the Company has
significant involvement represent the most current information available to the
Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis
without regard to impairments in fair value, unless fair value information is
readily available to the Company. For VIEs that obtain asset exposures
synthetically through derivative instruments (for example, synthetic CDOs), the
table includes the full original notional amount of the derivative as an
asset.        The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount
of the Company s investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash
invested in the VIE plus any accrued interest and is adjusted for any
impairments in value recognized in earnings and any cash principal payments
received. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining
undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by
the Company, or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be
a variable interest, adjusted for any declines in fair value recognized in
earnings. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative
instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in
the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, or where the Company
is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total
return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the
SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum
exposure amounts.

     The following
table presents the carrying amounts and classifications of consolidated assets

The following table
presents the carrying amounts and classification of the third-party liabilities
of the consolidated VIEs:  

The consolidated VIEs included in the tables above represent hundreds of
separate entities with which the Company is involved. In general, the
third-party investors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal
recourse only to the assets of the VIEs and do not have such recourse to the
Company, except where the Company has provided a guarantee to the investors or
is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving the VIE. In
addition, the assets are generally restricted only to pay such liabilities.
Thus, the Company s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs
is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due
to outstanding third-party financing. Intercompany assets and liabilities are
excluded from the table.

Credit Card Securitizations     The Company securitizes credit card
receivables through trusts that are established to purchase the receivables.
Citigroup sells receivables into the QSPE trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit
card securitizations are revolving securitizations; that is, as customers pay
their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to purchase new
receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust. The Company relies on
securitizations to fund a significant portion of its managed   North America    Cards
business.   

The following table
reflects amounts related to the Company s securitized credit card receivables:

Credit Card Securitizations Citicorp     In the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, the Company recorded net gains (losses) from securitization of Citicorp s
credit card receivables of $349 million, $(1,007) million and $416 million,
respectively. Net gains (losses) reflect the following: 

incremental gains (losses) from new securitizations;
           
         the reversal of the allowance for loan losses associated with receivables
  sold;
           
         net gains on replenishments of the trust assets offset by
  other-than-temporary impairments; and
           
         changes in fair value for the portion of the residual interest classified
  as trading assets.  

The
following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to Citicorp s
credit card securitizations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007:  

As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the residual interest in
securitized credit card receivables was valued at $0 for Citicorp. Considering
the residual interest was written down to $0 at December 31, 2008, key
assumptions used in measuring its fair value at the date of sale or
securitization are not provided for 2009, but are provided for 2008. The below
table reflects these assumptions: 

At December 31, 2009, the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse

Managed
Loans Citicorp    After
securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to maintain
credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for
receivables transferred to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the
securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it
manages. 

             Managed-basis (Managed) presentations are non-GAAP financial measures.
Managed presentations include results from both the on-balance-sheet loans and
off-balance-sheet loans, and exclude the impact of card securitization activity.
Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold and
present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as Citigroup's
owned loans. Citigroup s management believes that Managed presentations provide
a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of those
results in prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of unusual gains
and charges in the current period. Management further believes that a meaningful
analysis of the Company s financial performance requires an understanding of the
factors underlying that performance and that investors find it useful to see
these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the
impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in Citigroup s underlying
performance.        The following tables present a reconciliation
between the Managed basis and on-balance-sheet credit card portfolios and the
related delinquencies (loans which are 90 days or more past due) and credit
losses, net of recoveries.  

Credit Card Securitizations Citi Holdings     The Company recorded net gains (losses) from
securitization of Citi Holdings  credit card receivables of $(586) million,
$(527) million, and $668 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.        The following table summarizes selected cash
flow information related to Citi Holdings  credit card securitizations for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:  

Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the residual interest
at the date of sale or securitization of Citi Holdings  credit card receivables
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are as follows:

The constant prepayment rate assumption range reflects the projected
payment rates over the life of a credit card balance, excluding new card
purchases. This results in a high payment in the early life of the securitized
balances followed by a much lower payment rate, which is depicted in the
disclosed range.         The effect of two negative changes in each of
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained interests is
required to be disclosed. The negative effect of each change must be calculated
independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key
assumptions may not in fact be independent, the net effect of simultaneous
adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the
individual effects shown below.  

201  

At December 31, 2009, the key assumptions used to value retained
interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and
20% in each of the key assumptions were as follows:

and on-balance-sheet credit card portfolios and the related delinquencies (loans
which are 90 days or more past due) and credit losses, net of

Funding, Liquidity Facilities and
Subordinated Interests    Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables through three
securitization trusts Citibank Credit Card Master Trust ( Master Trust ), which
is part of Citicorp, and the Citibank OMNI Master Trust ( Omni Trust ) and
Broadway Credit Card Trust ( Broadway Trust ), which are part of Citi
Holdings.        Master Trust issues fixed- and floating-rate
term notes as well as commercial paper. Some of the term notes are issued to
multi-seller commercial paper conduits. In 2009, the Master Trust has issued
$4.3 billion of notes that are eligible for the Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility (TALF) program, where investors can borrow from the Federal
Reserve using the trust securities as collateral. The weighted average maturity
of the term notes issued by the Master Trust was 3.6 years as of December 31,
2009 and 3.8 years as of December 31, 2008.

Trust liabilities   

Both Omni and Broadway Trusts issue fixed- and floating-rate term notes,
some of which are purchased by multi-seller commercial paper conduits. The Omni
Trust also issues commercial paper. From time to time, a portion of the Omni
Trust commercial paper has been purchased by the Federal Reserve's Commercial
Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). In addition, some of the multi-seller conduits
that hold Omni Trust term notes have placed commercial paper with CPFF. The
total amount of Omni Trust liabilities funded directly or indirectly through the
CPFF was $2.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and $6.9 billion at December 31,
2008.        The weighted average maturity of the third-party term notes issued by the
Omni Trust was 2.0 years as of December 31, 2009 and 0.5 years as of December
31, 2008. The weighted average maturity of the third-party term notes issued by
the Broadway Trust was 2.5 years as of December 31, 2009 and 3.3 years as of
December 31, 2008.

Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. is the sole provider of full liquidity
facilities to the commercial paper programs of the Master and Omni Trusts. Both
of these facilities, which represent contractual obligations on the part of
Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. to provide liquidity for the issued commercial
paper, are made available on market terms to each of the trusts. The liquidity
facilities require Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. to purchase the commercial
paper issued by each trust at maturity, if the commercial paper does not roll
over, as long as there are available credit enhancements outstanding, typically
in the form of subordinated notes. The liquidity commitment related to the Omni
Trust commercial paper programs amounted to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2009
and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2008. The liquidity commitment related to the
Master Trust commercial paper program amounted to $14.5 billion at December 31,
2009 and $11.0 billion at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, none of the Master Trust or Omni Trust liquidity commitments
were drawn.        In addition, Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.
provides liquidity to a third-party, non-consolidated multi-seller commercial
paper conduit, which is not a VIE. The commercial paper conduit has acquired
notes issued by the Omni Trust. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. provides the
liquidity facility on market terms. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. will be
required to act in its capacity as liquidity provider as long as there are
available credit enhancements outstanding and if: (1) the conduit is unable to
roll over its maturing commercial paper; or (2) Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.
loses its A-1/P-1 credit rating. The liquidity commitment to the third-party
conduit was $2.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and $3.6 billion at December 31,
2008. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, none of this liquidity
commitment was drawn.        During the first half of 2009, all three of
Citigroup s primary credit card securitization trusts Master Trust, Omni Trust,
and Broadway Trust had bonds placed on ratings watch with negative implications
by rating agencies. As a result of the ratings watch status, certain actions
were taken by Citi with respect to each of the trusts. In general, the actions
subordinated certain senior interests in the trust assets that were retained by
Citi, which effectively placed these interests below investor interests in terms
of priority of payment.        As a result of these actions, based on the
applicable regulatory capital rules, Citigroup began including the sold assets
for all three of the credit card securitization trusts in its risk-weighted
assets for purposes of calculating its risk-based capital ratios during 2009.
The increase in risk-weighted  

assets occurred in the
quarter during 2009 in which the respective actions took place. The effect of
these changes increased Citigroup s risk-weighted assets by approximately $82
billion, and decreased Citigroup s Tier 1 Capital ratio by approximately 100
basis points each as of March 31, 2009, with respect to the Master and Omni
Trusts. The inclusion of the Broadway Trust increased Citigroup s risk-weighted
assets by an additional approximately $900 million at June 30, 2009. All bond
ratings for each of the trusts have been affirmed by the rating agencies, and no
downgrades have occurred as of December 31, 2009. 

Mortgage
Securitizations      The Company provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse
customer base. In connection with the securitization of these loans, the
Company s U.S. Consumer mortgage business retains the servicing rights, which
entitles the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding
principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to
service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a
termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees. In
non-recourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Company is the cost of
temporary advances of funds. In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share
credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as FNMA or FHLMC, or with
a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing occur
primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted
mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued
interest of the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying
property. The Company s mortgage loan securitizations are primarily
non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses
to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust.    Securities and Banking    and    Special Asset Pool    retain servicing for a limited number of
their mortgage securitizations.        The Company s Consumer business provides a
wide range of mortgage loan products to its customers. Once originated, the
Company often securitizes these loans through the use of QSPEs. These QSPEs are
funded through the issuance of Trust Certificates backed solely by the
transferred assets. These certificates have the same average life as the
transferred assets. In addition to providing a source of liquidity and less
expensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces the Company s credit
exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily
non-recourse. However, the Company generally retains the servicing rights and in
certain instances retains investment securities, interest-only strips and
residual interests in future cash flows from the trusts.

Gains (losses) recognized on the securitization of U.S. agency-sponsored
mortgages during 2009 were $(2) million. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
gains (losses) recognized on the securitization of non-agency-sponsored
mortgages were $20 million.        Agency and non-agency securitization gains
(losses) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $(15) million and
$145 million, respectively.  

                Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at
the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:   

The range in the key assumptions for retained interests in    Securities and Banking    is due to the different characteristics of the interests retained by the
Company. The interests retained by    Securities and Banking    range from highly rated and/or senior in the capital structure to
unrated and/or residual interests.        The effect of adverse changes of 10% and 20%
in each of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained
interests is disclosed below. The negative effect of each change is calculated
independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key
assumptions may not in fact be independent, the net effect of simultaneous
adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the
individual effects shown below. 

At December 31, 2009, the key assumptions used to value retained
interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and
20% in each of the key assumptions were as follows:

Mortgage Securitizations Citi
Holdings      The following tables summarize selected cash flow information related to
mortgage securitizations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

The Company did not recognize gains (losses) on the securitization of
U.S. agency- and non-agency-sponsored mortgages in the year ended December 31,
2009. There were gains from the securitization of agency- and
non-agency-sponsored mortgages of $73 million and $(27) million in the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

                Key assumptions used in measuring
the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of
mortgage receivables for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows:   

The range in the key assumptions for retained interests in    Special Asset Pool   
and    Local Consumer Lending    is due to the different characteristics of
the interests retained by the Company. The interests retained by    Securities and Banking    range from highly rated and/or senior in the capital structure to
unrated and/or residual interests.        The effect of adverse changes of 10% and 20%
in each of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained
interests is disclosed below. The negative effect of each change is calculated
independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key
assumptions may not in fact be independent, the net effect of simultaneous
adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the
individual effects shown below.        At December 31, 2009, the key assumptions used
to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse
changes of 10% and 20% in each of the key assumptions were as
follows:

Mortgage
Servicing Rights     The fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) was $6.5
billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The MSRs
correspond to principal loan balances of $555 billion and $662 billion as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table summarizes the
changes in capitalized MSRs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008:

(1)       Represents changes due to
customer payments and passage of time.  

The market for MSRs is not sufficiently liquid to provide participants
with quoted market prices. Therefore, the Company uses an option-adjusted spread
valuation approach to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists
of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and
discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The key
assumptions used in the valuation of MSRs include mortgage prepayment speeds and
discount rates. The model assumptions and the MSRs  fair value estimates are
compared to observable trades of similar MSR portfolios and interest-only
security portfolios, as available, as well as to MSR broker valuations and
industry surveys. The cash flow model and underlying prepayment and interest
rate models used to value these MSRs are subject to validation in accordance
with the Company s model validation
policies.        The fair value of the MSRs is primarily
affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest
rates. In managing this risk, the Company economically hedges a significant
portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative
contracts, forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities and
purchased securities classified as
trading.        The Company receives fees during the course of
servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:  

These fees are classified in the
Consolidated Statement of Income as    Commissions and fees   .  

Student Loan
Securitizations      Through the Company s Local Consumer Lending business within Citi
Holdings, the Company maintains programs to securitize certain portfolios of
student loan assets. Under these securitization programs, transactions
qualifying as sales are off-balance-sheet transactions in which the loans are
removed from the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and sold to a
QSPE. These QSPEs are funded through the issuance of pass-through term notes
collateralized solely by the trust assets. For these off-balance-sheet
securitizations, the Company generally retains interests in the form of
subordinated residual interests (i.e., interest-only strips) and servicing
rights.        Under terms of the trust arrangements, the Company has no obligations to
provide financial support and has not provided such support. A substantial
portion of the credit risk associated with the securitized loans has been
transferred to third-party guarantors or insurers either under the Federal
Family Education Loan Program, authorized by the U.S. Department of Education
under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or private credit
insurance.        The following tables summarize selected cash
flow information related to student loan securitizations for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 

The Company did not recognize any gains or losses during 2009. The
Company recognized a gain of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008
and $71 million during the year ended December 31,
2007.        Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the residual interest
at the date of sale or securitization of Citi Holdings  student loan receivables
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are as follows:

          On-Balance-Sheet Securitizations Citi
Holdings     The
Company engages in on-balance-sheet securitizations. These are securitizations
that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus, the assets remain on the
Company s balance sheet. The following table presents the carrying amounts and
classification of consolidated assets and liabilities transferred in
transactions from the Consumer credit card, student loan, mortgage and auto
businesses, accounted for as secured borrowings: 

All assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral. The
cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated
liabilities, which are non-recourse to the Company s general assets.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial
Paper Conduits      The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper conduit
business as administrator of several multi-seller commercial paper conduits, and
also as a service provider to single-seller and other commercial paper conduits
sponsored by third parties.        The multi-seller commercial paper conduits are
designed to provide the Company s customers access to low-cost funding in the
commercial paper markets. The conduits purchase assets from or provide financing
facilities to customers and are funded by issuing commercial paper to
third-party investors. The conduits generally do not purchase assets originated
by the Company. The funding of the conduit is facilitated by the liquidity
support and credit enhancements provided by the
Company.        As administrator to the conduits, the Company
is responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the
conduits, making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits, including
determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued,
monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits  assets, and facilitating
the operations and cash flows of the conduits. In return, the Company earns
structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an
administration fee from the conduit, which is equal to the income from client
program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of interest costs and
other fees. This administration fee is fairly stable, since most risks and
rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the customers and, once the
asset pricing is negotiated, most ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively
stable as a percentage of the conduit s
size.        The conduits administered by the Company do not generally invest in
liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The assets are
privately negotiated and structured transactions that are designed to be held by
the conduit, rather than actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the
conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper
issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the client. Each asset
purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit
enhancement features provided by the third-party seller, including over
collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse
or third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with the
objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above, based on the Company s
internal risk ratings.        Substantially all of the funding of the
conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper, with a weighted average
life generally ranging from 30 to 45 days. As of December 31, 2009 and December
31, 2008, the weighted average life of the commercial paper issued was
approximately 43 days and 37 days, respectively. In addition, the conduits have
issued subordinate loss notes and equity with a notional amount of approximately
$76 million and varying remaining tenors ranging from six months to six
years. 

208  

The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in
the form of transaction-specific credit enhancement described above. In
addition, there are generally two additional forms of credit enhancement that
protect the commercial paper investors from defaulting assets. First, the
subordinate loss notes issued by each conduit absorb any credit losses up to
their full notional amount. It is expected that the subordinate loss notes
issued by each unconsolidated conduit are sufficient to absorb a majority of the
expected losses from each conduit, thereby making the single investor in the
subordinate loss note the primary beneficiary. Second, each conduit has obtained
a letter of credit from the Company, which is generally 8 10% of the conduit s
assets. The letters of credit provided by the Company total approximately $3.4
billion and are included in the Company s maximum exposure to loss. The net
result across all multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in
the event defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement
described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated in the following
order:  

subordinate loss note
  holders, 
           
          the Company, and 
           
          the commercial paper
  investors.   
       
             The Company also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity
agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a
market disruption, among other events. Each asset of the conduit is supported by
a transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase
agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has agreed to purchase non-defaulted
eligible receivables from the conduit at par. Any assets purchased under the APA
are subject to increased pricing. The APA is not designed to provide credit
support to the conduit, as it generally does not permit the purchase of
defaulted or impaired assets and generally reprices the assets purchased to
consider potential increased credit risk. The APA covers all assets in the
conduits and is considered in the Company s maximum exposure to loss. In
addition, the Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity in the
form of short-term lending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company has
agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term disruption in the
commercial paper market, subject to specified conditions. The total notional
exposure under the program-wide liquidity agreement is $11.3 billion and is
considered in the Company s maximum exposure to loss. The Company receives fees
for providing both types of liquidity agreement and considers these fees to be
on fair market terms.        Finally, the Company is one of several named
dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-based
fee for providing such services. Along with third-party dealers, the Company
makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial
paper pending sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in
the market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by

conduits administered by
the Company, as well as conduits administered by third parties. The amount of
commercial paper issued by its administered conduits held in inventory
fluctuates based on market conditions and activity. As of December 31, 2009, the
Company owned $70 million of the commercial paper issued by its administered
conduits.        The Company is required to analyze the
expected variability of the conduit quantitatively to determine whether the
Company is the primary beneficiary of the conduit. The Company performs this
analysis on a quarterly basis. For conduits where the subordinate loss notes or
third-party guarantees are sufficient to absorb a majority of the expected loss
of the conduit, the Company does not consolidate. In circumstances where the
subordinate loss notes or third-party guarantees are insufficient to absorb a
majority of the expected loss, the Company consolidates the conduit as its
primary beneficiary due to the additional credit enhancement provided by the
Company. In conducting this analysis, the Company considers three primary
sources of variability in the conduit: credit risk, interest rate risk and fee
variability.        The Company models the credit risk of the
conduit s assets using a Credit Value at Risk (C-VAR) model. The C-VAR model
considers changes in credit spreads (both within a rating class as well as due
to rating upgrades and downgrades), name-specific changes in credit spreads,
credit defaults and recovery rates and diversification effects of pools of
financial assets. The model incorporates data from independent rating agencies
as well as the Company s own proprietary information regarding spread changes,
ratings transitions and losses given default. Using this credit data, a Monte
Carlo simulation is performed to develop a distribution of credit risk for the
portfolio of assets owned by each conduit, which is then applied on a
probability-weighted basis to determine expected losses due to credit risk. In
addition, the Company continuously monitors the specific credit characteristics
of the conduit s assets and the current credit environment to confirm that the
C-VAR model used continues to incorporate the Company s best information
regarding the expected credit risk of the conduit s
assets.        The Company also analyzes the variability in the fees that it earns from
the conduit using monthly actual historical cash flow data to determine average
fee and standard deviation measures for each conduit. Because any unhedged
interest rate and foreign-currency risk not contractually passed on to customers
is absorbed by the fees earned by the Company, the fee variability analysis
incorporates those risks.        The fee variability and credit risk
variability are then combined into a single distribution of the conduit s
overall returns. This return distribution is updated and analyzed on at least a
quarterly basis to ensure that the amount of the subordinate loss notes issued
to third parties is sufficient to absorb greater than 50% of the total expected
variability in the conduit s returns. The expected variability absorbed by the
subordinate loss note investors is therefore measured to be greater than the
expected variability absorbed by the Company through its liquidity arrangements
and other fees earned, and the  

209  

investors in commercial
paper and medium-term notes. While the notional amounts of the subordinate loss
notes are quantitatively small compared to the size of the conduits, this is
reflective of the fact that most of the substantive risks of the conduits are
absorbed by the enhancements provided by the sellers (customers) and other third
parties that provide transaction-level credit enhancement. Because these risks
and related enhancements are generally required to be excluded from the
analysis, the remaining risks and expected variability are quantitatively small.
The calculation of variability focuses primarily on expected variability, rather
than the risks associated with extreme outcomes (for example, large levels of
default) that are expected to occur very infrequently. So while the subordinate
loss notes are sized appropriately compared to expected losses, they do not
provide significant protection against extreme or unusual credit losses. Where
such credit losses occur or become expected   to occur, the Company would consolidate the
conduit due to the additional credit enhancement provided by the Company.

Third-Party Commercial Paper
Conduits      The Company also provides liquidity facilities to single- and
multi-seller conduits sponsored by third parties. These conduits are
independently owned and managed and invest in a variety of asset classes,
depending on the nature of the conduit. The facilities provided by the Company
typically represent a small portion of the total liquidity facilities obtained
by each conduit, and are collateralized by the assets of each conduit. As of
December 31, 2009, the notional amount of these facilities was approximately
$792 million, and $187 million was funded under these facilities. 

Collateralized Debt and Loan
Obligations      A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is an SPE that purchases a pool of
assets consisting of asset-backed securities and synthetic exposures through
derivatives on asset-backed securities and issues multiple tranches of equity
and notes to investors. A third-party manager is typically retained by the CDO
to select the pool of assets and manage those assets over the term of the CDO.
The Company earns fees for warehousing assets prior to the creation of a CDO,
structuring CDOs and placing debt securities with investors. In addition, the
Company has retained interests in many of the CDOs it has structured and makes a
market in those issued notes.        A cash CDO, or arbitrage CDO, is a CDO
designed to take advantage of the difference between the yield on a portfolio of
selected assets, typically residential mortgage-backed securities, and the cost
of funding the CDO through the sale of notes to investors.  Cash flow  CDOs are
vehicles in which the CDO passes on cash flows from a pool of assets, while
 market value  CDOs pay to investors the market value of the pool of assets
owned by the CDO at maturity. Both types of CDOs are typically managed by a
third-party asset manager. In these transactions, all of the equity and notes
issued by the CDO are funded, as the cash is needed to purchase the debt
securities. In a typical cash CDO, a third-party investment manager selects a

portfolio of assets,
which the Company funds through a warehouse financing arrangement prior to the
creation of the CDO. The Company then sells the debt securities to the CDO in
exchange for cash raised through the issuance of notes. The Company s continuing
involvement in cash CDOs is typically limited to investing in a portion of the
notes or loans issued by the CDO and making a market in those securities, and
acting as derivative counterparty for interest rate or foreign currency swaps
used in the structuring of the
CDO.        A synthetic CDO is similar to a cash CDO, except that the CDO obtains
exposure to all or a portion of the referenced assets synthetically through
derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps. Because the CDO does not
need to raise cash sufficient to purchase the entire referenced portfolio, a
substantial portion of the senior tranches of risk is typically passed on to CDO
investors in the form of unfunded liabilities or derivative instruments. Thus,
the CDO writes credit protection on select referenced debt securities to the
Company or third parties and the risk is then passed on to the CDO investors in
the form of funded notes or purchased credit protection through derivative
instruments. Any cash raised from investors is invested in a portfolio of
collateral securities or investment contracts. The collateral is then used to
support the CDO s obligations on the credit default swaps written to
counterparties. The Company s continuing involvement in synthetic CDOs generally
includes purchasing credit protection through credit default swaps with the CDO,
owning a portion of the capital structure of the CDO in the form of both
unfunded derivative positions (primarily super-senior exposures discussed below)
and funded notes, entering into interest-rate swap and total-return swap
transactions with the CDO, lending to the CDO, and making a market in those
funded notes.        A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is
substantially similar to the CDO transactions described above, except that the
assets owned by the SPE (either cash instruments or synthetic exposures through
derivative instruments) are corporate loans and to a lesser extent corporate
bonds, rather than asset-backed debt securities.  

Consolidation     The Company has retained significant portions
of the  super-senior  positions issued by certain CDOs. These positions are
referred to as  super-senior  because they represent the most senior positions
in the CDO and, at the time of structuring, were senior to tranches rated AAA by
independent rating agencies. These positions include facilities structured in
the form of short-term commercial paper, where the Company wrote put options
( liquidity puts ) to certain CDOs. Under the terms of the liquidity puts, if
the CDO was unable to issue commercial paper at a rate below a specified maximum
(generally LIBOR + 35 bps to LIBOR + 40 bps), the Company was obligated to fund
the senior tranche of the CDO at a specified interest rate. As of December 31,
2009, the Company had purchased all $25 billion of the commercial paper subject
to these liquidity puts.  

210  

Since inception of many CDO transactions, the subordinate tranches of the
CDOs have diminished significantly in value and in rating. The declines in value
of the subordinate tranches and in the super senior tranches indicate that the
super-senior tranches are now exposed to a significant portion of the expected
losses of the CDOs, based on current market assumptions. The Company evaluates
these transactions for consolidation when reconsideration events
occur.        Upon a reconsideration event, the Company is at risk for consolidation
only if the Company owns a majority of either a single tranche or a group of
tranches that absorb the remaining risk of the CDO. Due to reconsideration
events during 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Company has consolidated 24 of
the 39 CDOs/CLOs in which the Company holds a majority of the senior
interests of the transaction.        The Company continues to monitor its
involvement in unconsolidated VIEs and if the Company were to acquire additional
interests in these vehicles or if the CDOs  contractual arrangements were to be
changed to reallocate expected losses or residual returns among the various
interest holders, the Company may be required to consolidate the CDOs. For cash
CDOs, the net result of such consolidation would be to gross up the Company s
balance sheet by the current fair value of the subordinate securities held by
third parties, which amounts are not considered material. For synthetic CDOs,
the net result of such consolidation may reduce the Company s balance sheet by
eliminating intercompany derivative receivables and payables in
consolidation. 

Key
Assumptions and Retained Interests Citi Holdings     The key assumptions, used for the
securitization of CDOs and CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2009, in
measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or
securitization are as follows:  

The effect of two negative changes in discount rates used to determine
the fair value of retained interests is disclosed below.  

Asset-Based
Financing Citicorp      The Company provides loans and other forms of
financing to VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit
approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the Company. Financings

reported in    Trading account assets    and accounted for at fair value through
earnings.

           Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond
(TOB) Trusts      The Company sponsors TOB trusts that hold fixed- and floating-rate,
tax-exempt securities issued by state or local municipalities. The trusts are
typically single-issuer trusts whose assets are purchased from the Company and
from the secondary market. The trusts issue long-term senior floating rate notes
(Floaters) and junior residual securities (Residuals). The Floaters have a
long-term rating based on the long-term rating of the underlying municipal bond
and a short-term rating based on that of the liquidity provider to the trust.
The Residuals are generally rated based on the long-term rating of the
underlying municipal bond and entitle the holder to the residual cash flows from
the issuing trust.        The Company sponsors three kinds of TOB
trusts: customer TOB trusts, proprietary TOB trusts and QSPE TOB
trusts. 

Customer TOB trusts    are trusts through which customers
  finance   investments in
  municipal securities and are not consolidated by the   Company. Proprietary and QSPE TOB trusts, on
  the other hand, provide   the
  Company with the ability to finance its own investments in municipal 
   securities. 
           
           Proprietary TOB trusts    are generally consolidated, in which case
  the   financing (the Floaters) is
  recognized on the Company s balance sheet as   a liability. However, certain proprietary
  TOB trusts are not consolidated   by the Company, where the Residuals are held by hedge funds that
  are   consolidated and managed by
  the Company. The assets and the associated   liabilities of these TOB trusts are not
  consolidated by the hedge funds   (and, thus, are not consolidated by the Company) under the application
    of ASC 946,    Financial Service Investment Companies   , which   precludes consolidation of owned
  investments. The Company consolidates   the hedge funds, because the Company holds controlling financial 
   interests in the hedge funds. Certain
  of the Company s equity investments   in the hedge funds are hedged with derivatives transactions executed
  by   the Company with third
  parties referencing the returns of the hedge fund. 
           
          QSPE TOB trusts
    provide the Company with the
  same exposure as   proprietary
  TOB trusts and are not consolidated by the Company.   

Credit rating distribution is based on the external rating of the
municipal bonds within the TOB trusts, including any credit enhancement provided
by monoline insurance companies or the Company in the primary or secondary
markets, as discussed below. The total assets for proprietary TOB Trusts
(consolidated and non-consolidated) includes $0.7 billion of assets where the
Residuals are held by a hedge fund that is consolidated and managed by the
Company.        The TOB trusts fund the purchase of their
assets by issuing Floaters along with Residuals, which are frequently less than
1% of a trust s total funding. The tenor of the Floaters matches the maturity of
the TOB trust and is equal to or shorter than the tenor of the municipal bond
held by the trust, and the Floaters bear interest rates that are typically reset
weekly to a new market rate (based on the SIFMA index). Floater holders have an
option to tender the Floaters they hold back to the trust periodically. Customer
TOB trusts issue the Floaters and Residuals to third parties. Proprietary and
QSPE TOB trusts issue the Floaters to third parties and the Residuals are held
by the Company.        Approximately $2.2 billion of the municipal
bonds owned by TOB trusts have an additional credit guarantee provided by the
Company. In all other cases, the assets are either unenhanced or are insured
with a monoline insurance provider in the primary market or in the secondary
market. While the trusts have not encountered any adverse credit events as
defined in the underlying trust agreements, certain monoline insurance companies
have experienced downgrades. In these cases, the Company has proactively managed
the TOB programs by applying additional secondary market insurance on the assets
or proceeding with orderly unwinds of the
trusts.        The Company, in its capacity as remarketing agent, facilitates the sale
of the Floaters to third parties at inception of the trust and facilitates the
reset of the Floater coupon and tenders of Floaters. If Floaters are tendered
and the Company (in its role as remarketing agent) is unable to find a new
investor within a specified period of time, it can declare a failed remarketing
(in which case the trust is unwound) or may choose to buy the Floaters into its
own inventory and may continue to try to sell it to a third-party investor.
While the level of the Company s inventory of Floaters fluctuates, the Company
held none of the Floater inventory related to the customer, proprietary and QSPE
TOB programs as of December 31,
2009.        If a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on
the underlying municipal bond, the underlying municipal bond is sold in the
secondary market. If there is an accompanying shortfall in the trust s cash
flows to fund the redemption of the Floaters after the sale of the underlying
municipal bond, the trust draws on a liquidity agreement in an amount equal to
the shortfall. Liquidity agreements are generally provided to the trust directly
by the Company. For customer TOBs where the Residual is less than 25% of the
trust s capital structure, the Company 

212  

has a reimbursement
agreement with the Residual holder under which the Residual holder reimburses
the Company for any payment made under the liquidity arrangement. Through this
reimbursement agreement, the Residual holder remains economically exposed to
fluctuations in value of the municipal bond. These reimbursement agreements are
actively margined based on changes in value of the underlying municipal bond to
mitigate the Company s counterparty credit risk. In cases where a third party
provides liquidity to a proprietary or QSPE TOB trust, a similar reimbursement
arrangement is made whereby the Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the
Company) as Residual holder absorbs any losses incurred by the liquidity
provider. As of December 31, 2009, liquidity agreements provided with respect to
customer TOB trusts totaled $6.2 billion, offset by reimbursement agreements in
place with a notional amount of $4.6 billion. The remaining exposure relates to
TOB transactions where the Residual owned by the customer is at least 25% of the
bond value at the inception of the transaction. In addition, the Company has
provided liquidity arrangements with a notional amount of $0.2 billion to QSPE
TOB trusts and other non-consolidated proprietary TOB trusts described
above.        The Company considers the customer and proprietary TOB trusts (excluding
QSPE TOB trusts) to be VIEs. Because third-party investors hold the Residual and
Floater interests in the customer TOB trusts, the Company s involvement and
variable interests include only its role as remarketing agent and liquidity
provider. On the basis of the variability absorbed by the customer through the
reimbursement arrangement or significant residual investment, the Company does
not consolidate the Customer TOB trusts. The Company s variable interests in the
Proprietary TOB trusts include the Residual as well as the remarketing and
liquidity agreements with the trusts. On the basis of the variability absorbed
through these contracts (primarily the Residual), the Company generally
consolidates the Proprietary TOB trusts. Finally, certain proprietary TOB trusts
and QSPE TOB trusts are not consolidated by application of specific accounting
literature. For the nonconsolidated proprietary TOB trusts and QSPE TOB trusts,
the Company recognizes only its residual investment on its balance sheet at fair
value and the third-party financing raised by the trusts is off balance
sheet.        The following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to

Citi Holdings  municipal bond securitizations for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007:  

Municipal
Investments      Municipal investment transactions represent partnerships that finance the
construction and rehabilitation of low-income affordable rental housing. The
Company generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a
return primarily through the receipt of tax credits earned from the affordable
housing investments made by the partnership.  

Client
Intermediation      Client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions
designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an
underlying security, referenced asset or index. These transactions include
credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the SPE
typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, referenced asset or index
through a derivative instrument, such as a total-return swap or a credit-default
swap. In turn the SPE issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the
specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The SPE invests the
proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract (GIC) that
serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the
transaction. The Company s involvement in these transactions includes being the
counterparty to the SPE s derivative instruments and investing in a portion of
the notes issued by the SPE. In certain transactions, the investor s maximum
risk of loss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified
level.        The Company s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as
the amount invested in notes issued by the SPE and the notional amount of any
risk of loss absorbed by the Company through a separate instrument issued by the
SPE. The derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a receivable
from the SPE (for example, where the Company purchases credit protection from
the SPE in connection with the SPE s issuance of a credit-linked note), which is
collateralized by the assets owned by the SPE. These derivative instruments are
not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not
included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the SPE. 

213  

Structured Investment
Vehicles      Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) are SPEs that issue junior notes
and senior debt (medium-term notes and short-term commercial paper) to fund the
purchase of high quality assets. The Company acts as manager for the
SIVs.         In order to complete the wind-down of the
SIVs, the Company purchased the remaining assets of the SIVs in November 2008.
The Company funded the purchase of the SIV assets by assuming the obligation to
pay amounts due under the medium-term notes issued by the SIVs, as the
medium-term notes mature. 

Investment
Funds      The
Company is the investment manager for certain investment funds that invest in
various asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, fixed
income and infrastructure. The Company earns a management fee, which is a
percentage of capital under management, and may earn performance fees. In
addition, for some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in the
investment funds.        The Company has also established a number of
investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private
equity investments. The Company acts as investment manager to these funds and
may provide employees with financing on both recourse and non-recourse bases for
a portion of the employees  investment commitments.  

Trust Preferred
Securities      The Company has raised financing through the issuance of trust preferred
securities. In these transactions, the Company forms a statutory business trust
and owns all of the voting equity shares of the trust. The trust issues
preferred equity securities to third-party investors and invests the gross
proceeds in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the
Company. These trusts have no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other
than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the
preferred equity securities held by third-party investors. These trusts 
obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the
Company.        Because the sole asset of the trust is a
receivable from the Company and the proceeds to the Company from the receivable
exceed the Company s investment in the VIE s equity shares, the Company is not
permitted to consolidate the trusts, even though the Company owns all of the
voting equity shares of the trust, has fully guaranteed the trusts  obligations,
and has the right to redeem the preferred securities in certain circumstances.
The Company recognizes the subordinated debentures on its balance sheet as
long-term liabilities.

24. DERIVATIVES
ACTIVITIES    In the
ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative
transactions. These derivative transactions include:  

Futures and forward
  contracts    which are
  commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity
  or currency at a contracted price and may be settled in cash or through
  delivery. 
           
           Swap contracts    which are commitments to settle in cash at
  a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years,
  based on differentials between specified financial indices, as applied to a
  notional principal amount. 
           
           Option contracts    which give the purchaser, for a fee, the
  right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time a
  financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may
  also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or
  prices.   
       
             Citigroup enters into these derivative contracts relating to interest
rate, foreign currency, commodity, and other market/credit risks for the
following reasons: 

Trading Purposes Customer
  Needs:    Citigroup offers
  its customers derivatives in connection with their risk-management actions to
  transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, foreign exchange and other
  market/ credit risks or for their own trading purposes. As part of this
  process, Citigroup considers the customers  suitability for the risk involved
  and the business purpose for the transaction. Citigroup also manages its
  derivative-risk positions through offsetting trade activities, controls
  focused on price verification, and daily reporting of positions to senior
  managers. 
           
           Trading Purposes Own
  Account:    Citigroup
  trades derivatives for its own account and as an active market maker. Trading
  limits and price verification controls are key aspects of this
  activity. 
           
           Hedging:    Citigroup uses derivatives in connection
  with its risk-management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the
  risk profile of the Company. For example, Citigroup may issue fixed-rate
  long-term debt and then enter into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest
  rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to convert the interest
  payments to a net variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common form
  of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes interest cost in certain yield
  curve environments. Derivatives are also used to manage risks inherent in
  specific groups of on-balance-sheet assets and liabilities, including
  investments, corporate and consumer loans, deposit liabilities, as well as
  other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign-exchange
  contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt,
  foreign-currency-denominated available-for-sale securities, net capital
  exposures and foreign-exchange transactions.   

Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity risks in
excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on
a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign-exchange rates and other factors and is a function of
the type of product, the volume of transactions, the tenor and terms of the
agreement, and the underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in
the event of nonperformance by the other party to the transaction where the
value of any collateral held is not adequate to cover such losses. The
recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these transactions is subject to
management s assessment as to collectability. Liquidity risk is the potential
exposure that arises when the size of the derivative position may not be able to
be rapidly adjusted in periods of high volatility and financial stress at a
reasonable cost.        Information pertaining to the volume of
derivative activity is provided in the tables below. The notional amounts, for
both long and short derivative positions, of Citigroup s derivative instruments
as of December 31, 2009 are presented in the table below.

Management
      hedges represent derivative instruments used in certain economic hedging
      relationships that are identified for management purposes, but for which
      hedge accounting is not applied. These derivatives are recorded in
         Other assets/liabilities
         on the

              (3)  

Credit
      derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection
      buyer) to transfer the credit risk of a  reference asset  to another party
      (protection seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to
      assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without
      directly purchasing that asset. The Company has entered into credit
      derivatives positions for purposes such as risk management, yield
      enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of
      overall risk.

The credit derivatives trading assets are composed of $68,558
      million related to protection purchased and $24,234 million related to
      protection sold as of December 31, 2009. The credit derivatives trading
      liabilities are composed of $24,162 million related to protection
      purchased and $58,262 million related to protection sold as of
      December 31, 2009.  

All derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. In
addition, where applicable, all such contracts covered by master netting
agreements are reported net. Gross positive fair values are netted with gross
negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to a valid master netting
agreement. In addition, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral
received from or paid to a given counterparty are included in this netting.
However, non-cash collateral is not
included.        As of December 31, 2009, the amount of
payables in respect of cash collateral received that was netted with unrealized
gains from derivatives was $30 billion, while the amount of receivables in
respect of cash collateral paid that was netted with unrealized losses from
derivatives was $41 billion. 

The amounts recognized in    Principal transactions    in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31,
2009 related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship
as well as the underlying non-derivative instruments are included in the table

classification, showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading
activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments
within the same trading portfolios, as this better represents the way these
portfolios are risk managed.

Accounting
for Derivative Hedging     Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815,
   Derivatives and Hedging    (formerly SFAS 133). As a general rule, hedge
accounting is permitted for those situations where the Company is exposed to a
particular risk, such as interest-rate or foreign-exchange risk, that causes
changes in the fair value of an asset or liability, or variability in the
expected future cash flows of an existing asset, liability or a forecasted
transaction that may affect
earnings.        Derivative contracts hedging the risks
associated with the changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges,
while contracts hedging the risks affecting the expected future cash flows are
called cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to
manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in
non-U.S.-dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries (net investment in a
foreign operation) are called net investment
hedges.        If certain hedging criteria specified in ASC 815 are met, including
testing for hedge effectiveness, special hedge accounting may be applied. The
hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies for similar hedges are performed in
a similar manner and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships.
For fair value hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative, as well
as the changes in value of the related hedged item due to the risk being hedged,
are reflected in current earnings. For cash flow hedges and net investment
hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are reflected in  Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss)  in Citigroup s stockholders  equity, to the extent the
hedge is effective. Hedge ineffectiveness, in either case, is reflected in
current earnings.        For asset/liability management hedging, the
fixed-rate long-term debt may be recorded at amortized cost under current U.S.
GAAP. However, by electing to use ASC 815 (SFAS 133) hedge accounting, the
carrying value of the debt is adjusted for changes in the benchmark interest
rate, with any such changes in value recorded in current earnings. The related
interest-rate swap is also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with any
changes  

in fair value reflected
in earnings. Thus, any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedging relationship
is recorded in current earnings. Alternatively, an economic hedge, which does
not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria, would involve only recording the
derivative at fair value on the balance sheet, with its associated changes in
fair value recorded in earnings. The debt would continue to be carried at
amortized cost and, therefore, current earnings would be impacted only by the
interest rate shifts and other factors that cause the change in the swap s value
and the underlying yield of the debt. This type of hedge is undertaken when
hedging requirements cannot be achieved or management decides not to apply ASC
815 hedge accounting. Another alternative for the Company would be to elect to
carry the debt at fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable
election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the
debt would be reported in earnings. The related interest rate swap, with changes
in fair value, would also be reflected in earnings, and provides a natural
offset to the debt s fair value change. To the extent the two offsets would not
be exactly equal, the difference would be reflected in current earnings. This
type of economic hedge is undertaken when the Company prefers to follow this
simpler method that achieves generally similar financial statement results to an
ASC 815 fair value hedge. 

             Key aspects of achieving ASC 815 hedge accounting are documentation of
hedging strategy and hedge effectiveness at the hedge inception and
substantiating hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis. A derivative must be
highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either
changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being
hedged. Any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognized in current
earnings. The assessment of effectiveness excludes changes in the value of the
hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged. Similarly, the
assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair value of a
derivative related to time value that, if excluded, are recognized in current
earnings. 

218  

Fair Value
Hedges   

Hedging of
benchmark interest rate risk     Citigroup hedges exposure to changes in the
fair value of outstanding fixed-rate issued debt and borrowings. The fixed cash
flows from those financing transactions are converted to benchmark variable-rate
cash flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps.
These fair value hedge relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to
determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception
and on an ongoing basis.        Citigroup also hedges exposure to changes in
the fair value of fixed-rate assets, including available-for-sale debt
securities and loans. The hedging instruments used are receive-variable,
pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Most of these fair value hedging relationships
use dollar-offset ratio analysis to determine whether the hedging relationships
are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis, while certain others
use regression analysis. 

Hedging of
foreign exchange risk     Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to
foreign-exchange rate movements in available-for-sale securities that are
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity
holding the securities, which may be within or outside the U.S. The hedging
instrument employed is a forward foreign-exchange contract. In this type of
hedge, the change in fair value of the hedged available-for-sale security
attributable to the portion of foreign exchange risk hedged is reported in
earnings and not  Accumulated
other comprehensive income  a process that serves to offset substantially
the change in fair value of the forward contract that is also reflected in
earnings. Citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts
(differential between spot and contractual forward rates) as the cost of
hedging; this is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
reflected directly in earnings. Dollar-offset method is used to assess hedge
effectiveness. Since that assessment is based on changes in fair value
attributable to changes in spot rates on both the available-for-sale securities
and the forward contracts for the portion of the relationship hedged, the amount
of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant.

Cash Flow
Hedges   

Hedging of
benchmark interest rate risk     Citigroup hedges variable cash flows resulting
from floating-rate liabilities and roll-over (re-issuance) of short-term
liabilities. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are converted to
fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest-rate
swaps and receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest-rate swaps.
These cash-flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or
dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are
highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Since efforts are made to
match the terms of the derivatives to those of the hedged forecasted cash flows
as closely as possible, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not
significant. 

Hedging of
foreign exchange risk     Citigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent of cash flows of
various balance sheet liability exposures, including short-term borrowings and
long-term debt (and the forecasted issuances or rollover of such items) that are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuing
entity. Depending on the risk-management objectives, these types of hedges are
designated as either cash-flow hedges of only foreign exchange risk or cash-flow
hedges of both foreign-exchange and interest rate risk, and the hedging
instruments used are foreign-exchange forward contracts, cross-currency swaps
and foreign-currency options. For some hedges, Citigroup matches all terms of
the hedged item and the hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis
to eliminate hedge ineffectiveness. Citigroup does not exclude any terms from
consideration when applying the matched terms method. To the extent all terms
are not perfectly matched, any ineffectiveness is measured using the
 hypothetical derivative method  from FASB   Derivative Implementation Group Issue G7 (now
ASC 815-30-35-12 through 35-32). Efforts are made to match up the terms of the
hypothetical and actual derivatives used as closely as possible. As a result,
the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant even when the terms do
not match perfectly. 

Hedging total
return     Citigroup
generally manages the risk associated with highly leveraged financing it has
entered into by seeking to sell a majority of its exposures to the market prior
to or shortly after funding. The portion of the highly leveraged financing that
is retained by Citigroup is hedged with a total return
swap.        The hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedges recognized in earnings
totals $16 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009.

For cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the end-user
derivative remaining in    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet will be
included in earnings of future periods to offset the variability of the hedged
cash flows when such cash flows affect earnings. The net loss associated with
cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from    Accumulated other comprehensive income    within 12 months of December 31, 2009 is
approximately $2.1 billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted
cash flows are hedged is 10 years.        The impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is
also shown in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

Net
Investment Hedges     Consistent with ASC 830-20,    Foreign Currency Matters   Foreign Currency
Transactions       (   formerly SFAS 52,
   Foreign Currency
Translation)   , ASC 815
allows hedging of the foreign-currency risk of a net investment in a foreign
operation. Citigroup uses foreign-currency forwards, options and swaps and
foreign-currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign-exchange
risk associated with Citigroup s equity investments in several non-U.S. dollar
functional currency foreign subsidiaries. Citigroup records the change in the
carrying amount of these investments in the    Cumulative translation adjustment    account within    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   . Simultaneously, the effective portion of the
hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the    Cumulative translation adjustment account    and the ineffective portion, if any, is
immediately recorded in earnings.        For derivatives used in net investment hedges,
Citigroup follows the forward-rate method from FASB Derivative Implementation
Group Issue H8 (now ASC 815-35-35-16 through 35-26),  Foreign Currency Hedges:
Measuring the Amount of Ineffectiveness in a Net Investment Hedge.  According to
that method, all changes in fair value, including changes  

220  

related to the
forward-rate component of the foreign-currency forward contracts and the
time-value of foreign-currency options, are recorded in the
foreign-currency    Cumulative translation adjustment account   . For foreign-currency denominated debt
instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation
gain or loss that is recorded in the foreign-currency translation adjustment
account is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of
the respective subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency
of Citigroup. To the extent the notional amount of the hedging instrument
exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of
the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the
functional currency of the net investment and Citigroup s functional currency
(or, in the case of a non-derivative debt instrument, such instrument is
denominated in the functional currency of the net investment), no
ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings.          The pretax loss recorded in
foreign-currency translation adjustment within    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   , related to the effective portion of the net
investment hedges, is $4,560 million during the year ended December 31,
2009. 

Credit
Derivatives     A
credit derivative is a bilateral contract between a buyer and a seller under
which the seller agrees to provide protection to the buyer against the credit
risk of a particular entity ( reference entity  or  reference credit ). Credit
derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make payments
to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined credit events (commonly referred
to as  settlement triggers ). These settlement triggers are defined by the form
of the derivative and the reference credit and are generally limited to the
market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the
reference credit and, in a more limited range of transactions, debt
restructuring. Credit derivative transactions referring to emerging market
reference credits will also typically include additional settlement triggers to
cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment
moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided on a portfolio
of referenced credits or asset-backed securities. The seller of such protection
may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of losses has
occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for
losses up to a specified amount.        The Company makes markets in and trades a
range of credit derivatives, both on behalf of clients as well as for its own
account. Through these contracts, the Company either purchases or writes
protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits. The
Company uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate
and consumer loan portfolio and other cash positions, to take proprietary
trading positions, and to facilitate client transactions. 

The range of credit derivatives sold includes credit default swaps, total
return swaps and credit options. 

             A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a protection
seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a
credit event on a reference entity. If there is no credit default event or
settlement trigger, as defined by the specific derivative contract, then
the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer
and receives only the contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event
occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the protection
seller will be required to make a payment to the protection
buyer.        A total return swap transfers the total economic performance of a
reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital
appreciation or depreciation. The protection buyer receives a floating rate
of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection
seller and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows associated
with the reference asset plus any appreciation. Thus, according to the total
return swap agreement, the protection seller will be obligated to make
a payment anytime the floating interest rate payment and any depreciation of the
reference asset exceed the cash flows associated with the underlying asset. A
total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset subject to
the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection
seller and the protection buyer.        A credit option is a credit derivative that
allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of the
reference asset. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer
assumes the obligation to purchase or sell the reference asset at a specified
 strike  spread level. The option purchaser buys the right to sell the reference
asset to, or purchase it from, the option writer at the strike spread level. The
payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or
the price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset. The options usually
terminate if the underlying assets
default.        A credit-linked note is a form of credit
derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap.
The purchaser of the note writes credit protection to the issuer, and receives a
return which will be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying
reference credit. If the reference entity defaults, the purchaser of the
credit-linked note may assume the long position in the debt security and any
future cash flows from it, but will lose the amount paid to the issuer of the
credit-linked note. Thus the maximum amount of the exposure is the carrying
amount of the credit-linked note. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
the amount of credit-linked notes held by the Company in trading inventory was
immaterial. 

221  

The following tables summarize the key characteristics of the Company s
credit derivative portfolio as protection seller as of December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008: 

(1)  
                      
              In addition,
      fair value amounts receivable under credit derivatives sold were $24,234
      million.  

(1)  
                      
              In addition,
      fair value amounts receivable under credit derivatives sold were $5,890
      million.  

Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit
derivatives to which it stands as a protection seller based on the
credit rating which has been assigned to the underlying referenced credit. Where
external ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (such
as Moody s and S P) are used, investment grade ratings are considered to be
Baa/BBB 

or above, while anything
below is considered non-investment grade. The Citigroup internal ratings are in
line with the related external credit rating system. On certain underlying
referenced credit, mainly related to over-the-counter credit derivatives,
ratings are not available, and these are included in the not-rated category.
Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-investment grade referenced
credit represent greater payment risk to the Company. The non-investment grade
category in the table above primarily includes credit derivatives where the
underlying referenced entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of
the derivative.        The maximum potential amount of future
payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based
on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company believes that the maximum
potential amount of future payments for credit protection sold is not
representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience. This
amount has not been reduced by the Company s rights to the underlying assets and
the related cash flows. In accordance with most credit derivative contracts,
should a credit event (or settlement trigger) occur, the Company is usually
liable for the difference between the protection sold and the recourse it holds
in the value of the underlying assets. Thus, if the reference entity defaults,
Citi will generally have a right to collect on the underlying reference credit
and any related cash flows, while being liable for the full notional amount of
credit protection sold to the buyer. Furthermore, this maximum potential amount
of future payments for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash
collateral paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be calculated
after netting all derivative exposures, including any credit derivatives with
that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement. Due to
such netting processes, determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to
credit derivative exposures only is not possible. The Company actively monitors
open credit risk exposures, and manages this exposure by using a variety of
strategies including purchased credit derivatives, cash collateral or direct
holdings of the referenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured
in the table above. 

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features in
Derivatives     Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the
Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any
outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified
credit-risk-related event. These events, which are defined by the existing
derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the
Company and its affiliates. The fair value of all derivative instruments with
credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position at
December 31, 2009 is $17 billion. The Company has posted $11 billion as
collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31,
2009. Each downgrade would trigger additional collateral requirements for the
Company and its affiliates. In the event that each legal entity was
downgraded a single notch as of December 31, 2009, the Company would
be required to post additional collateral of $2.6 billion. 

222  

25. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
RISK    Concentrations of
credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors
similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is
material in relation to Citigroup s total credit exposure. Although Citigroup s
portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry,
product, and geographic lines, material transactions are completed with other
financial institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives, and
foreign exchange businesses.        In connection with the Company s efforts to
maintain a diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any one
geographic region, country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on
a continuous basis. At December 31, 2009, Citigroup s most significant
concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies. The
Company s exposure, which primarily results from trading assets and investments
issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, amounted to $126.6 billion and
$93.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Mexican and
Japanese governments and their agencies are the next largest exposures, which
are rated investment grade by both Moody s and S P. The Company s exposure
to Mexico amounted to $41.4 billion and $35.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively, and is composed of investment securities, loans and trading
assets. The Company s exposure to Japan amounted to $31.8 billion and $29.1
billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is composed of
investment securities, loans and trading assets. 

26. FAIR VALUE
MEASUREMENT    Effective
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS 157 (now ASC 820-10), which defines
fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. Among other
things, the standard requires the Company to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In
addition, it precludes the use of block discounts when measuring the fair value
of instruments traded in an active market; such discounts were previously
applied to large holdings of publicly traded equity securities. It also requires
recognition of trade-date gains related to certain derivative transactions whose
fair value has been determined using unobservable market inputs. This guidance
supersedes the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3,  Issues
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities  (EITF
  Issue 02-3), which prohibited the
recognition of trade-date gains for such derivative transactions when
determining the fair value of instruments not traded in an active
market.        As a result of the adoption of the standard, the Company made amendments
to the techniques used in measuring the fair value of derivative and other
positions. These amendments change the way that the probability of default of a
counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative positions, include for
the first time the impact of Citigroup s own credit risk on derivatives and
other liabilities measured at fair value, and also eliminate the portfolio
servicing adjustment that is no longer necessary. 

Fair Value
Hierarchy     ASC
820-10 also specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the
inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable
inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable
inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have
created the following fair-value hierarchy: 

Level 1: Quoted prices for  identical  instruments in
  active markets. 
           
          Level 2: Quoted prices for  similar  instruments in
  active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
  that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant
  inputs and significant value drivers are  observable  in active markets. 
           
          Level 3: Valuations derived from
  valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant
  value drivers are  unobservable . 

This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.
The Company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations
where possible. The frequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread
and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar transactions are
all factors in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of
observed prices in those markets. 

223  

Determination of Fair
Value     For assets
and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company measures such value using the
procedures set out below, irrespective of whether these assets and liabilities
are carried at fair value as a result of an election or whether they were
previously carried at fair value.        When available, the Company generally uses
quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level
1. In some cases where a market price is available, the Company will make use of
acceptable practical expedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair
value, in which case the items are classified as Level
2.        If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon
internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current
market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates,
currency rates, option volatilities, etc. Items valued using such internally
generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level
input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be
classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are
readily observable.        Where available, the Company may also make use
of quoted prices for recent trading activity in positions with the same or
similar characteristics to that being valued. The frequency and size of
transactions and the amount of the bid-ask spread are among the factors
considered in determining the liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed
prices from those markets. If relevant and observable prices are available,
those valuations would be classified as Level 2. If prices are not available,
other valuation techniques would be used and the item would be classified as
Level 3.        Fair value estimates from internal valuation
techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent
vendors or brokers. Vendors and brokers  valuations may be based on a variety of
inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation
models.        The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the
Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value, including an
indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is
generally classified. Where appropriate, the description includes details of the
valuation models, the key inputs to those models as well as any significant
assumptions. 

Securities purchased under agreements to
resell and securities sold under agreements to
repurchase      No quoted prices exist for such instruments and so fair value is
determined using a discounted cash-flow technique. Cash flows are estimated
based on the terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded derivative
or other features. Expected cash flows are discounted using market rates
appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature and amount
of collateral taken or received. Generally, such instruments are classified
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the fair
valuation are readily observable. 

Trading account assets and
liabilities trading securities and trading
loans      When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the
fair value of trading securities; such items are classified as Level 1 of the
fair value hierarchy. Examples include some government securities and
exchange-traded equity securities.        For bonds and secondary market loans traded
over the counter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing internal
valuation techniques. Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques
are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors.
Vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing for
similar bonds or loans where no price is observable. If available, the Company
may also use quoted prices for recent trading activity of assets with similar
characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. Trading securities and loans
priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, when
less liquidity exists for a security or loan, a quoted price is stale or prices
from independent sources vary, a loan or security is generally classified as
Level 3.        Where the Company s principal market for a
portfolio of loans is the securitization market, the Company uses the
securitization price to determine the fair value of the portfolio. The
securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical
securitization in the current market, adjusted for transformation costs (i.e.,
direct costs other than transaction costs) and securitization uncertainties such
as market conditions and liquidity. As a result of the severe reduction in the
level of activity in certain securitization markets since the second half of
2007, observable securitization prices for certain directly comparable
portfolios of loans have not been readily available. Therefore, such portfolios
of loans are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
However, for other loan securitization markets, such as those related to
conforming prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate mortgage loans,
pricing verification of the hypothetical securitizations has been possible,
since these markets have remained active. Accordingly, these loan portfolios are
classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

224  

Trading account assets and
liabilities derivatives      Exchange-traded derivatives are generally fair
valued using quoted market (i.e., exchange) prices and so are classified as
Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy.        The majority of derivatives entered into by
the Company are executed over the counter and so are valued using internal
valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The
valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature
of the underlying instrument. The principal techniques used to value these
instruments are discounted cash flows, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation.
The fair values of derivative contracts reflect cash the Company has paid or
received (for example, option premiums paid and
received).        The key inputs depend upon the type of
derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate
yield curves, foreign-exchange rates, the spot price of the underlying
volatility and correlation. The item is placed in either Level 2 or Level 3
depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model.
Correlation and items with longer tenors are generally less
observable. 

Subprime-related direct exposures in
CDOs      The
Company accounts for its CDO super-senior subprime direct exposures and the
underlying securities on a fair-value basis with all changes in fair value
recorded in earnings. Citigroup s CDO super-senior subprime direct exposures are
not subject to valuation based on observable transactions. Accordingly, the fair
value of these exposures is based on management s best estimates based on facts
and circumstances as of the date of these Consolidated Financial
Statements.        Citigroup s CDO super-senior subprime direct
exposures are Level 3 assets. The valuation of the high-grade and mezzanine ABS
CDO positions uses trader prices based on the underlying assets of each
high-grade and mezzanine ABS CDO. Unlike the ABCP positions, the high-grade and
mezzanine positions are now largely hedged through the ABX and bond short
positions, which are trader priced. This results in closer symmetry in the way
these long and short positions are valued by the Company. Citigroup intends to
use trader marks to value this portion of the portfolio going forward so long as
it remains largely hedged.        The fair values of ABCP positions are
based on significant unobservable inputs. Fair value of these exposures are
based on estimates of future cash flows from the mortgage loans underlying the
assets of the ABS CDOs. To determine the performance of the underlying mortgage
loan portfolios, the Company estimates the prepayments, defaults and loss
severities based on a number of macroeconomic factors, including housing price
changes, unemployment rates, interest rates and borrower and loan attributes,
such as age, credit scores, documentation status, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and
debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. The model is calibrated using available mortgage
loan information including historical loan performance. In addition, the
methodology estimates the impact of geographic concentration of mortgages and
the impact of reported fraud in the origination of subprime mortgages. An
appropriate discount rate is then applied to the cash flows generated for each
ABCP tranche, in order to estimate its fair value under current market
conditions. 

When necessary, the valuation methodology used by Citigroup is refined
and the inputs used for the purposes of estimation are modified, in part, to
reflect ongoing market developments. More specifically, the inputs of home price
appreciation (HPA) assumptions and delinquency data were updated along with
discount rates that are based upon a weighted average combination of implied
spreads from single name ABS bond prices and ABX indices, as well as CLO spreads
under current market conditions.        The housing-price changes were estimated using
a forward-looking projection, which incorporated the Loan Performance Index. In
addition, the Company s mortgage default model also uses recent mortgage
performance data, a period of sharp home price declines and high levels of
mortgage foreclosures.        The valuation as of December 31, 2009 assumes
that U.S. housing prices are unchanged in 2010, increase 1.1% in 2011, increase
1.4% in 2012, and increase 3% from 2013
onwards.        In addition, the discount rates were based on
a weighted average combination of the implied spreads from single name ABS bond
prices, ABX indices and CLO spreads, depending on vintage and asset types. To
determine the discount margin, the Company applies the mortgage default model to
the bonds underlying the ABX indices and other referenced cash bonds and solves
for the discount margin that produces the current market prices of those
instruments.        The primary drivers that currently impact the
model valuations are the discount rates used to calculate the present value of
projected cash flows and projected mortgage loan
performance.        For most of the lending and structuring direct
subprime exposures (excluding super seniors), fair value is determined utilizing
observable transactions where available, other market data for similar assets in
markets that are not active and other internal valuation
techniques. 

Investments      The investments category includes
available-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities, whose fair value is
determined using the same procedures described for trading securities above or,
in some cases, using vendor prices as the primary
source.        Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity
and real estate entities held by the S B business. Determining the fair
value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management
resources and judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are
generally very thinly traded. In addition, there may be transfer restrictions on
private equity securities. The Company uses an established process for
determining the fair value of such securities, using commonly accepted valuation
techniques, including the use of earnings multiples based on comparable public
securities, industry-specific non-earnings-based multiples and discounted cash
flow models. In determining the fair value of nonpublic securities, the Company
also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial
public offerings, equity issuances, or other observable
transactions.        Private equity securities are generally
classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

225  

Short-term borrowings and long-term
debt      Where fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value of
non-structured liabilities is determined by discounting expected cash flows
using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Such
instruments are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as
all inputs are readily observable.        The Company determines the fair value of
structured liabilities (where performance is linked to structured interest
rates, inflation or currency risks) and hybrid financial instruments
(performance linked to risks other than interest rates, inflation or currency
risks) using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described above)
given the nature of the embedded risk profile. Such instruments are classified
as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to
the model. 

Market valuation
adjustments      Liquidity adjustments are applied to items in Level 2 and Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which
the entire position could be liquidated. The liquidity reserve is based on the
bid-offer spread for an instrument, adjusted to take into account the size of
the position.        Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are
applied to derivatives, such as over-the-counter derivatives, where the base
valuation uses market parameters based on the LIBOR interest rate curves. Not
all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant
LIBOR curve, so it is necessary to consider the market view of the credit risk
of a counterparty in order to estimate the fair value of such an
item.        Bilateral or  own  credit-risk adjustments are applied to reflect the
Company s own credit risk when valuing derivatives and liabilities measured at
fair value. Counterparty and own credit adjustments consider the expected future
cash flows between Citi and its counterparties under the terms of the instrument
and the effect of credit risk on the valuation of those cash flows, rather than
a point-in-time assessment of the current recognized net asset or liability.
Furthermore, the credit-risk adjustments take into account the effect of
credit-risk mitigants, such as pledged collateral and any legal right of offset
(to the extent such offset exists) with a counterparty through arrangements such
as netting agreements. 

Auction rate
securities      Auction rate securities (ARS) are long-term municipal bonds, corporate
bonds, securitizations and preferred stocks with interest rates or dividend
yields that are reset through periodic auctions. The coupon paid in the current
period is based on the rate determined by the prior auction. In the event of an
auction failure, ARS holders receive a  fail rate  coupon, which is specified by
the original issue documentation of each
ARS.        Where insufficient orders to purchase all of the ARS issue to be sold in
an auction were received, the primary dealer or auction agent would
traditionally have purchased any residual unsold inventory (without a
contractual obligation to do so). This residual inventory would then be repaid
through subsequent auctions, typically in a short timeframe. Due to this auction
mechanism and generally liquid market, ARS have historically traded and were
valued as short-term instruments.        Citigroup acted in the capacity of primary
dealer for approximately $72 billion of ARS and continued to purchase residual
unsold inventory in support of the auction mechanism until mid-February 2008.
After this date, liquidity in the ARS market deteriorated significantly,
auctions failed due to a lack of bids from third-party investors, and Citigroup
ceased to purchase unsold inventory. Following a number of ARS refinancings, at
December 31, 2009, Citigroup continued to act in the capacity of primary dealer
for approximately $28.2 billion of outstanding
ARS.        The Company classifies its ARS as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale
and trading securities.        Prior to the Company s first auction s failing
in the first quarter of 2008, Citigroup valued ARS based on observation of
auction market prices, because the auctions had a short maturity period (7, 28
and 35 days). This generally resulted in valuations at par. Once the auctions
failed, ARS could no longer be valued using observation of auction market
prices. Accordingly, the fair value of ARS is currently estimated using
internally developed discounted cash flow valuation techniques specific to the
nature of the assets underlying each
ARS.        For ARS with U.S. municipal securities as underlying assets, future cash
flows are estimated based on the terms of the securities underlying each
individual ARS and discounted at an estimated discount rate in order to estimate
the current fair value. The key assumptions that impact the ARS valuations are
estimated prepayments and refinancings, estimated fail rate coupons (i.e., the
rate paid in the event of auction failure, which varies according to the current
credit rating of the issuer) and the discount rate used to calculate the present
value of projected cash flows. The discount rate used for each ARS is based on
rates observed for straight issuances of other municipal securities. In order to
arrive at the appropriate discount rate, these observed rates were adjusted
upward to factor in the specifics of the ARS structure being valued, such as
callability, and the illiquidity in the ARS market.

For ARS with student loans as underlying assets, future cash flows are
estimated based on the terms of the loans underlying each individual ARS,
discounted at an appropriate rate in order to estimate the current fair value.
The key assumptions that impact the ARS valuations are the expected weighted
average life of the structure, estimated fail rate coupons, the amount of
leverage in each structure and the discount rate used to calculate the present
value of projected cash flows. The discount rate used for each ARS is based on
rates observed for basic securitizations with similar maturities to the loans
underlying each ARS being valued. In order to arrive at the appropriate discount
rate, these observed rates were adjusted upward to factor in the specifics of
the ARS structure being valued, such as callability, and the illiquidity in the
ARS market.        During the first quarter of 2008, ARS for
which the auctions failed and where no secondary market has developed were moved
to Level 3, as the assets were subject to valuation using significant
unobservable inputs. The majority of ARS continue to be classified as Level
3. 

Alt-A mortgage
securities      The Company classifies its Alt-A mortgage securities as held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, and trading investments. The securities classified as
trading and available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value reported in current earnings and AOCI, respectively. For these purposes,
Alt-A mortgage securities are non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
(RMBS) where (1) the underlying collateral has weighted average FICO scores
between 680 and 720 or (2) for instances where FICO scores are greater than 720,
RMBS have 30% or less of the underlying collateral composed of full
documentation loans.        Similar to the valuation methodologies used
for other trading securities and trading loans, the Company generally determines
the fair value of Alt-A mortgage securities utilizing internal valuation
techniques. Fair-value estimates from internal valuation techniques are
verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors. Vendors
compile prices from various sources. Where available, the Company may also make
use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities with the same or
similar characteristics to that being
valued.        The internal valuation techniques used for Alt-A mortgage securities, as
with other mortgage exposures, consider estimated housing price changes,
unemployment rates, interest rates and borrower attributes. They also consider
prepayment rates as well as other market
indicators.        Alt-A mortgage securities that are valued
using these methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, Alt-A mortgage
securities backed by Alt-A mortgages of lower quality or more recent vintages
are mostly classified as Level 3 due to the reduced liquidity that exists for
such positions, which reduces the reliability of prices available from
independent sources. 

Commercial real estate
exposure      Citigroup reports a number of different exposures linked to commercial
real estate at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings,
including securities, loans and investments in entities that hold commercial
real estate loans or commercial real estate directly. The Company also reports
securities backed by commercial real estate as Available-for-sale investments,
which are carried at fair value with changes in fair-value reported in
AOCI.        Similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities
and trading loans, the Company generally determines the fair value of securities
and loans linked to commercial real estate utilizing internal valuation
techniques. Fair-value estimates from internal valuation techniques are
verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors. Vendors
compile prices from various sources. Where available, the Company may also make
use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities or loans with the
same or similar characteristics to that being valued. Securities and loans
linked to commercial real estate valued using these methodologies are generally
classified as Level 3 as a result of the reduced liquidity currently in the
market for such exposures.        The fair value of investments in entities that
hold commercial real estate loans or commercial real estate directly is
determined using a similar methodology to that used for other non-public
investments in real estate held by the S B business. The Company uses an
established process for determining the fair value of such securities, using
commonly accepted valuation techniques, including the use of earnings multiples
based on comparable public securities, industry-specific non-earnings-based
multiples and discounted cash flow models. In determining the fair value of such
investments, the Company also considers events, such as a proposed sale of the
investee company, initial public offerings, equity issuances, or other
observable transactions. Such investments are generally classified as Level 3 of
the fair-value hierarchy. 

Highly leveraged financing
commitments      The Company reports highly leveraged loans with a carrying value of
$36 million and face amount of $468 million at December 31, 2009 as
held-for-sale, which are measured on a LOCOM basis. The fair value of such
exposures is determined, where possible, using quoted secondary-market prices
and classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy if there is a sufficient
level of activity in the market and quotes or traded prices are available with
suitable frequency.        However, due to the dislocation of the credit
markets and the reduced market interest in higher risk/higher yield instruments
since the latter half of 2007, liquidity in the market for highly leveraged
financings has been limited. Therefore, a majority of such exposures are
classified as Level 3 as quoted secondary market prices do not generally exist.
The fair value for such exposures is determined using quoted prices for a
similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of the loan being
valued. 

227  

Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis     The following tables present for each of the
fair value hierarchy levels the Company s assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The
Company often hedges positions that have been classified in the Level 3 category
with financial  

instruments that have been
classified as Level 1 or Level 2. In addition, the Company also hedges items
classified in the Level 3 category with instruments classified in Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the
following table. 

228  

(1)  
                       
              Represents
      netting of: (i) the amounts due under securities purchased under
      agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under
      agreements to repurchase, and (ii) derivative exposures covered by a
      qualifying master netting agreement, cash collateral, and the market value
      adjustment.  
            
              (2)  

There is no
      allowance for loan losses recorded for loans reported at fair
    value.

Changes in
Level 3 Fair Value Category     The following tables present the changes in
the Level 3 fair value category for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
The Company classifies financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy when there is reliance on at least one significant unobservable input
to the valuation model. In addition to these unobservable inputs, the valuation
models for Level 3 financial instruments typically also rely on a number of
inputs that are readily observable either directly or indirectly. Thus, the
gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to
both observable and unobservable inputs.  

The Company often
hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different
level. For example, the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level
3 category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting
losses and gains on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Company
in the Level 1 and Level 2 categories. In addition, the Company hedges items
classified in the Level 3 category with instruments also classified in Level 3
of the fair value hierarchy. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in
the following tables. 

230  

(1)         
              Changes in fair value for available-for-sale investments (debt
      securities) are recorded in    Accumulated other comprehensive
      income   , while
      gains and losses from sales are recorded in    Realized gains (losses) from sales
      of investments    on the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
            
              (2)  
              Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in    Commissions and fees
         on the
      Consolidated Statement of Income.  
            
              (3)  
              Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period,
      included in earnings (and    Accumulated other comprehensive
      income    for
      changes in fair value for available-for-sale investments), attributable to
      the change in fair value relating to assets and liabilities classified as
      Level 3 that are still held at December 31, 2009 and 2008.  
            
              (4)  
              Total Level 3 derivative exposures have been netted in these tables
      for presentation purposes only.  

231  

The following is a discussion of the changes to the Level 3 balances for
each of the roll-forward tables presented above. 

The significant changes
from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 in Level 3 assets and liabilities
are due to: 

A net decrease in
  trading securities of $10.8 billion that was driven by: 

Net transfers of $6.5 billion,
due mainly to the transfer of debt securities from Level 3 to Level 2 due to
increased liquidity and pricing transparency; and  

           Net settlements of $5.8 billion,
due primarily to the liquidations of subprime securities of $4.1 billion.

The change in
  net trading derivatives driven by:  

A net loss of $4.9 billion
relating to complex derivative contracts, such as those linked to credit, equity
and commodity exposures.   These
losses include both realized and unrealized losses during 2009 and are partially
offset by gains recognized in instruments that have been classified in Levels 1
and 2; and 

           Net increase in derivative assets of $4.3 billion, which
includes cash settlements of derivative contracts in an unrealized loss
position, notably those linked to subprime exposures. 

The decrease in Level
  3 Investments of $6.9 billion primarily resulted from:  

A reduction of $5.0 billion, due
mainly to paydowns on debt securities and sales of private equity
investments;  

           The net transfer of investment
securities from Level 3 to Level 2 of $1.5 billion, due to increased
availability of observable pricing inputs; and  

           Net losses recognized of $0.4
billion due mainly to losses on non-marketable equity securities including
write-downs on private equity investments. 

The decrease in
  securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $9.1 billion is driven by a
  $8.6 billion net transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 as effective maturity dates
  on structured repos have shortened. 

The decrease in
  long-term debt of $1.5 billion is driven mainly by  $1.3 billion of net
  terminations of structured notes. 

The significant changes from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 in
Level 3 are due to:  

A net decrease in
  trading securities and loans of $24.8 billion that was driven by:

Net realized and unrealized
losses of $28.1 billion recorded in    Principal transactions   , which was composed mostly of write-downs recognized on various trading
securities including ABCP of $9 billion;  

           Net transfers in of $7.4 billion,
which consisted of approximately $26 billion of net transfers in from Level 2 as
the availability of observable pricing inputs continued to decline due to the
current credit crisis, offset by transfers out of Level 3 of approximately $19
billion primarily related to Level 3 trading inventory being reclassified to
held-to-maturity investments during the fourth quarter of 2008; and

Net settlements of trading
securities of $4.2 billion.  

The shift in the net
  unrealized gains/(losses) from trading derivatives driven by:

A net gain of $7.8 billion
relating to complex derivative contracts, such as those linked to credit, equity
and commodity exposures.   These
gains include both realized and unrealized gains and are partially offset by
losses recognized in instruments that have been classified in Levels 1 and 2;
and 

           $2.2 billion in net transfers in.

The increase in
  Investments of $11.2 billion primarily resulted from:  

The addition of $10.3 billion
from net purchases, issuances and settlements, which included $8.7 billion in
senior debt securities retained by the Company from its sale of a corporate loan
portfolio that included highly leveraged loans during the second quarter of
2008, plus $3 billion of ARS securities purchased from    GWM    clients, in
accordance with the Auction Rate Securities settlement agreement;  

           The net transfer in of investment
securities from Level 2 of $5.8 billion, as the availability of observable
pricing inputs continued to decline due to the current credit crisis; and

Net losses recognized of $4.9
billion which was recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily related to Alt-A
MBS classified as available-for-sale investments.  

232  

The decrease in Mortgage Servicing
  Rights of $2.7 billion was primarily   attributed to mark-to-market losses recognized in the portfolio due
  to   decreases in the mortgage
  interest rates and increases in refinancing. 
           
          The increase in Securities sold
  under agreements to repurchase of $5   billion is driven by a $6.2 billion increase from net transfers in as
  the   continued credit crisis
  impacted the availability of observable inputs   for the underlying securities related to
  this liability. This was offset by a   reduction from net settlements of $1.4 billion. 
           
          The decrease in short-term
  borrowings of $3.7 billion is due to net transfers   out of $1.8 billion as valuation methodology
  inputs considered to be   unobservable were determined not to be significant to the overall
  valuation.   In addition, net
  payments of $1.8 billion were made during the year. 
           
          The increase in long-term debt of
  $2.2 billion is driven by:   
       
           The net transfers in of $38.8
billion, substantially all of which related to the transfer of consolidated SIV
debt in the first quarter of 2008, as the availability of observable inputs
continued to decline due to the current crisis; offset by  

           $2.2 billion in gains recognized
as credit spreads widened during the year; and 

           $34.3 billion decrease from net
settlements/payments. Included in these settlements were $21 billion of payments
made on maturing SIV debt and the replacement of $17 billion of non-recourse,
consolidated SIV debt classified as Level 3 with Citigroup debt classified as
Level 2. This replacement occurred in connection with the purchase of the SIV
assets by the Company in November 2008.  

Items Measured at Fair Value on a
Nonrecurring Basis    Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables
above.        These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair
value during the periods as a result of an impairment. In addition, these assets
include loans held-for-sale that are measured at LOCOM that were recognized at
fair value below cost at the end of the period.           The fair value of loans measured on a LOCOM
basis is determined where possible using quoted secondary-market prices. Such
loans are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy given the
level of activity in the market and the frequency of available quotes. If no
such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted
prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of
that loan.           The following table presents all loans
held-for-sale that are carried at LOCOM as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in
billions):  

233  

27. FAIR VALUE
ELECTIONS    The Company
may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported
in earnings. After the initial adoption, the election is made upon the
acquisition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm
commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The
fair-value election may not be revoked once an election is
made.         Additionally, the transition provisions of ASC
825-10 (SFAS 159) permit a one-time election for existing positions at the
adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment included in opening retained
earnings and future changes in fair value reported in earnings. 

             The Company also has elected to adopt the fair value accounting
provisions for certain assets and liabilities prospectively. Hybrid financial
instruments, such as structured notes containing embedded derivatives that
otherwise would require bifurcation, as well as certain interest-only
instruments, may be accounted for at fair value if the Company makes an
irrevocable election to do so on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The changes
in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Additional discussion regarding
the applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in
Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.         All servicing rights must now be recognized
initially at fair value. At its initial adoption, the standard permitted a
one-time irrevocable election to re-measure each class of servicing rights at
fair value, with the changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. The
classes of servicing rights are identified based on the availability of market
inputs used in determining their fair values and the methods for managing their
risks. The Company has elected fair-value accounting for its mortgage and
student loan classes of servicing rights. The impact of adopting this standard
was not material. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of mortgage servicing
rights.  

234  

The following table
presents, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of those positions
selected for fair-value accounting, as well as the changes in fair value for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 

(1)         
              Reclassified to conform to current period s
  presentation.  
            
              (2)  
              Reflects netting of the amounts due from securities purchased under
      agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under
      agreements to repurchase.  

235  

Own Credit Valuation
Adjustment    The fair
value of debt liabilities for which the fair value option was elected (other
than non-recourse and similar liabilities) was impacted by the narrowing of the
Company s credit spreads. The estimated change in the fair value of these debt
liabilities due to such changes in the Company s own credit risk (or
instrument-specific credit risk) was a loss of $4.226 billion and a gain of
$4.558 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk
were estimated by incorporating the Company s current observable credit spreads
into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described
above.        During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company changed the source of its
credit spreads from those observed in the credit default swap market to those
observed in the bond market. Had this modification been in place since the
beginning of 2008, the change in the Company s own credit spread would have
resulted in a gain of $2.49 billion and a gain of $2.02 billion for the three
and twelve months ended December 31, 2008, respectively. See also Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company s
correction of an error in the calculation of CVA for prior
periods. 

The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities  

Selected portfolios of securities purchased under agreements to resell,
securities borrowed, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities
loaned and certain non-collateralized short-term
borrowings     The
Company elected the fair value option retrospectively for our United States and
United Kingdom portfolios of fixed-income securities purchased under agreements
to resell and fixed-income securities sold under agreements to repurchase (and
certain non-collateralized short-term borrowings). The fair value option was
also elected prospectively in the second quarter of 2007 for certain portfolios
of fixed-income securities lending and borrowing transactions based in Japan. In
each case, the election was made because the related interest-rate risk is
managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with derivative instruments that are
accounted for at fair value through earnings. Previously, these positions were
accounted for on an accrual basis. 

               Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded
in    Principal transactions   . The related interest revenue and interest
expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the
transactions and are reported as interest revenue and expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Legg Mason convertible preferred equity
securities       The
Legg Mason convertible preferred equity securities (Legg shares) were acquired
in connection with the sale of Citigroup s Asset Management business in December
2005. Prior to the election of fair value option accounting, the shares were
classified as available-for-sale securities with the unrealized loss of $232
million as of December 31, 2006 included in    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   .
This unrealized loss was recorded upon election of a fair value as a reduction
of January 1, 2007    Retained earnings        as
part of the cumulative-effect adjustment.
           During the first quarter of
2008, the Company sold the remaining 8.4 million Legg shares at a pretax loss of
$10.3 million ($6.7 million after-tax).   

Selected letters of credit and revolving loans hedged by credit default
swaps or participation notes     The Company has elected the fair value option
for certain letters of credit that are hedged with derivative instruments or
participation notes. Upon electing the fair value option, the related portions
of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded lending
commitments were reversed. Citigroup elected the fair value option for these
transactions because the risk is managed on a fair value basis and mitigates
accounting mismatches.         The notional amount of these unfunded letters
of credit was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $1.4 billion as of
December 31, 2008. The amount funded was insignificant with no amounts 90 days
or more past due or on a non-accrual status at December 31, 2009 and
2008.         These items have been classified in
   Trading account assets    or    Trading account liabilities    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of these items
are classified in    Principal transactions    in the Company s Consolidated Statement of
Income.  

Certain credit products      Citigroup has elected the fair value option
for certain originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan
products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup s
trading businesses. None of these credit products is a highly leveraged
financing commitment. Significant groups of transactions include loans and
unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the
near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative
instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where
the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party.
Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in
cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational
simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across
the Company, including where those management objectives would not be
met. 

236  

The following table
provides information about certain credit products carried at fair
value: 

(1)         
             
                Reclassified
      to conform to current period s
presentation. 

In addition to the amounts reported above, $200 million and $72 million
of unfunded loan commitments related to certain credit products selected for
fair value accounting were outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.           Changes in fair value of funded and unfunded
credit products are classified in    Principal transactions    in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest
revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported
as    Interest revenue    on trading account assets or loans depending
on their balance sheet classifications. The changes in fair value for the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled
to a gain of $5.9 billion and a loss of $6.0 billion,
respectively. 

Certain hybrid financial instruments     The Company has elected to apply fair value
accounting for certain hybrid financial assets and liabilities whose performance
is linked to risks other than interest rate, foreign exchange or inflation
(e.g., equity, credit or commodity risks). In addition, the Company has elected
fair value accounting for residual interests retained from securitizing certain
financial assets.           The Company has elected fair value accounting
for these instruments because these exposures are considered to be
trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. In
addition, the accounting for these instruments is simplified under a fair value
approach as it eliminates the complicated operational requirements of
bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for
each separately. The hybrid financial instruments are classified as    Trading account assets, Loans   ,    Deposits   ,
   Trading account liabilitie   s (for prepaid derivatives),    Short-term borrowings    or    Long-term debt    on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet
according to their legal form, while residual interests in certain
securitizations are classified as    Trading account assets   .         For hybrid
financial instruments for which fair value accounting has been elected and that
are classified as    Long-term debt   , the aggregate unpaid principal exceeded the
aggregate fair value by $3.4 billion and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively. The difference for those instruments classified as
   Loans    is immaterial.    

Changes in fair value
for hybrid financial instruments, which in most cases includes a component for
accrued interest, are recorded in   Principal transactions    in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income.
Interest accruals for certain hybrid instruments classified as trading assets
are recorded separately from the change in fair value as     Interest revenue    in
the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Certain investments in private
equity and real estate ventures and certain equity method
investments    Citigroup invests
in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment
returns and for capital appreciation. The Company has elected the fair value
option for certain of these ventures, because such investments are considered
similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in our investment
companies, which are reported at fair value. The fair value option brings
consistency in the accounting and evaluation of certain of these investments.
All investments (debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate
entities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are classified
as    Investments      on Citigroup s Consolidated Balance
Sheet.         Citigroup also holds various non-strategic
investments in leveraged buyout funds and other hedge funds that previously were
required to be accounted for under the equity method. The Company elected fair
value accounting to reduce operational and accounting complexity. Since the
funds account for all of their underlying assets at fair value, the impact of
applying the equity method to Citigroup s investment in these funds was
equivalent to fair value accounting. Thus, this fair value election had no
impact on opening     Retained earnings   .
These investments are classified as    Other assets    on
Citigroup s Consolidated Balance Sheet.         Changes in the fair values of these
investments are classified in    Other revenue    in
the Company s Consolidated Statement of
Income. 

237  

Certain mortgage loans     Citigroup has elected the fair value option
for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming
adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held-for-sale. These loans are intended for
sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments. The Company
has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases
where hedge 

accounting is complex
and to achieve operational simplifications. The fair value option was not
elected for loans held-for-investment, as those loans are not hedged with
derivative instruments. 

The following table provides information about
certain mortgage loans carried at fair value: 

The changes in fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in
   Other revenue    in the Company s Consolidated Statement of
Income. The changes in fair value during the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008 due to instrument-specific credit risk resulted in a $10 million loss and
$32 million loss, respectively. Related interest income continues to be measured
based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. 

Mortgage servicing rights     The Company accounts for mortgage servicing
rights (MSRs) at fair value. Fair value for MSRs is determined using an
option-adjusted spread valuation approach. This approach consists of projecting
servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting
these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates. The model assumptions used in the
valuation of MSRs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates. The
fair value of MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result
from shifts in mortgage interest rates. In managing this risk, the Company
hedges a significant portion of the values of its MSRs through the use of
interest-rate derivative contracts, forward-purchase commitments of
mortgage-backed securities, and purchased securities classified as trading. See
Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions
regarding the accounting and reporting of MSRs.           These MSRs, which totaled $6.5 billion and
$5.7 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are classified as
   Mortgage servicing rights    on Citigroup s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Changes in fair value of MSRs are recorded in    Commissions and fees    in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Certain structured liabilities     The Company has elected the fair value option
for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured
interest rates, inflation or currency risks ( structured liabilities ). The
Company elected the fair value option, because these exposures are considered to
be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis.
These positions will continue to be classified
as 

debt, deposits or
derivatives (  Trading account liabilities   ) on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet
according to their legal form.           For those structured liabilities classified
as    Long-term debt    for which the fair value option has been
elected, the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair
value by $125 million and $671 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.           The change in fair value for these structured
liabilities is reported in    Principal transactions    in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income.         Related interest expense is measured
based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated
Income Statement.   

Certain non-structured liabilities     The Company has elected the fair value option
for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates
( non-structured liabilities ). The Company has elected the fair value option
where the interest-rate risk of such liabilities is economically hedged with
derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that
will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings. The election has been
made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational
simplifications. These positions are reported in    Short-term borrowings    and    Long-term debt    on the Company s Consolidated Balance
Sheet.           For those non-structured liabilities
classified as    Short-term borrowings    for which the fair value option has been
elected, the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair
value of such instruments by $220 million as of December 31, 2008.          For non-structured liabilities classified as
   Long-term debt    for which the fair value option has been
elected, the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair
value by $1,542 million and $856 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The change in fair value for these non-structured liabilities is
reported in    Principal transactions    in the Company s Consolidated Statement of
Income.           Related interest expense continues to be
measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the
Consolidated Income Statement.

28. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  

Estimated Fair Value of Financial
Instruments    The table
below presents the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup s financial
instruments. The disclosure excludes leases, affiliate investments, pension and
benefit obligations and insurance policy claim reserves. In addition,
contract-holder fund amounts exclude certain insurance contracts. Also as
required, the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount
that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a
particular instrument, excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed
maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In
addition, the table excludes the values of non-financial assets and liabilities,
as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship and intangible values (but
includes mortgage servicing rights), which are integral to a full assessment of
Citigroup s financial position and the value of its net assets.
        The fair value represents management s best estimates based on a range of
methodologies and assumptions. The carrying value of short-term financial
instruments not accounted for at fair value, as well as receivables and payables
arising in the ordinary course of business, approximates fair value because of
the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected
realization. Quoted market prices are used when available for investments and
for both trading and end-user derivatives, as well as for liabilities, such as
long-term debt, with quoted prices. For performing loans not accounted for at
fair value, contractual cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market
rates or estimated market rates if available. Otherwise, sales of comparable
loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms
and risk characteristics are used. For loans with doubt as to collectability,
expected cash flows are discounted using an appropriate rate considering the
time of collection and the premium for the uncertainty of the cash flows. This
method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price concept of
fair value prescribed by ASC 820-10 (SFAS No. 157). The value of collateral is
also considered. For liabilities such as long-term debt not accounted for at
fair value and without quoted market prices, market borrowing rates of interest
are used to discount contractual cash flows.  

(1)         
              The carrying
      value of loans is net of the    Allowance for loan losses
         of $36.0
      billion for 2009 and $29.6 billion for 2008. In addition, the carrying
      values exclude $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion of lease finance receivables
      in 2009 and 2008, respectively.  
            
              (2)  
              Includes
      cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables,
      reinsurance recoverable, mortgage servicing rights, separate and variable
      accounts and other financial instruments included in    Other assets    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
      for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair
      value.  
            
              (3)  
              Includes
      brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, short-term borrowings
      and other financial instruments included in    Other liabilities
         on the
      Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a
      reasonable estimate of fair value.  

Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range
of factors, including interest rates, credit quality, and market perceptions of
value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are
entered into.           The estimated fair values of loans reflect
changes in credit status since the loans were made, changes in interest rates in
the case of fixed-rate loans, and premium values at origination of certain
loans. The carrying values (reduced by the    Allowance for loan losses   ) exceeded the estimated fair values of Citigroup s loans, in aggregate,
by $9.7 billion and by $18.2 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December
31, 2009, the carrying values, net of allowances, exceeded the estimated values
by $8.2 billion and $1.5 billion for consumer loans and corporate loans,
respectively.        The estimated
fair values of the Company s corporate unfunded lending commitments at December
31, 2009 and 2008 were liabilities of $3.3 billion and $7.1 billion,
respectively. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded
lending commitments, which are generally cancellable by providing notice to the
borrower. 

239  

29. PLEDGED ASSETS, COLLATERAL,
COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES  

Pledged Assets    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the approximate
fair values of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other assets
pledged, excluding the impact of allowable netting, were as follows:

In addition, included in cash and due from banks at December 31, 2009 and
2008 are $11.2 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively, of cash segregated under
federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing
organizations.           At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had
$1.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit
from third-party banks to satisfy various collateral and margin requirements.

Collateral    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the approximate
market value of collateral received by the Company that may be sold or repledged
by the Company, excluding amounts netted was $346.2 billion and $340.2 billion,
respectively. This collateral was received in connection with resale agreements,
securities borrowings and loans, derivative transactions and margined broker
loans.           At December 31, 2009 and 2008, a substantial
portion of the collateral received by the Company had been sold or repledged in
connection with repurchase agreements, securities sold, not yet purchased,
securities borrowings and loans, pledges to clearing organizations, segregation
requirements under securities laws and regulations, derivative transactions and
bank loans.  

In addition, at December 31, 2009
and 2008, the Company had pledged $253 billion and $236 billion, respectively,
of collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties.

Lease Commitments    Rental expense (principally for offices and
computer equipment) was $2.0 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.           Future minimum annual rentals under
noncancelable leases, net of sublease income, are as follows:  

Guarantees    The Company provides a variety of guarantees
and indemnifications to Citigroup customers to enhance their credit standing and
enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions. For certain
contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize,
at inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee.         In addition, the guarantor must disclose the
maximum potential amount of future payments the guarantor could be required to
make under the guarantee, if there were a total default by the guaranteed
parties. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on
the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible
recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. Such
amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these
guarantees. 

(1)         
              The carrying
      values of guarantees of collections of contractual cash flows, securities
      lending indemnifications and credit card merchant processing are not
      material, as the Company has determined that the amount and probability of
      potential liabilities arising from these guarantees are not
      significant.

              The carrying
      values of guarantees of collections of contractual cash flows, securities
      lending indemnifications and credit card merchant processing are not
      material, as the Company has determined that the amount and probability of
      potential liabilities arising from these guarantees are not
      significant.  
            
              (2)  
              Reclassified
      to conform to the current period s
presentation.  

Financial standby letters of credit     Citigroup issues standby letters of credit
which substitute its own credit for that of the borrower. If a letter of credit
is drawn down, the borrower is obligated to repay Citigroup. Standby letters of
credit protect a third party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial
standby letters of credit include guarantees of payment of insurance premiums
and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting and
settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses, and also support options
and purchases of securities or are in lieu of escrow deposit accounts. Financial
standbys also backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade
acceptances.  

Performance guarantees     Performance guarantees and letters of credit
are issued to guarantee a customer s tender bid on a construction or
systems-installation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in
accordance with contract terms. They are also issued to support a customer s
obligation to supply specified products, commodities, or maintenance or warranty
services to a third party.  

Derivative instruments considered to be
guarantees     Derivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a
notional amount or an underlying instrument, where there is little or no initial
investment, and whose terms require or permit net settlement. Derivatives may be
used for a variety of reasons, including risk management, or to enhance returns.
Financial institutions often act as intermediaries for their clients, helping
clients reduce their risks. However, derivatives may also be used to take a risk
position.         The derivative instruments considered to be
guarantees, which are presented in the tables above, include only those
instruments that require Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on
changes in an underlying that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity
security held by the guaranteed party. More specifically, derivative instruments
considered to be guarantees include certain over-the-counter written put options
where the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-dealer (such
counterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets, and may therefore
not hold the 

underlying instruments).
However, credit derivatives sold by the Company are excluded from this
presentation, as they are disclosed separately within this note below. In
addition, non-credit derivative contracts that are cash settled and for which
the Company is unable to assert that it is probable the counterparty held the
underlying instrument at the inception of the contract also are excluded from
the disclosure above.           In instances where the Company s maximum
potential future payment is unlimited, the notional amount of the contract is
disclosed.  

Guarantees of collection of contractual cash
flows     Guarantees
of collection of contractual cash flows protect investors in credit card
receivables securitization trusts from loss of interest relating to insufficient
collections on the underlying receivables in the trusts. The notional amount of
these guarantees as of December 31, 2008 was $300 million. No such guarantees
were outstanding as of December 31, 2009.  

Loans sold with recourse     Loans sold with recourse represent the
Company s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain
circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a
lender will fully reimburse the buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the
purchased loans. This may be accomplished by the seller s taking back any loans
that become delinquent.  

Securities lending indemnifications     Owners of securities frequently lend those
securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them short or deliver them to
another party to satisfy some other obligation. Banks may administer such
securities lending programs for their clients. Securities lending
indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending
customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not
return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is
insufficient to cover the market value of the security.  

241  

Credit card merchant processing     Credit card merchant processing guarantees
represent the Company s indirect obligations in connection with the processing
of private label and bankcard transactions on behalf of
merchants.         Citigroup s primary credit card business is
the issuance of credit cards to individuals. In addition, the Company provides
transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to bankcard
and private-label cards. In the event of a billing dispute with respect to a
bankcard transaction between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately
resolved in the cardholder s favor, the third party holds the primary contingent
liability to credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and charge back the
transaction to the merchant. If the third party is unable to collect this amount
from the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid
to the cardholder.         The Company continues to have the primary
contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private-label merchants.
The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between the third party or the
Company and the merchant are settled on a net basis and the third party or the
Company has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to
the merchant. To further mitigate this risk, the third party or the Company may
require a merchant to make an escrow deposit, delay settlement, or include event
triggers to provide the third party or the Company with more financial and
operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant,
or require various credit enhancements (including letters of credit and bank
guarantees). In the unlikely event that a private-label merchant is unable to
deliver products, services or a refund to its private-label cardholders,
Citigroup is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders. In addition,
although a third party holds the primary contingent liability with respect to
the processing of bankcard transactions, in the event that the third party does
not have sufficient collateral from the merchant or sufficient financial
resources of its own to provide the credit or refunds to the cardholders,
Citigroup would be liable to credit or refund the
cardholders.         The Company s maximum potential contingent
liability related to both bankcard and private-label merchant processing
services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that
meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time. At
December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, this maximum potential exposure was
estimated to be $60 billion and $57 billion,
respectively.         However, the Company believes that the maximum
exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on
the Company s historical experience and its position as a secondary guarantor
(in the case of bankcards). In most cases, this contingent liability is unlikely
to arise,  

as most products and
services are delivered when purchased, and amounts are refunded when items are
returned to merchants. The Company assesses the probability and amount of its
contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial
strength of the primary guarantor (in the case of bankcards) and the extent and
nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience. At December
31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the estimated losses incurred and the carrying
amounts of the Company s contingent obligations related to merchant processing
activities were immaterial.  

Custody indemnifications     Custody indemnifications are issued to
guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a
third-party subcustodian or depository institution fails to safeguard clients 
assets.  

Other     As
of December 31, 2008, Citigroup carried a reserve of $149 million related to
certain of Visa USA s litigation matters. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying
value of the reserve was $121 million and was included in    Other liabilities   
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Other guarantees and indemnifications     The Company, through its credit card business,
provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products,
including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for
certain losses associated with purchased products, price protection for certain
purchases and protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in
the table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and the
Company s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is
limited to certain types of purchases and certain types of losses and it is not
possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any
given time. The Company assesses the probability and amount of its potential
liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its
historical loss experience. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the actual and
estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of the Company s obligations
related to these programs were
immaterial.         In the normal course of business, the Company
provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts
in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications that
protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes
are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of
the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide the Company with
comparable indemnifications. While such representations, warranties

242  

and tax indemnifications
are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not
represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions. The
indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to the
Company s own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in
the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is
remote. Often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are
met at inception (for example, that loans transferred to a counterparty in a
sales transaction did in fact meet the conditions specified in the contract at
the transfer date). No compensation is received for these standard
representations and warranties, and it is not possible to determine their fair
value because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many cases, there
are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and
the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not
occurred and are not expected to occur. These indemnifications are not
included in the table above.        In addition, the Company is a member of or
shareholder in hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment clearing and
settlement systems as well as securities exchanges) around the world. As a
condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to
backstop the net effect on the VTNs of a member s default on its obligations.
The Company s potential obligations as a shareholder or member of VTN
associations are excluded from the scope of FIN 45, since the shareholders and
members represent subordinated classes of investors in the VTNs. Accordingly,
the Company s participation in VTNs is not reported in the table and there are
no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009
or December 31, 2008 for potential obligations that could arise from the
Company s involvement with VTN
associations.         In the sale of an insurance subsidiary, the
Company provided an indemnification to an insurance company for policyholder
claims and other liabilities relating to a book of long-term care (LTC) business
(for the entire term of the LTC policies) that is fully reinsured by another
insurance company. The reinsurer has funded two trusts with securities whose
fair value (approximately $3.3 billion at December 31, 2009) is designed to
cover the insurance company s statutory liabilities for the LTC policies. The
assets in these trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that
the fair value of the assets continues to cover the estimated statutory
liabilities related to the LTC policies, as those statutory liabilities change
over time. If the reinsurer fails to perform under the reinsurance agreement for
any reason, including insolvency, and the assets in the two trusts are
insufficient or unavailable to the ceding insurance company, then Citigroup must
indemnify the ceding insurance company for any losses actually incurred in
connection with the LTC policies. Since both events would have to occur before
Citi would become responsible for any payment to the ceding insurance company
pursuant to its indemnification obligation and the  

likelihood of such
events occurring is currently not probable, there is no liability reflected in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 related to this
indemnification.         At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and
indemnifications included in the table amounted to approximately $1.2 billion
and $1.8 billion, respectively. The carrying value of derivative instruments is
included in either    Trading liabilities   
or    Other liabilities   , depending upon whether the derivative was
entered into for trading or non-trading purposes. The carrying value of
financial and performance guarantees is included in    Other liabilities   .
For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in
   Other liabilities   . In addition, at December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008,    Other liabilities   
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet include an allowance for credit losses of
$1,157 million and $887 million relating to letters of credit and unfunded
lending commitments, respectively.  

Collateral     Cash collateral available to the Company to reimburse losses realized
under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $31 billion and $33
billion at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Securities and
other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $43 billion and $27
billion, respectively, the majority of which collateral is held to reimburse
losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. Additionally, letters
of credit in favor of the Company held as collateral amounted to $1.4 billion
and $0.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Other
property may also be available to the Company to cover losses under certain
guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not
been determined.  

Performance risk     Citigroup evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the
assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings. Where external
ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB and
above, while anything below is considered non-investment grade. The Citigroup
internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system. On certain
underlying referenced credits or entities, ratings are not available. Such
referenced credits are included in the  not rated  category. The
maximum potential amount of the future payments related to guarantees and credit
derivatives sold is determined to be the notional amount of these contracts,
which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed.  

243  

Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future
payments classified based upon internal and external credit ratings as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008. As previously mentioned, the determination of the
maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount

of the guarantees
without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from
collateral held or pledged. Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated
losses, if any, on these guarantees. 

244  

Credit Commitments and Lines of
Credit  

      The table below
summarizes Citigroup s credit commitments as of December 31, 2009 and December
31, 2008: 

The majority of
unused commitments are contingent upon customers  maintaining specific credit
standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and
fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of
certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment,
amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized
over the commitment period. 

Commercial and similar letters of credit   

        A commercial letter of
credit is an instrument by which Citigroup substitutes its credit for that of a
customer to enable the customer to finance the purchase of goods or to incur
other commitments. Citigroup issues a letter on behalf of its client to a
supplier and agrees to pay the supplier upon presentation of documentary
evidence that the supplier has performed in accordance with the terms of the
letter of credit. When a letter of credit is drawn, the customer is then
required to reimburse Citigroup. 

One- to four-family residential mortgages   

        A one- to four-family residential
mortgage commitment is a written confirmation from Citigroup to a seller of a
property that the bank will advance the specified sums enabling the buyer to
complete the purchase. 

Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential
properties   

        Revolving open-end loans secured by
one- to four-family residential properties are essentially home equity lines of
credit. A home equity line of credit is a loan secured by a primary residence or
second home to the extent of the excess of fair market value over the debt
outstanding for the first mortgage. 

Commercial real estate, construction and land
development   

        Commercial real estate,
construction and land development include unused portions of commitments to
extend credit for the purpose of financing commercial and multifamily
residential properties as well as land development projects. Both
secured-by-real-estate and unsecured commitments are included in this line, as
well as undistributed loan proceeds, where there is an obligation to advance for
construction progress payments. However, this line only includes those
extensions of credit that, once funded, will be classified as    Total loans, net    on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Credit card lines   

        Citigroup provides
credit to customers by issuing credit cards. The credit card lines are
unconditionally cancellable by the issuer. 

Commercial and other consumer loan commitments   

        Commercial and other
consumer loan commitments include overdraft and liquidity facilities, as well as
commercial commitments to make or purchase loans, to purchase third-party
receivables, to provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities and
to invest in the form of equity. Amounts include $126 billion and $170 billion
with an original maturity of less than one year at December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. In addition, included in this line item are
highly leveraged financing commitments, which are agreements that provide
funding to a borrower with higher levels of debt (measured by the ratio of debt
capital to equity capital of the borrower) than is generally considered normal
for other companies. This type of financing is commonly employed in corporate
acquisitions, management buy-outs and similar transactions. 

245  

30. CONTINGENCIES   

        As described in  Legal
Proceedings,  Citigroup and its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and
former officers, directors and employees have been named, and routinely are
named in the ordinary course of business, as defendants in, or as parties to,
various legal actions and proceedings.  In accordance with ASC 450
(formerly SFAS 5), Citigroup establishes reserves for litigation and regulatory
matters when those matters present loss contingencies that both are probable and
can be reasonably estimated.  In view of the inherent unpredictability of
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where the damages sought are
substantial or indeterminate, the investigations or proceedings are in the early
stages, or the matters involve novel legal theories or a large number of
parties, Citigroup cannot state with certainty the timing or ultimate resolution
of litigations and regulatory matters, and the actual costs of resolving
litigations and regulatory matters may be substantially higher or lower than the
amounts reserved for those matters. 

Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion
of Citigroup s management, based on current knowledge and after taking into
account available insurance coverage and its current legal reserves, that the
eventual outcome of such matters, including the matters described in  Legal
Proceedings,  would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial condition of Citi.  Nonetheless, given the
substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the
inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of
these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citi s
consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or
annual periods.

32. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

LQIF Acquisition  

        On January 31, 2010
Citigroup elected to exercise its option to acquire approximately 8.5% of LQIF
for approximately $500 million. The acquisition of the additional shares is
expected to close on April 30, 2010 and will increase Citigroup s ownership in
LQIF to approximately 41.5%. Citigroup retains an option to increase its
ownership an additional 8.5% of LQIF in 2010 for an additional $500
million. 

Venezuelan Bolivar
Devaluation  

        The Venezuelan
government enacted currency restrictions in 2003 that have restricted
Citigroup s ability to obtain foreign currency in Venezuela at the official
foreign currency rate. Citigroup uses the official rate to remeasure the foreign
currency transactions in the financial statements of our Venezuelan
subsidiaries, which have U.S. dollar functional currencies, into U.S. dollars.
At December 31, 2009, Citigroup had net monetary assets denominated in bolivars
and subject to the official rate of approximately $290 million. 

              On January 8, 2010,
the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the official foreign
currency exchange rate from 2.15 bolivars per dollar to 4.3 bolivars per dollar
and the creation of a dual, subsidized exchange rate of 2.6 bolivars per dollar
for the importation of certain essential goods. The devaluation in the rate is
expected to result in a pretax loss to the Company of approximately $170 million
in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally, revenue and net operating profit in
U.S. dollar terms will be reduced on an ongoing basis. 

              The Company has
evaluated subsequent events through February 26, 2010, which is the date its
Consolidated Financial Statements were issued.

34. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA
(UNAUDITED)  

This Note to the
Consolidated Financial Statements is unaudited due to the Company s individual
quarterly results not being subject to an audit. 

(1)  
                       
              The revenue and (after-tax impact) of the Company s correction
      of a CVA error in prior periods, which reduced revenues and net
      income in the fourth quarter of 2009 by $840 million ($518 million),
      respectively, related to the quarters in 2008 and 2009 as follows: $7
      million ($4 million), $58 million ($36 million), $97 million ($60
      million), $44 million ($27 million), for the first, second, third and
      fourth quarters of 2008, respectively, and $198 million ($122 million),
      $115 million ($71 million) and $197 million ($121 million) for the first,
      second and third quarters of 2009, respectively. See also Note 1 to the
      Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of this CVA error was
      determined not to be material to the Company s results of operations and
      financial position for any previously reported period. Consequently, in
      the accompanying selected quarterly financial data, the cumulative effect
      through September 30, 2009 is recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.

(2)  
                 
              Due to averaging of shares, quarterly earnings per share may not
      add up to the totals reported for the full year.  
            
              (3)  
                 
              Diluted shares are equal to basic shares for all four quarters of
      2008 and the first, third and fourth quarter of 2009 due to the net loss
      available to common shareholders. Adding additional shares to the
      denominator would result in
anti-dilution.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  

Proposed
Legislation    In addition
to the regulations and requirements discussed below, legislation is from time to
time introduced in Congress that may change banking statutes and the operating
environment of Citigroup and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable
ways. This has been particularly true as a result of the financial crisis
beginning in late 2007. See  Risk Factors,  above. Citigroup cannot determine
whether any such proposed legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the
ultimate effect that any such potential legislation or implementing regulations
would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of Citigroup or
its subsidiaries. 

Bank Holding Company/Financial Holding
Company    Citigroup s
ownership of Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) and other banks makes Citigroup a  bank
holding company  within the meaning of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of
1956.        Bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking,
managing or controlling banks, and other closely related activities. Citigroup
is qualified as a  financial holding company,  which permits Citi to engage in a
broader range of financial activities in the U.S. and abroad. These activities
include underwriting and dealing in securities, insurance underwriting and
brokerage, and making investments in non-financial companies for a limited
period of time, as long as Citi does not manage the non-financial company s
day-to-day activities, and its banking subsidiaries engage only in permitted
cross-marketing with the non-financial company. If Citigroup ceases to qualify
as a financial holding company, it could be barred from new financial activities
or acquisitions, and have to discontinue the broader range of activities
permitted to financial holding companies.  

Regulators    As a bank holding company, Citigroup is
regulated and supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(FRB). Nationally chartered subsidiary banks, such as Citibank, are regulated
and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); federal
savings associations by the Office of Thrift Supervision; and state-chartered
depository institutions by state banking departments and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC has back-up enforcement authority for
banking subsidiaries whose deposits it insures. Overseas branches of Citibank
are regulated and supervised by the FRB and OCC and overseas subsidiary banks by
the FRB. Such overseas branches and subsidiary banks are also regulated and
supervised by regulatory authorities in the host countries. 

Internal Growth and
Acquisitions    Unless
otherwise required by the FRB, financial holding companies generally can engage,
directly or indirectly in the U.S. and abroad, in financial activities, either
de novo or by acquisition, by providing after-the-fact notice to the FRB.
However, all bank holding companies, including Citigroup, must obtain the prior
approval of the FRB before acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting stock
of a U.S. depository institution or bank holding
company.        Subject to certain restrictions and the prior
approval of the appropriate federal banking regulatory agency, Citi can acquire
U.S. depository institutions, including out-of-state banks. In addition,
intrastate bank mergers are permitted and banks in states that do not prohibit
out-of-state mergers may merge. A national or state bank can establish a new
branch in another state if permitted by the other state, and a federal savings
association can generally open new branches in any
state.         The FRB must approve certain additional
capital contributions to an existing non-U.S. investment and certain
acquisitions by Citigroup of an interest in a non-U.S. company, including in a
foreign bank, as well as the establishment by Citibank of foreign branches in
certain circumstances. 

Dividends    Citi s bank holding companies and banking
subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends. See Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to specific limitations on the
dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies, federal
regulators could prohibit a dividend that would be an unsafe or unsound banking
practice. Further, pursuant to the various agreements Citigroup entered into
with the U.S. government during late 2008 and 2009, Citigroup is prohibited from
paying a dividend of more than $0.01 per share per quarter generally so long as
the U.S. Treasury or FDIC continue to hold any common stock or trust preferred
securities of Citigroup issued pursuant to Citi s exchange
offers.        It is FRB policy that bank holding companies should generally pay
dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and
only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s
expected future needs and financial condition. In December 2009, the FRB advised
bank holding companies to consult with FRB staff before increasing dividends or
taking other actions that could diminish the bank holding company s capital
base. Moreover, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that
undermine the company s ability to be a source of strength to its banking
subsidiaries.  

259  

Transactions with Non-Bank
Subsidiaries    A banking
subsidiary s transactions with a holding company or non-bank subsidiary
generally are limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary s capital stock and
surplus, with an aggregate limit of 20% of the banking subsidiary s capital
stock and surplus for all such transactions. Such transactions must be on
arm s-length terms, and certain credit transactions must be fully secured by
approved forms of collateral. 

Liquidation    Citigroup s right to participate in the
distribution of assets of a subsidiary upon the subsidiary s liquidation will be
subordinate to the claims of the subsidiary s creditors. If the subsidiary is an
insured depository institution, Citi s claim as a stockholder or creditor will
be subordinated to the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated
creditors.         In the liquidation of a U.S.-insured
depository institution, deposits in U.S. offices and certain claims for
administrative expenses and employee compensation will have priority over other
general unsecured claims, including deposits in offices outside the U.S.,
non-deposit claims in all offices, and claims of a parent such as Citigroup. The
FDIC, which succeeds to the position of insured depositors, would be a priority
creditor.        An FDIC-insured financial institution that is
affiliated with a failed FDIC-insured institution may have to indemnify the FDIC
for losses resulting from the insolvency of the failed institution, even if this
causes the indemnifying institution also to become insolvent. Obligations of a
subsidiary depository institution to a parent company are subordinate to the
subsidiary s indemnity liability and the claims of its depositors.  

Other Bank and Bank Holding Company
Regulation    Citigroup
and its banking subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory limitations,
including requirements for banks to maintain reserves against deposits;
requirements as to risk-based capital and leverage (see  Capital Resources and
Liquidity  above and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);
restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest
that may be charged; and limitations on investments that can be made and
services that can be offered.        The FRB may also expect Citigroup to commit
resources to its subsidiary banks in certain circumstances. However, the FRB may
not compel a bank holding company to remove capital from its regulated
securities and insurance subsidiaries for this
purpose.        A U.S. bank is not required to repay a deposit
at a branch outside the U.S. if the branch cannot repay the deposit due to an
act of war, civil strife, or action taken by the government in the host country.

Privacy and Data
Security    Under U.S.
federal law, Citigroup must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit
consumers to  opt out  of having non-public customer information disclosed to
third parties, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing
solicitations based on information about the customer received from another
subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy
protections.        Citigroup is similarly required to have an
information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of
customer information and to ensure its proper disposal and to notify customers
of unauthorized disclosure, consistent with applicable law or regulation.

Non-U.S.
Regulation    A
substantial portion of Citigroup s revenues is derived from its operations
outside the U.S., which are subject to the local laws and regulations of the
host country. Those requirements affect how the local activities are organized
and the manner in which they are conducted. Citi s foreign activities are thus
subject to both U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and
supervision, including U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in
certain countries. 

Securities
Regulation    Certain of
Citigroup s subsidiaries are subject to various securities and commodities
regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and
exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they
operate.         Subsidiaries  registrations include as
broker-dealers and as investment advisers with the SEC and as futures commission
merchants and as commodity pool operators with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC).   Citigroup s
primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), is
registered as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto
Rico, Taiwan and Guam. CGMI is also a primary dealer in U.S. Treasury securities
and a member of the principal United States futures exchanges. CGMI is subject
to extensive regulation, including minimum capital requirements, which are
promulgated and enforced by their Designated Examining Authority, the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
various other self-regulatory organizations of which CGMI is a member.
  The SEC and the CFTC also require certain registered
broker-dealers (including CGMI) to maintain records concerning certain financial
and securities activities of affiliated companies that may be material to the
broker-dealer, and to file certain financial and other information regarding
such affiliated companies.  

260  

Citigroup s securities operations abroad are conducted through various
subsidiaries and affiliates, principally Citigroup Global Markets Limited in
London and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. in Tokyo. Its securities
activities in the United Kingdom, which include investment banking, trading, and
brokerage services, are subject to the Financial Services and Markets Act of
2000, which regulates organizations that conduct investment businesses in the
United Kingdom including capital and liquidity requirements, and to the rules of
the Financial Services Authority. Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. is a
registered securities company in Japan, and as such its activities in Japan are
regulated principally by the Financial Services Agency of Japan. These and other
subsidiaries of Citigroup are also members of various securities and commodities
exchanges and are subject to the rules and regulations of those exchanges.
Citigroup s other offices abroad are also subject to the jurisdiction of foreign
financial services regulatory
authorities.         CGMI is a member of the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for customers of a
broker-dealer against losses in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer.
SIPC protects customers  securities accounts held by a broker-dealer up to
$500,000 for each eligible customer, subject to a limitation of $100,000 for
claims for cash balances. To supplement this SIPC coverage, CGMI has purchased
additional protection for the benefit of its customers, subject to an aggregate
loss limit of $600 million and a per client cash loss limit of up to $1.9
million.  

Capital
Requirements     As
a registered broker-dealer, CGMI is subject to Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC (the Net
Capital Rule). Under the Net Capital Rule, CGMI is required to maintain minimum
net capital  based on the greater of the SEC or CFTC minimum net capital
requirement  equal to 2% of aggregate debit items, as defined.  Under
NYSE regulations, CGMI may be required to reduce its business if its net capital
is less than 4% of aggregate debit items and may also be prohibited from
expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital would
be less than 5% of aggregate debit items.  Furthermore, the Net Capital
Rule does not permit withdrawal of equity or subordinated capital if the
resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debit
items.  

             CGMI was approved by the SEC to compute net capital in accordance with
the provisions of Appendix E of Rule 15c3-1. This methodology allows CGMI to
compute market risk capital charges using internal value-at-risk models. Under
Appendix E, CGMI is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1
billion and net capital in excess of $500 million. The firm is also required to
notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5
billion.        Compliance with
the Net Capital Rule could limit those operations of CGMI that require the
intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities and the
financing of customer account balances, and  also limits the ability of
broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and
other affiliates.  

CUSTOMERS    In Citigroup s judgment, no material part of
Citigroup s business depends upon a single customer or group of customers, the
loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on Citi, and no one
customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for as much as 10% of
Citigroup s consolidated revenues.  

261  

COMPETITION    The financial services industry, including
each of Citigroup s businesses, is highly competitive. Citigroup s competitors
include a variety of other financial services and advisory companies such as
banks, thrifts, credit unions, credit card issuers, mortgage banking companies,
trust companies, investment banking companies, brokerage firms, investment
advisory companies, hedge funds, private equity funds, securities processing
companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, automobile financing
companies, and Internet-based financial services
companies.        Citigroup competes for clients with some of
these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product basis.
Increased competition may create pressure to lower prices on our products and
services and affect market share. Our competitive position depends on many
factors, including brand name, reputation, the types of clients, industries and
geographies served, the quality, range, performance, innovation and pricing of
products and services, the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels,
technology advances, customer service and convenience, effectiveness of
transaction execution, interest rates and lending limits, regulatory
constraints, the talent of our employees and the effectiveness of advertising
and sales promotion efforts.        In recent years, Citigroup has experienced
intense price competition in some of its businesses. For example, the increased
pressure on trading commissions from growing direct access to automated,
electronic markets may continue to impact    Securities and Banking   , and technological advances that enable more companies to provide funds
transfers may diminish the importance of    Regional Consumer Banking    s role as a financial intermediary. Citigroup also faces intense
competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees, and its ability to
compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and
retain and sufficiently motivate existing employees, while managing compensation
and other costs. See  Risk Factors 
above.        An increasingly global financial services industry has seen substantial
consolidation among companies, particularly during the recent credit crisis,
through mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies. In addition, as a result of the
recent credit crisis, certain investment banks and other entities became bank
holding companies and/or financial holding companies. This consolidation may
produce larger, better capitalized and more geographically diverse competitors
able to offer a wider array of products and services at more competitive prices
around the world. Additionally, some of Citigroup s competitors may face fewer
regulatory constraints resulting in lower cost structures and increased
operating flexibility. In certain geographic regions, including  emerging
markets,  our competitors may have a stronger local presence, longer operating
histories, and more established relationships with clients and
regulators.         Citigroup also actively competes for access to
capital at competitive rates to fund its operations, including competition for
deposits and funding in the short- and long-term debt
markets. 

PROPERTIES     Citigroup s principal executive offices are
located at 399 Park Avenue in New York City. Citigroup, and certain of its
subsidiaries, is the largest tenant of this building. Citigroup also has

each totaling 257,000 rentable square feet. The building is owned by Banamex.
Banamex has office and branch sites throughout
Mexico.         Citigroup owns or leases over 82.2 million
square feet of real estate in 101 countries, comprised of 12,800
properties.         Citigroup believes its properties are adequate
and suitable for its business as presently conducted and are adequately
maintained. Citigroup continues to evaluate its current and projected space
requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises
and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance
that Citigroup will be able to dispose of any such excess premises or that it
will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions. Such disposition
costs may be material to Citigroup s operating results in a given
period. 

             Citi has developed programs to achieve long-term energy efficiency
objectives and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions with respect to its
properties. These activities could help to mitigate, but will not eliminate,
Citigroup s  risk of increased costs from potential future regulatory
requirements that would impact Citi as a consumer of energy. 

             For further information concerning leases, see Note 29 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    In addition to the matters described below, in
the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and its affiliates and subsidiaries
and current and former officers, directors and employees (for purposes of this
section, sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties)
routinely are named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions
and proceedings. Certain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek
relief in connection with alleged violations of consumer protection, securities,
banking, antifraud, antitrust, employment and other statutory and common laws.
Certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and proceedings include
claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for
injunctive relief.         In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup
and Related Parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory
examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings
(both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments,
settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Certain affiliates
and subsidiaries of Citigroup are banks, registered broker-dealers or investment
advisers and, in those capacities, are subject to regulation by various U.S.,
state and foreign securities and banking regulators. In connection with formal
and informal inquiries by these regulators, Citigroup and such affiliates and
subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents,
testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of their
regulated activities.         Because of the global scope of Citigroup s
operations, and its presence in countries around the world, Citigroup and
Related Parties are subject to litigation, and governmental and regulatory
examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings
(both formal and informal) in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory
regimes that may differ substantially, and present substantially different
risks, from those Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to in the United
States.        Citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the
manner management believes is in the best interests of the Company and contests
liability, allegations of wrongdoing and, where applicable, the amount of
damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each
pending matter. In view of the inherent unpredictability of litigation and
regulatory matters, particularly where the damages sought are substantial or
indeterminate, the investigations or proceedings are in the early stages, or the
matters involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, Citigroup
cannot state with certainty the timing or ultimate resolution of litigations and
regulatory matters or the eventual loss, fines, penalties or business impact, if
any, associated with each pending
matter.         In accordance with ASC 450 (formerly SFAS 5),
Citigroup establishes reserves for litigation and regulatory matters when those
matters present loss contingencies that both are probable and can be reasonably
estimated. Once established, reserves are adjusted from time to time, as
appropriate, in light of additional information. The actual costs of resolving
litigations and regulatory matters, however, may be substantially higher or
lower than the amounts reserved for those matters.  

Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup s management,
based on current knowledge and after taking into account available insurance
coverage and its current legal reserves, that the eventual outcome of such
matters, including the matters described below, would not be likely to have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citi.
Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of
these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse
outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material
adverse effect on Citi s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in
particular quarterly or annual periods. 

Credit-Crisis-Related Litigation and
Other Matters    Citigroup
and Related Parties have been named as defendants in numerous legal actions and
other proceedings asserting claims for damages and related relief for losses
arising from the global financial credit and subprime-mortgage crisis that began
in 2007. Such matters include, among other types of proceedings, claims asserted
by: (i) individual investors and purported classes of investors in Citi s common
and preferred stock and debt, alleging violations of the federal securities
laws; (ii) individual investors and purported classes of investors in, and
issuers of, auction rate securities alleging violations of the federal
securities and antitrust laws; (iii) shareholders alleging derivative claims
related to subprime and auction-rate securities activities; (iv) participants
and purported classes of participants in Citi s retirement plans, alleging
violations of ERISA; (v) counterparties to significant transactions adversely
affected by developments in the credit and subprime markets; (vi) individual
investors and purported classes of investors in securities and other investments
underwritten, issued or marketed by Citigroup, and other strategic investments,
that have suffered losses as a result of the credit crisis; (vii)
municipalities, related entities and individuals asserting public nuisance
claims; and (viii) individual borrowers asserting claims related to their loans.
These matters have been filed in state and federal courts across the country, as
well as in arbitrations before FINRA and other arbitration
associations.         In addition to these litigations and
arbitrations, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, certain of Citigroup s
regulators and other state and federal government agencies commenced formal and
informal investigations and inquiries, and issued subpoenas and requested
information, concerning Citigroup s subprime mortgage-related conduct and
business activities. Citigroup is involved in discussions with certain of its
regulators to resolve certain of these
matters.         Certain of these litigation and regulatory
matters assert claims for substantial or indeterminate damages. Some of these
matters already have been resolved, either through settlements or court
proceedings, including the complete dismissal of certain complaints or the
rejection of certain claims following hearings. 

263  

Subprime
Mortgage-Related Litigation and Other Matters    Beginning in November 2007, Citigroup and
Related Parties have been named as defendants in numerous legal actions and
other proceedings brought by Citigroup shareholders, investors, counterparties
and others concerning Citigroup s activities relating to subprime mortgages,
including Citigroup s exposure to collateralized debt obligations (CDOs),
mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and structured investment vehicles (SIVs),
Citigroup s underwriting activity for subprime mortgage lenders, and Citigroup s
more general involvement in subprime- and credit-related
activities.           Securities
Actions:     Several
putative class actions were filed in the Southern District of New York by
Citigroup shareholders alleging violations of Sections 10 and 20 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On August 19, 2008, these actions were
consolidated under the caption IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION, and lead
plaintiff and counsel were appointed. Plaintiffs  consolidated amended class
action complaint alleges, among other things, that Citigroup s stock price was
artificially inflated as a result of purportedly misleading disclosures
concerning Citigroup s subprime mortgage related exposures. A motion to dismiss
the consolidated class action complaint is
pending.         In addition, Citigroup and Related Parties
were named as defendants in two putative class actions filed in New York state
court but since removed to the Southern District of New York. These actions
allege violations of Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933,
arising out of various offerings of Citigroup notes during 2006, 2007 and 2008.
On December 10, 2008, these actions were consolidated under the caption IN RE
CITIGROUP INC. BOND LITIGATION. A motion to dismiss the consolidated class
action complaint is pending.           ERISA
Actions:     Numerous
class actions were filed in the Southern District of New York asserting claims
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) against Citigroup and
certain Citigroup employees alleged to have served as ERISA plan fiduciaries. On
August 31, 2009, the court granted defendants  motion to dismiss the
consolidated class action complaint, captioned IN RE CITIGROUP ERISA LITIGATION.
Plaintiffs have appealed the
dismissal.           Derivative Actions and
Related Proceedings:     Numerous derivative actions have been filed in federal and state courts
against various current and former officers and directors of Citigroup alleging
mismanagement in connection with subprime mortgage related exposures. Citigroup
is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. Certain of these actions have
been dismissed either in their entirety or in large part. In addition, a
committee of Citi s Board of Directors is reviewing certain shareholder demands
that raise subprime-related
issues.          Underwriting
Matters:     Certain
Citigroup affiliates and subsidiaries have been named as defendants for their
activities as underwriters of securities in actions brought by investors in
securities of issuers adversely affected by the credit crisis, including AIG,
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ambac and Lehman, among many others. These matters are
in various stages of litigation.  

Subprime Counterparty and
Investor Actions:    
Citigroup and Related Parties have been named as defendants in actions brought
in various state and federal courts, as well as in arbitrations, by
counterparties and investors that have suffered losses as a result of the credit
crisis, including: Ambac Credit Products, LLC, which alleges various claims
including fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with Citigroup s
purchase of credit protection from Ambac for a $1.95 billion super-senior
tranche of a CDO structured by Citigroup subsidiaries; investors and purported
classes of investors in the Falcon and ASTA/MAT funds, alleging violations of
federal securities and state laws arising out of Citigroup s sale and marketing
of shares in certain of these funds; and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority,
alleging statutory and common law claims in connection with its $7.5 billion
investment in Citigroup. These matters are in various procedural stages.

Auction Rate Securities-Related Litigation and
Other Matters    Beginning
in March 2008, Citigroup and Related Parties have been named as defendants in
numerous actions and proceedings brought by Citigroup shareholders and customers
concerning auction rate securities (ARS). In addition to those matters described
below, these have included, among others, numerous arbitrations filed by
customers of Citigroup and its subsidiaries seeking damages in connection with
investments in ARS, which are in various stages of proceedings, and a derivative
action filed against certain Citigroup officers and directors, which has been
dismissed. A committee of Citi s Board of Directors is reviewing a demand sent
to the Board following the dismissal of the derivative
action.           Securities
Actions:     Beginning
in March 2008, Citigroup and Related Parties were named as defendants in a
series of putative class action lawsuits related to ARS. These actions have been
consolidated into a single action pending in the Southern District of New York,
captioned IN RE CITIGROUP AUCTION RATE SECURITIES LITIGATION, asserting claims
for federal securities and other statutory and common law violations. On
September 11, 2009, the court granted defendants  motion to dismiss the
consolidated amended complaint. On October 15, 2009, plaintiffs filed a further
amended complaint, which defendants also have moved to dismiss.

264  

Antitrust
Actions:     Two
antitrust actions were filed in the Southern District of New York on behalf of
purported classes of ARS issuers and investors, respectively, against Citigroup,
CGMI and various other financial institutions. In these actions, plaintiffs
allege violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act arising out of defendants 
alleged conspiracy to restrain trade in the ARS market. On January 26, 2010,
both actions were dismissed. 

Lehman Structured Notes
Matters    Like many other
financial institutions, Citigroup, through certain of its affiliates and
subsidiaries, distributed structured notes issued and guaranteed by Lehman
entities to retail customers in various countries outside the United States,
principally in Europe and Asia. After the relevant Lehman entities filed for
bankruptcy protection in September 2008, certain regulators in Europe and Asia
commenced investigations into the conduct of financial institutions involved in
such distribution, including Citigroup entities. These regulatory investigations
are in various stages, and some have resulted in adverse findings against
Citigroup entities. Some purchasers of the notes have filed civil actions or
otherwise complained about the sales process. Citigroup has generally dealt with
such complaints and claims on an individual basis based on the particular
circumstances. In Belgium and in Poland, however, Citigroup has made a
settlement offer to all eligible purchasers of notes distributed by Citigroup in
those countries. A significant majority of the eligible purchasers have accepted
these offers. Also in Belgium, a criminal case is proceeding against a Citigroup
subsidiary, two current employees and one former employee. Citigroup disputes
that it or its employees have engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the
distribution of Lehman notes in Belgium or elsewhere and is defending the
charges. Criminal investigations have also commenced in Greece and
Poland. 

Interchange Fees
Litigation    Beginning in
2005, several putative class actions were filed against Citigroup and certain of
its subsidiaries, together with Visa, MasterCard and other banks and their
affiliates, in various federal district courts. These actions were consolidated
with other related cases in the Eastern District of New York and captioned IN RE
PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The
plaintiffs in the consolidated class action are merchants that accept Visa and
MasterCard branded payment cards as well as membership associations that claim
to represent certain groups of merchants. The pending complaint alleges, among
other things, that defendants (including the Citigroup defendants) have engaged
in conspiracies to set the price of interchange and merchant discount fees on
credit and debit card transactions in violation of Section 1  

of the Sherman Act and a
California statute. The complaint also alleges additional Sherman Act and
California law violations, including alleged unlawful maintenance of monopoly
power and alleged unlawful contracts in restraint of trade pertaining to various
Visa and MasterCard rules governing merchant conduct (including rules allegedly
affecting merchants  ability, at the point of sale, to surcharge payment card
transactions or steer customers to particular payment cards). In addition,
supplemental complaints filed against defendants in the class action allege that
Visa s and MasterCard s respective initial public offerings were anticompetitive
and violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and that MasterCard s initial public
offering constituted a fraudulent
conveyance.         In addition to injunctive relief, plaintiffs
seek joint and several liability for treble the amount of damages, including all
interchange fees paid to all Visa and MasterCard members with respect to Visa
and MasterCard transactions in the U.S. since at least January 1, 2004.
Defendants  motions to dismiss the pending class action complaint and the
supplemental complaints are pending. Also pending is plaintiffs  motion to
certify nationwide classes consisting of all U.S. merchants. Discovery has
closed, with the exception of expert discovery. 

Parmalat Litigation and Other
Matters    On July 29,
2004, Dr. Enrico Bondi, the Extraordinary Commissioner appointed under Italian
law to oversee the administration of various Parmalat companies, filed a
complaint in New Jersey state court against Citigroup and Related
Parties alleging that the defendants  facilitated  a number of frauds by
Parmalat insiders. The complaint asserted 10 claims, nine of which were
dismissed pretrial, arising out of four sets of transactions involving
Parmalat companies; Citibank, N.A. asserted several counterclaims. On October
20, 2008, following trial, a jury rendered a verdict in Citigroup s favor on
plaintiff s remaining claim, and in favor of Citibank on three counterclaims.
The court entered judgment for Citibank in the amount of $431 million on the
counterclaims. Plaintiff s appeal from the court s final judgment is pending. In
addition, prosecutors in Parma and Milan, Italy, are conducting a criminal
investigation of Citigroup and certain current and former Citigroup employees
(along with numerous other investment banks and certain of their current and
former employees, as well as former Parmalat officers and accountants). In the
event of an adverse judgment against the individuals in question, it is possible
that the authorities could seek administrative remedies against Citigroup.
Additionally, Dr. Bondi has purported to file a civil complaint against
Citigroup in the context of the Parma criminal proceedings, seeking
14 billion Euro in damages. 

265  

Adelphia
Litigation    Adversary
proceedings were filed in 2003 by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors
and the Equity Holders Committee on behalf of Adelphia Communications
Corporation and affiliated parties against certain Citigroup affiliates and
subsidiaries as well as other lenders and investment banks asserting violations
of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Bankruptcy Code, and common law. The
complaints sought unspecified damages and recovery of certain purportedly
fraudulent transfers. Following litigation of motions to dismiss, the Adelphia
Recovery Trust (the ART), which replaced the committees as plaintiffs in the
actions, filed a consolidated amended complaint on behalf of the Adelphia
Estate. The district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants 
motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The ART s appeal to the Second
Circuit from that partial dismissal is pending. Before the district court, the
parties are briefing summary judgment. Trial of any claims that survive is
scheduled for September 2010. 

Bruno s Litigation    Plaintiffs, purchasers of senior subordinated
notes issued in connection with a 1995 leveraged recapitalization of Bruno s
Inc., filed a complaint in Alabama state court against certain Citigroup
subsidiaries and affiliates, and other defendants, in 2004, alleging violations
of state law arising out of an underwriting of Bruno s securities. Plaintiffs
seek  hundreds of millions of dollars  in damages. In January 2010, prior to
trial, the Citigroup defendants entered into a settlement conditioned on court
approval. 

Research Analyst
Litigation    Beginning in
2002, Citigroup and Related Parties were named as defendants in a series of
individual and putative class action lawsuits relating to the issuance of
research analyst reports concerning WorldCom and other issuers. One individual
WorldCom action remains pending on appeal in the Second Circuit, following
dismissal of the complaint by the federal district court for the Southern
District of New York. The Second Circuit certified certain questions of law to
the Georgia Supreme Court, which has issued an opinion answering those
questions. The Second Circuit has not yet decided the
appeal.        In March 2004, a putative research-related customer class action alleging
various state law claims arising out of the issuance of allegedly misleading
research analyst reports concerning numerous issuers was filed against certain
Citigroup defendants in Illinois state court. Citigroup s motion to dismiss the
complaint is pending.  

Cash Balance Plan
Litigation    Beginning in
June 2005, several putative class actions were filed in the Southern District of
New York by certain participants in the Citigroup Pension Plan (Plan), alleging
violations of ERISA against the Plan and other Citigroup defendants. In December
2006, the district court denied defendants  summary judgment motion; granted
summary judgment to plaintiffs on certain claims; and ordered the Plan reformed
to comply with ERISA. In January 2008, the court entered a partial final
judgment on certain of plaintiffs  claims and stayed the judgment pending
appeal. On October 19, 2009, the Second Circuit reversed the district court s
order granting summary judgment for plaintiffs and dismissed plaintiffs 
complaint. On January 12, 2010, the Second Circuit denied
rehearing. 

Allied Irish    In 2003, Allied Irish Bank (AIB) filed a
complaint in the Southern District of New York seeking to hold Citibank and Bank
of America, former prime brokers for AIB s subsidiary, Allfirst Bank (Allfirst),
liable for losses incurred by Allfirst as a result of fraudulent and fictitious
foreign currency trades entered into by one of Allfirst s traders. The Court
granted in part and denied in part defendants  motions to dismiss, and the
parties are currently engaged in discovery. 

Settlement
Payments    Payments
required in settlement agreements described above have been made or are covered
by existing litigation reserves.  

Additional lawsuits containing
claims similar to those described above may be filed in the
future. 

266  

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY; PURCHASES
OF EQUITY SECURITIES; DIVIDENDS   

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

      None. 

Share Repurchases  

Under its long-standing
repurchase program, Citigroup may buy back common shares in the market or
otherwise from time to time. This program is used for many purposes, including
offsetting dilution from stock-based  compensation programs.         The following table summarizes Citigroup s
share repurchases during 2009:  

(1)         
             
                All open
      market repurchases were transacted under an existing authorized share
      repurchase plan. Since 2000, the Board of Directors has authorized
      the repurchase of shares in the aggregate amount of $40 billion under
      Citi s existing share repurchase plan. All shares repurchased during 2009
      relate to customer fails/errors.  

(2)  
             
                Consists of
      shares added to treasury stock related to activity on employee stock
      option program exercises, where the employee delivers existing shares to
      cover the option exercise, or under Citi s employee restricted or deferred
      stock program, where shares are withheld to satisfy tax requirements.

N/A Not
      applicable 

For so long as the U.S. government holds any Citigroup common stock or
trust preferred securities acquired pursuant to the preferred stock exchange
offers consummated in 2009, Citigroup has agreed not to acquire, repurchase

or redeem any Citigroup equity or trust preferred securities,
other than pursuant to administrating its employee benefit plans or other
customary exceptions, or with the consent of the U.S.
government. 

267  

Dividends    For a summary of the cash dividends paid on
Citi s outstanding common stock during 2008 and 2009, see Note 34 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, for so long as the U.S.
government holds any Citigroup common stock or trust preferred securities
acquired pursuant to the preferred exchange offers consummated in 2009,
Citigroup has agreed not to pay a quarterly common stock dividend exceeding
$0.01 per quarter, subject to certain customary exceptions.  Further, any
dividend on Citi s outstanding common stock would need to be made in compliance
with Citi s obligations to any remaining outstanding Citigroup preferred
stock.

CORPORATE INFORMATION  

Citigroup has a Code of
Conduct that maintains its commitment to the highest standards of conduct. The

Stockholder
Information    Citigroup
common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol  C  and on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange and the Mexico Stock Exchange. Citigroup preferred stock Series
F, T and AA are also listed on the
NYSE.        Because Citigroup s common stock is listed on the NYSE, the Chief
Executive Officer is required to make an annual certification to the NYSE
stating that he was not aware of any violation by Citigroup of the corporate
governance listing standards of the NYSE. The annual certification to that
effect was made to the NYSE on May 20,
2009.        As of January 31, 2010, Citigroup had approximately 192,630 common
stockholders of record. This figure does not represent the actual number of
beneficial owners of common stock because shares are frequently held in  street
name  by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who
may vote the shares.

Amendment to the Supplemental ERISA
Compensation Plan of Citibank, N.A. and Affiliates  

WHEREAS, the Supplemental ERISA Compensation
Plan of Citibank, N. A. and Affiliates (the  Plan ) was amended and restated
effective January 1, 1989; 

WHEREAS,
the Plan was amended effective January 1, 2000 to reflect the creation of the
Citigroup Pension Plan and to limit pensionable compensation to $500,000 for any
participant who was not a Grandfathered Participant (as defined below) in the
Citigroup Pension Plan eligible for benefits under the legacy Citibank benefit
formula, and was further amended January 1, 2002 to cease accruals for any
participant who was not such a Grandfathered Participant; 

WHEREAS,
the Plan benefits of Plan participants whose accruals ceased on or before
January 1, 2002 and who had fully earned service necessary to attain early
retirement subsidies as of December 31, 2004 are not subject to Section 409A (as
defined below), and the Plan, as amended herein, does not amend, modify or
otherwise change such benefits, and accordingly, such benefits are not subject
to Section 409A; 

WHEREAS,
the Plan provides nonqualified deferred compensation that is subject to Section
409A to certain Plan participants, namely to certain of those participants who
are Grandfathered Participants in the Citigroup Pension Plan and to certain of
those Participants who are not Grandfathered Participants who earned early
retirement subsidies through increases in service after December 31,
2004; 

WHEREAS,
for distributions commencing on or after January 1, 2005 and before January 1,
2009, the Plan has complied with the rules set forth in IRS Notice 2007-86, IRS
Notice 2007-78, Section 3.03 of IRS Notice 2006-79, and predecessor guidance
(the  linked plan relief ), to the extent that benefits commencing after January
1, 2005 were subject to Section 409A; 

WHEREAS,
the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements imposed by Section 409A
with respect to Plan benefits that are subject to Section 409A and, accordingly,
the Plan shall be interpreted consistent therewith; 

WHEREAS,
the Company intends to close the Plan to Non-Grandfathered Participants after
December 31, 2008; 

NOW,
THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended as follows (effective January 1, 2009
unless otherwise indicated): 

1 

1.     The following definitions shall be added to
paragraph 1 of the Plan: 

Affiliated Company     means any corporation which is a member of a
controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of Section 414(b) of the
Code) which includes the Company, any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) which is under common control with the Company (within the meaning
of Section 414(c) of the Code), any organization (whether or not incorporated
which is a member of an affiliated service group (as defined in Section 414(m)
of the Code) which includes the Company, and any other entity required to be
aggregated with the Company pursuant to Section 414(o) of the Code. 

Beneficiary     means the person or persons who are entitled
to receive benefits under the Citigroup Pension Plan in the event of the
Participant's death (whether or not such person or persons are expressly so
designated by the Participant). 

Benefit Distribution Date     is the 90 th  day after the
Participant s Payment Event Date. 

Change in Control     has the meaning set forth in Treas. Reg.
sec. 1.409A-3(i)(5) and is applied with respect to the Participant s
employer. 

Code     means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended from time to time. 

Committee     means the Plans Administration Committee of
Citigroup Inc., or its successor, established to administer the Plan and the
Citigroup Pension Plan. 

Company     means Citigroup Inc., a Delaware
corporation, or any successor thereto. 

Disability     means a Participant s  separation from
service  within the meaning of Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A-1(h) from the Company and
all Affiliated Companies on account of a Participant s total and permanent
disability (as defined under the Company long-term disability plan applicable to
the Participant). 

Grandfathered Participant     means a Participant who is also a
 grandfathered participant  in the Citibank final average pay pension plan
formula of the Citigroup Pension Plan, as defined in Section 1.30 of Part I of
the Citigroup Pension Plan, and had not commenced benefits under the Plan by
December 31, 2008. 

Life Annuity     means those forms of actuarially equivalent
life annuities offered under the legacy Citibank benefit formula of the
Citigroup Pension Plan using the actuarial assumptions applicable to such
formula. 

Non-Grandfathered
Participant     means a
Participant who is not a Grandfathered Participant and who has a benefit that is
subject to Section 409A (i.e., who had not fully accrued service for early
retirement subsidies as of December 31, 2004) and had not commenced benefits
under the Plan by December 31, 2008. 

2 

Participant     means an individual who is entitled to a
benefit under the terms of this Plan. For Plan benefits commencing after
December 31, 2008, the term    Participant    shall
include only those Participants who have a benefit that is subject to Section
409A. A Participant shall remain a Participant until all amounts due the
Participant under the Plan have been distributed to the Participant or the
Participant's Beneficiary, as the case may be. 

Payment Event Date     means the later of (a) a Participant's
Separation from Service or (b) the date the Participant attains or would have
attained age 55; provided, however, that a Payment Event Date shall also occur
upon a Change in Control. 

Section 409A     means Section 409A of the Code and
applicable guidance issued thereunder. 

Separation from Service     means a  separation from service  within the
meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.409A-1(h) from the Company and all Affiliated
Companies, and for purposes of this Plan, such term shall also include a
Participant s termination of employment on account of death or Disability. A
 separation from service  shall occur after six months of paid or unpaid leave,
except where the right to return to work is protected by statute (such as
through the Family and Medical Leave Act or protected military leaves), or in
the case of a disability leave. 

Specified Employee     means a Participant who, as of the date of
the Participant's Separation from Service, is a  specified employee  of the
Company for purposes of Section 409A, as determined under the specified employee
determination policy established by the Company in accordance with Section
409A. 

2.     The following sentence shall be added at the
end of the first paragraph of   Paragraph 2: 

No Non-Grandfathered Participant may first become a Participant (or again
become an active Participant through a rehire) after December 31, 2008. The Plan
shall remain open to new entrants who are Grandfathered Participants; provided,
however, that Grandfathered Participants who are rehired shall not become
Grandfathered Participants for periods after their rehire. 

3.     Paragraph 3 shall be amended to read as
follows: 

(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this paragraph 3, each
Participant (or Beneficiary, in the case of a Participant s death before benefit
commencement) shall be entitled to a distribution of his or her Plan benefits on
the Payment Event Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary,
if a Participant commences his or her benefit under the Citigroup Pension Plan
in-service by reason of attainment of age 70  , such Participant shall not be
entitled to benefit commencement under this Plan until his or her Separation
from Service, if some portion of the Plan benefit is subject to Section
409A. 

3 

(b)   Except as otherwise
provided for in this paragraph 3, each Participant's annuity starting date for
purposes of calculating the value of the Participant s Plan benefits shall be
the first of the month following the Participant's Payment Event Date, and
benefits under the Plan shall commence on the first of the month following the
Benefit Distribution Date, but in no event later than the last date permitted
under Section 409A. Except as otherwise provided for in this paragraph 3, each
Participant (or Beneficiary, if applicable) shall be required to make a form of
benefit election by the date prescribed by the Committee. In the event a
Participant (or Beneficiary, as applicable) fails to make a timely form of
benefit election, the Participant s Plan benefits shall be distributed in
accordance with the default elections set forth in subparagraphs (c) and (d)
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the calculation of any payment amount
is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the
Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary, if applicable), the payment will
be treated as timely made during the first taxable year of the Participant in
which the calculation of the amount of the payment is administratively
practicable. Furthermore, the inability of the Plan to calculate the amount or
timing of a payment due to the failure of a Participant (or a Participant's
Beneficiary) to provide reasonably available information to make such
calculation does not constitute an event beyond the control of the
Participant. 

(c) On or prior to December 31, 2008, each Non-Grandfathered Participant
shall be given the opportunity to make a one-time, irrevocable election to have
the portion of his or her Plan benefits that are subject to Section 409A payable
in the form of either (i) a single sum or (ii) a Life Annuity. Any
Non-Grandfathered Participant (or his or her Beneficiary, if applicable) who
fails to make a timely election in accordance with the preceding sentence or in
accordance with subparagraph (b) above shall receive his or her Plan benefit
subject to the election in the form of a single sum, and such Plan benefits
shall be paid in accordance with the applicable subsection under this paragraph
3. The Plan benefits of each Non-Grandfathered Participant that accrued prior to
January 1, 2005 and that were vested as of December 31, 2004 shall be
administered in accordance with the Plan provisions in effect as of such date.
The method of determining the portion of the Plan benefit that is not subject to
Section 409A is set forth in Appendix A hereto. 

(d) With respect to the entire Plan benefit of each Grandfathered
Participant and any Non-Grandfathered Participant who has made a timely election
to receive a Life Annuity in accordance with subsection (c) above, each such
Participant (or his or her Beneficiary, if applicable) shall be required to
elect a particular form of Life Annuity no later than 30 days prior to the
Benefit Distribution Date; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its
discretion, permit a Participant (or a Beneficiary, if applicable) to submit a
form of benefit election after the deadline so long as benefit payments have not
commenced and such action will not give rise to adverse tax consequences under
Section 409A. If the Committee fails to receive a Participant's timely election
in accordance with the preceding sentence or in accordance with subparagraph (b)
above, the Participant s Plan benefits shall commence on the Benefit
Distribution Date in the normal form of annuity benefit applicable to the
Participant under the Citigroup Pension Plan. 

4 

(e) Each Participant, who, as of December 31, 2008, has (i) attained age
55 and (ii) accrued a deferred vested benefit under this Plan that is subject to
Section 409A but is not in pay status shall commence benefits on April 1, 2009.
Each Participant, who, as of December 31, 2008, has (i) not attained age 55 and
(ii) has accrued a deferred vested benefit under this Plan that is subject to
Section 409A but is not in pay status, shall commence benefits as of the first
of the month following the attainment of age 55. 

(f)   In the case of any
Participant who has a Separation from Service and, at the time of such
Separation from Service, is continuing to earn benefits under the Citigroup
Pension Plan by reason of a disability, such Participant s accrued benefit under
this Plan shall be calculated as if he or she had remained disabled for the
maximum amount of time permissible under the Citigroup Pension Plan. The benefit
under this Plan shall commence at the times and in the form provided under this
Paragraph 3. This approach to the calculation of Plan benefits shall apply to
terminated vested disabled participants who have not commenced Plan benefits as
of December 31, 2008 and who make elections or are otherwise described under
subparagraph (e) above. 

(g)   In the case of a
Participant s death before his or her commencement of benefits under this Plan,
the Beneficiary shall be bound by any irrevocable election as to time or form of
benefit commencement made by the Participant. Any Life Annuity election made by
the Beneficiary shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
preceding section of this paragraph 3.  

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the distribution of
Plan benefits to any Participant who is (i) a Specified Employee and (ii)
entitled to a distribution on account of his or her  separation from service, 
as defined in Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A-1(h), shall commence on the first of the
month following the earlier of the date that is six months after the date of
such separation from service or the date of the participant s death. Upon the
expiration of such six-month period or the Participant s death, retroactive
benefit payments plus interest at the Citigroup Pension Plan's rate of interest
shall be paid to the Participant or Beneficiary, if applicable. 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Plan
may not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment or amount
scheduled to be paid under the Plan except as otherwise permitted under Section
409A. 

(j) Once Plan benefit payments commence, the form or the date of such
payments shall not be changed, modified or altered in any manner, or under any
circumstance, that would give rise to adverse tax consequences under Section
409A, including, but not limited to, a Participant s being rehired by the
Company or any Affiliated Company. 

5 

6. Paragraph 5 shall be amended to read as follows: 

The Plan shall be administered by the Committee in accordance with its
terms and purposes, and the Committee shall have the authority to delegate any
and all of its powers to any person. The Committee or its delegate shall
determine the amount and manner of payment of the benefits due to or on behalf
of each Participant from the Plan and shall cause them to be paid in cash by the
appropriate employer accordingly. The Committee shall have full discretionary
authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the
Plan, including all questions of fact and law. In addition, the decisions made
by and the actions taken by the Committee in the administration of the Plan
shall be final and conclusive on all persons, and the Committee shall not be
subject to any liability whatsoever with respect to the administration of the
Plan. 

7.     Paragraph 7 shall be amended to read as
follows: 

Citigroup Inc. shall have the right at any time to amend this Plan in any
respect, or to terminate this Plan. Upon the termination of the Plan in whole or
in part, all Plan benefits that have accrued as of the date of termination shall
be paid to the Participants, to the extent permitted in accordance with Section
409A, in a single lump sum payment as soon as practicable following the
termination of the Plan. If such benefits cannot be distributed in accordance
under Section 409A, the Plan shall continue in existence for the sole purpose of
distributing such benefits. 

8.     New Paragraph 9 shall be added to read as
follows: 

Participants and Beneficiaries are liable for all income and other taxes
due as a result of benefits payable under this Plan, including, but not limited
to, income taxes imposed by Section 409A. 

9.     New Paragraph 10 shall be added as
follows: 

For benefits commencing after December 31, 2008, the annuity optional
forms of benefit under the Plan shall be actuarially equivalent to the single
life annuity determined using the factors derived from the Applicable Interest
Rate and Applicable Mortality Table designated by the Citigroup Pension Plan
under Section 417(e) of the Code with respect to (a) the entire Plan benefit of
each Grandfathered Participant who has a benefit that is subject to Section 409A
and (b) the portion of the benefit of any Non-Grandfathered Participant who has
made a timely election to receive a Life Annuity that is subject to Section
409A. 

10.     New Paragraph 11 shall be added as
follows: 

For distributions commencing on or after January 1, 2005 and before
January 1, 2009, the Plan has complied with the rules set forth in IRS Notice
2007-86, IRS Notice 2007-78, Section 3.03 of IRS Notice 2006-79, and predecessor
guidance (the  linked plan relief ), to the extent that benefits commencing
after January 1, 2005 were subject to Section 409A. 

6 

APPENDIX
A   Determining the portion of
the Plan benefit that is not subject to Section 409A ( Section 409A
grandfathering ) 

In accordance with
Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i), the amount of compensation deferred before
January 1, 2005 is the greater of (a) the amount described in the first sentence
of Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i) or (b) the amount described in the second
sentence of Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i). Accordingly, the grandfathered
amount shall be the greater of:  

(a)  
                    
              the value of the
      Plan benefit at December 31, 2004 accumulated to the Participant's actual
      benefit commencement date assuming (i) termination of employment at
      December 31, 2004, (ii) the earliest benefit commencement date, (iii)
      reasonable actuarial assumptions as set forth in the applicable plan
      documents as of December 31, 2004, (iv) the most valuable payment form,
      and (v) an accumulation of the present value at December 31, 2004 to the
      actual benefit commencement date using the assumptions used to value the
      benefit at December 31, 2004  

or  

(b)  
                    
              the value of the
      Plan benefit at the actual benefit commencement date assuming (i)
      termination of employment at December 31, 2004, (ii) reasonable actuarial
      assumptions as set forth in the applicable plan documents as of the actual
      benefit commencement date, and (iii) the actual payment form;    provided, however   , that if better factors in (ii) result
      from additional service after December 31, 2004 then such better factor
      cannot be used (improvements due to additional age or interest factors are
      permissible).

judgment of the Company limit or adversely impact the ability of the Company to
participate in, or the terms of the Company s participation in, the Troubled
Asset Relief Program, the Capital Purchase Program, or to qualify for any other
relief under EESA, Participant shall be deemed to have waived his or her right
to such Award. In addition, if applicable, the Award will be subject to
forfeiture or repayment if the Award is based on performance metrics that are
later determined to be materially inaccurate. If applicable, Participant also
hereby grants to the U. S. Treasury (or other body of the U.S. government) and
to the Company a waiver releasing the U.S. Treasury (or other body) and the
Company from any claims that Participant may otherwise have as a result of the
issuance of any regulations, determinations or interpretations that adversely
modify the terms of the Award or any benefits plans, arrangements and agreements
to eliminate any provisions that would not be in compliance with the executive
compensation and corporate governance requirements of Section 111 of EESA and
any regulations, determinations or interpretations that may from time to time be
promulgated thereunder, or any securities purchase agreement or other agreement
entered into between the Company and the U.S. Treasury (or other body) pursuant

*The terms,
conditions and restrictions applicable to your award, including what happens in
the event of a termination or suspension of your employment, and including

CITI   LONG-TERM RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD
AGREEMENT APPENDIX  

This Appendix
constitutes part of the Equity Award Agreement (the     Agreement    ) and is applicable to the    Long-Term Restricted Stock Program    award summarized on the first page of
this Agreement. This Appendix is part of the Agreement and sets forth the terms
and conditions and other information applicable to the restricted or deferred
stock award (the  Award ) made to Participant under the Program, as described in
the Award Summary on page 1. All Awards are denominated in shares of Citigroup
common stock, par value $.01 per share (referred to herein as     shares     or     Citigroup stock    ). The     Company    , for purposes of this Agreement, shall
mean Citigroup and its subsidiaries that participate in the Program, except
where provided otherwise herein.  

1. Terms and Conditions.
   The terms,
conditions, and restrictions of the Award are set forth below. Certain of these
provisions, along with other important information, are summarized in the
   Citi Long-Term Restricted Stock Program
prospectus for awards granted on December 30, 2009   , and any applicable prospectus
supplement (together, the     Prospectus    ). The terms, conditions, and
restrictions of the Award include, but are not limited to, provisions relating
to amendment, vesting, and cancellation of Awards, restrictions on the transfer
of Awards, and additional restrictions or a potential modification or waiver of
Participant s rights to an Award, if required by the applicable provisions of
the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended, or the terms of
any relief provided thereunder that regulate Citigroup s policies and practices
with respect to corporate governance and executive compensation, as further
described below.  

By accepting an Award, Participant
acknowledges that he or she has read and understands the Prospectus and the
terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix. Participant understands that
this Award and all other incentive awards are entirely discretionary and that no
right to receive the Award, or any incentive award, exists absent a prior
written agreement to the contrary.   

Participant understands that the value
that may be realized from an Award, if any, is contingent and depends on the
future market price of Citigroup stock, among other factors, and that because
equity awards are discretionary, and intended to promote employee retention and
stock ownership and to align employees  interests with those of stockholders,
equity awards are subject to vesting conditions and will be canceled if vesting
conditions are not satisfied.   

Any monetary value assigned to an Award
in any communication regarding the Award is contingent, hypothetical, and for
illustrative purposes only and does not express or imply any promise or intent
by the Company to deliver, directly or indirectly, any certain or determinable
cash value to Participant. Receipt of an Award covered by this Agreement, or any
other incentive award, is neither an indication nor a guarantee that an
incentive award of any type or amount will be made in the future, and absent a
written agreement to the contrary, the Company is free to change its practices
and policies regarding incentive awards at any time in its sole discretion.

Any actual, anticipated, or estimated
financial benefit to Participant from an Award is not and shall not be deemed to
be a normal or an integral part of Participant s regular or expected salary or
compensation from employment for any purposes, including, but not limited to,
calculating any statutory, common law or other severance, resignation,
termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards,
pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments, and in no event
should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past
services for the Company.     

2. Vesting.    If conditions to vesting are satisfied,
the vested       shares underlying an Award (less any
shares withheld for the payment of taxes) will be distributed to Participant as
soon as is reasonably practicable after the date(s) such vested shares become
transferable in accordance with Section 4. Vesting in each case is subject to
receipt of the information necessary to make required tax payments and
confirmation by Citigroup that all conditions to vesting and distribution have
been satisfied. 

Vesting is conditioned on Participant s
continuous employment with the Company up to and including the scheduled vesting
date, unless otherwise provided below.   

2 

3. Fractional Shares.    Participant acknowledges that only whole
shares of Citigroup stock may be delivered upon the vesting of an Award, and
that while Citigroup will endeavor to compensate Participant in cash for any
fractional shares Participant would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
the terms of an Award, due to foreign exchange controls that may be in effect
from time to time in certain countries, there is no guarantee that such payments
can be made to Participants residing outside of the United States, and the
Company shall not be liable if for such reason payment is not made to a
Participant. 

4. Transfer Restriction.
   Participant s vested
shares are subject to a restriction on the sale or transfer of such shares
( transfer restriction ) that will lapse upon the following events: (1) 25% of
Participant s vested shares will be transferable on the date the Company repays
the U.S. government 25% of the aggregate financial assistance it received under
Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP  (2) an additional 25% of Participant s
vested shares (or an aggregate total of 50% of Participant s vested shares) will
be transferable on the date the Company repays the U.S. government 50% of the
aggregate financial assistance it received under TARP; (3) an additional 25% of
Participant s vested shares (or an aggregate total of 75% of Participant s
vested shares) will be transferable on the date the Company repays the U.S.
government 75% of the aggregate financial assistance it received under TARP; and
(4) the remainder of Participant s vested shares will be transferable on the
date the Company repays the U.S. government 100% of the aggregate financial
assistance it received under TARP. Participant will be notified when all or a
portion of his or her vested shares become transferrable on account of the
Company s repayment of the financial assistance it received under
TARP. 

5. Clawback.    The shares subject to the Award will be
cancelled or forfeited or subject to recovery by the Company if (i) the
Committee determines that (A) Participant received an Award based on materially
inaccurate financial statements (which includes, but is not limited to,
statements of earnings, revenues, or gains) or any other materially inaccurate
performance metric criteria, (B) Participant knowingly engaged in providing
inaccurate information (including knowingly failing to timely correct inaccurate
information) relating to financial statements or performance metrics, or (C)
Participant materially violated any risk limits established or revised by senior
management, a business head and/or risk management, or any balance sheet or
working or regulatory capital guidance provided by a business head, or (ii)
Participant s employment is terminated on account of misconduct (as defined
below). For purposes of this Agreement,  misconduct  means Participant s
engaging in any conduct that (i) is in competition with the Company s business
operations, (ii) that breaches any obligation that Participant owes to the
Company or Participant s duty of loyalty to the Company, (iii) is materially
injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise, or (iv) is otherwise
determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to constitute
misconduct. 

6.         Termination and Interruption of
Employment.    Participation in the Program, including but not limited to Participant s
right to vest in an Award, is conditioned upon Participant s continuous
employment with the Company, except as otherwise provided below.  

If Participant s
continuous employment with the Company terminates or is interrupted for any
reason not stated below, vesting of the Award will cease immediately; the Award
will be canceled and Participant shall have no further rights of any kind with
respect to the Award. If Participant s continuous employment with the Company
terminates or is interrupted for a reason stated below, Participant s rights
with respect to the Award will be affected as provided below. For purposes of
this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include working for a
subsidiary that is a member of the  controlled group  of Citigroup (as defined
below). For these purposes,     controlled group     has the meaning set forth in Treas.
Reg.   1.409A-1(h)(3). 

(a) Disability.
   The ward will
continue to vest during a Participant s approved disability leave pursuant to a
Company disability policy. If Participant s approved disability leave results in
his or her involuntary termination of employment with the Company by reason of
disability, Participant s unvested shares shall vest on Participant s
termination date. Vested shares will be distributed to Participant (less any
shares withheld for the payment of taxes) as soon as is reasonably practicable
after the date(s) such vested shares become transferable in accordance with
Section 4. 

(b) Approved
Personal Leave of Absence (Non-Statutory Leave).     

3 

(i) An Award will continue to vest
on schedule during the first six months of Participant s personal leave of
absence, provided that Participant s leave of absence was approved by management
of Participant s business unit in accordance with the leave of absence policies
applicable to Participant (an  approved personal leave of absence ). Any
unvested shares will be canceled as soon as the approved personal leave of
absence has exceeded six months.  

(ii) If the employment of
Participant terminates for any reason during the first six months of an approved
personal leave of absence, then such applicable provisions of this Section 6
will apply. 

(c) Statutory Leave of Absence.
   The Award will
continue to vest during a leave of absence that is approved by management of
Participant s business unit, is provided by applicable law and taken in
accordance with such law and applicable Company policy (a  statutory leave of
absence ). If a statutory leave of absence is followed without interruption by
an approved personal leave of absence, any unvested shares will be canceled as
of the date that the combined leaves, if continuous, have exceeded six months.
If the employment of Participant terminates for any reason during an approved
statutory leave of absence, then such applicable provisions of this Section 6
will apply. 

(d) Death.    If Participant s employment terminates by
reason of Participant s death, Participant s unvested shares will vest. Vested
shares will be distributed to Participant s estate (less any shares withheld for
the payment of taxes) as soon as is reasonably practicable after the date(s)
such vested shares become transferable in accordance with Section 4.

(e) Transfer to Non-Participating
Subsidiary.   

(i) If Participant transfers to a
subsidiary that is a member of the  controlled group  of Citigroup (as defined
below), the Award will continue to vest on schedule.  

(ii) If Participant transfers to a
subsidiary that is not a member of the  controlled group  of Citigroup (as
defined below), Participant s unvested shares will be cancelled.      

For purposes of this Agreement,
    controlled group     has the meaning set forth in Treas.
Reg.   1.409A-1(h)(3).  

(f) The Company is Acquired by Another Entity (Change in
Control).    If
Participant s employer is acquired by another entity in a transaction that is
described in Treas. Reg.      1,409A-3(i)(5)(i)
  (a     change in control    ) Participant s employment will not be
deemed to have terminated in connection with the change in control and the Award
will continue to vest on schedule. If the employment of Participant terminates
for any reason on or after the change in control, then such applicable
provisions of this Section 6 will apply.  

7. Non-Transferability.
   Prior to the Vesting
of an Award and the lapse of the transfer restriction of Section 4, neither the
Award, nor any share subject to the Award, may be sold, pledged, hypothecated,
assigned, margined or otherwise transferred, other than by will or the laws of
descent and distribution, and no Award or interest or right therein shall be
subject to the debts, contracts or engagements of Participant or his or her
successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer,
alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means
whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, by
judgment, lien, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable
proceedings (including bankruptcy or divorce), and any attempted disposition
thereof shall be null and void, of no effect, and not binding on the Company in
any way. Participant agrees that any purported transfer shall be null and void,
and shall constitute a breach of this Agreement causing damage to the Company
for which the remedy shall be a cancellation of the Award. During Participant s
lifetime, all rights with respect to the Award shall be exercisable only by
Participant, and any and all payments in respect of the Award shall be to
Participant only. 

4 

8. Stockholder Rights.
   Participant shall
have no rights as a stockholder of Citigroup over any unvested shares covered by
an Award, except that during the vesting period Participant shall receive
dividend or dividend equivalent payments in respect of shares subject to an
Award.  

9. Right of Set Off.    Participant agrees that the Company may,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, retain for itself funds or securities
otherwise payable to Participant pursuant to this Award or any award under any
equity award program administered by Citigroup to offset any amounts paid by the
Company to a third party pursuant to any award, judgment, or settlement of a
complaint, arbitration, or lawsuit of which Participant was the subject; to
satisfy any obligation or debt that Participant owes the Company or its
affiliates; or in the event any equity award is canceled pursuant to its terms.
The Company may not retain such funds or securities and set off such obligations
or liabilities, as described above, until such time as they would otherwise be
distributable to Participant in accordance with the applicable award terms.

10. Consent to Electronic Delivery.
   In lieu of receiving
documents in paper format, Participant hereby agrees, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to accept electronic delivery of any documents that Citigroup
may be required to deliver (including, but not limited to, prospectuses,
prospectus supplements, grant or award notifications and agreements, account
statements, annual and quarterly reports, and all other forms or communications)
in connection with the Award covered by this Agreement and any other prior or
future incentive award or program made or offered by Citigroup or its
predecessors or successors. Electronic delivery of a document to Participant may
be via a Company e-mail system or by reference to a location on a Company
intranet site to which Participant has access.  

11. Plan Administration.
   The Award described
in this Agreement has been granted subject to the terms of the Plan, and the
shares deliverable to Participant in connection with an Award will be from the
shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of the Plan. 

12. Adjustments.    In the event of any change in Citigroup s
capital structure on account of (i) any extraordinary dividend, stock dividend,
stock split, reverse stock split or any similar equity restructuring; or (ii)
any combination or exchange of equity securities, merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, reorganization, divestiture or other distribution (other than
ordinary cash dividends) of assets to stockholders, or any other similar event
affecting Citigroup s capital structure, to the extent necessary to prevent the
enlargement or diminution of the rights of Participants, the Committee shall
make such appropriate equitable adjustments as may be permitted by the terms of
the Plan and applicable law, to the number or kind of shares subject to an
Award. All such adjustments shall conform to the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code, to the extent applicable, and with respect to Awards intended to
qualify as  performance-based compensation  under Section 162(m) of the Code,
such adjustments or substitutions shall be made only to the extent that the
Committee determines that such adjustments or substitutions may be made without
causing the Company to be denied a tax deduction on account of Section 162(m) of
the Code. Citigroup shall give each Participant notice of an adjustment
hereunder and, upon notice, such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its
discretion, decline to adjust any Award made to a Participant, if it determines
that such adjustment would violate applicable law or result in adverse tax
consequences to the Participant or the Company, and neither the Committee nor
Citigroup shall be bound to compensate any Participant for any such adjustment
not made, nor shall they be liable to Participant for any additional personal
tax or other consequences of any adjustments that are made to an Award.

13. Taxes and Tax Residency Status.
   By accepting the
Award, Participant agrees to pay all applicable income and/or social taxes and
file all required tax returns in all jurisdictions where Participant is subject
to tax and/or an income tax filing requirement. If Participant is an employee in
one of Citigroup s expatriate programs, he or she agrees to pay all applicable
income and/or social taxes and file all tax returns in accordance with the
applicable expatriate policy. To assist Citigroup in achieving full compliance
with its obligations under the laws of all relevant taxing jurisdictions,
Participant agrees to keep complete and accurate records of his or her income
tax residency status and the number and location of workdays outside his or her
country of income tax residency from the date of an Award until the later of the
vesting of an Award or the subsequent sale of any shares received in connection
with an Award. By signing this Agreement, Participant also agrees to provide,
upon request, information about his or her tax residency status to Citigroup
during such period. Participant will be responsible for any income tax due,
including penalties and interest, arising from any misstatement by Participant
regarding such information.  

5 

14. Entire Agreement; No Right to
Employment.    The
Prospectus and the Agreement constitute the entire understanding between the
Company and Participant regarding the Award and supersede all previous written,
oral, or implied understandings between the parties hereto about the subject
matter hereof, including any written or electronic agreement, election form or
other communication to, from or between Participant and the Company. Nothing
contained herein, in the Plan, or in any Prospectus shall confer upon
Participant any rights to continued employment or employment in any particular
position, at any specific rate of compensation, or for any particular period of
time.  

15. Amendment.    The Committee may, in its sole
discretion, modify, amend, terminate or suspend the Award or the Program at any
time, except that no termination, suspension, modification or amendment of the
Award or the Program shall (i) cause the Award or the Program to become subject
to, or violate, Section 409A of the Code, or (ii) adversely affect Participant s
rights with respect to the Award, as determined by the Committee, without
Participant s written consent. 

16. Compliance with Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008.    Participant acknowledges that if Participant and any Award governed by
this Agreement are subject to Section 111 of the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended, and any regulations, determinations or
interpretations that may from time to time be promulgated thereunder ( EESA ),
then any payment of any kind provided for by this Agreement must comply with
EESA, and that this Agreement shall be interpreted or reformed to so comply. If
the making of any payment pursuant to this Agreement would violate EESA, or if
the making of such payment may in the judgment of the Company limit or adversely
impact the ability of the Company to participate in, or the terms of the
Company s participation in, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Capital
Purchase Program, or to qualify for any other relief under EESA, Participant
shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to such payment. In addition, if
applicable, the Award will be subject to forfeiture or repayment if the Award is
based on performance metrics that are later determined to be materially
inaccurate. If applicable, Participant also hereby grants to the U. S. Treasury
(or other body of the U.S. government) and to the Company a waiver releasing the
U.S. Treasury (or other body) and the Company from any claims that Participant
may otherwise have as a result of the issuance of any regulations,
determinations or interpretations that adversely modify the terms of the Award
or any benefits plans, arrangements and agreements to eliminate any provisions
that would not be in compliance with the executive compensation and corporate
governance requirements of Section 111 of EESA and any regulations,
determinations or interpretations that may from time to time be promulgated
thereunder, or any securities purchase agreement or other agreement entered into
between the Company and the U.S. Treasury (or other body) pursuant to EESA.

17. Arbitration; Conflict; Governing Law.
   Any disputes related
to the Award shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Company s
arbitration policies. In the absence of an effective arbitration policy,
Participant understands and agrees that any dispute related to an Award shall be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association, if so elected by the Company in its sole discretion. In
the event of a conflict between the Prospectus and this   Agreement, this Agreement shall control.
In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall
control. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
  (regardless of conflict of
laws principles) as to all matters, including, but not limited to, the
construction, application, validity and administration of the Program.

18. Disclosure Regarding Use of Personal
Information and Participant s Consent.  

(a) Definition and Use of  Personal Information.     In connection with the grant of this
Award, and any other award under the Program or any other equity award program,
and the implementation and administration of any such program, including,

Company for potential future participation, in any program at any time,
   it is or may     become necessary for the Company to

Use, transfer,
storage and processing of personal information, electronically or otherwise, may

compliance activities directly or indirectly related to an equity award program.
For such purposes only, personal information may be used by third parties
retained by the Company to assist with the administration and compliance
activities of its equity award programs, and may be transferred by the company
that employs (or any company that has employed) Participant from Participant s

always be undertaken only in accordance with applicable law.

Dear
Alberto: 

Global Expatriate Assignment   Letter of
Understanding    

On behalf of Global
Mobility, I am pleased to confirm the terms and conditions relating to your
expatriate assignment to the Investment Banking Division   in U.A.E   .    Your assignment
is scheduled to commence on July 1, 2008, subject to your obtaining the
appropriate work permit/visa approvals. Citigroup will assist you and your
family in obtaining the appropriate documents. 

During your
expatriate assignment, your salary and benefits will be controlled exclusively
by and administered solely under the terms and conditions of the expatriate
program. Therefore, you are not eligible for any benefits or salary provided
locally in U.A.E. However, you will be subject to certain local practices, such
as office holiday schedules, and restrictions in certain countries on
participation in Citigroup equity compensation and investment
programs. 

The following is a
general summary of the key elements of the expatriate policy and benefit plans
that apply to your assignment. Other than in relation to the provisions on
duration of assignment and notice (see below), in the event of any inconsistency
between the following summary and the applicable policy or plan, the terms and
conditions of the applicable policy or plan shall control and govern for the
period of your expatriate assignment. 

Attached is a
preliminary salary worksheet, which will provide you with an estimate of your
compensation and allowances under the expatriate program. Allowances fluctuate
based on various conditions, including exchange rates. Refer to the applicable
Expatriate Handbook for details. 

DURATION AND REASON FOR
ASSIGNMENT  

It is anticipated
that the length of your assignment to fill a specific need with the Investment
Banking Division as a Global Co-Head will not exceed three years, subject to
business needs and circumstances in each case, and to the notice provisions set
out in this letter below. If your assignment extends beyond three years, during
the fourth year, your business in its sole discretion may extend your expatriate
assignment or begin to explore other options, including but not limited to,
termination of your assignment (see notice provisions below). Citigroup may, on
termination of your assignment, at its sole discretion, offer you the
opportunity to either become a local employee, repatriate to your original
sending country, or take another expatriate assignment in another
country.

This letter is
not an employment contract or a guarantee to employ you for any definite period
of time or at any place at any time. To the extent legally permissible, your
employment at all times is on an  at-will  basis.  

SALARY   

At the start of
your assignment, your annual gross base salary will be US$225,000 and your job

charges referred to below.)

policies.  

HYPOTHETICAL TAX WITHHOLDING AND
HYPOTHETICAL HOUSING CHARGES   

Actual and Hypothetical
Taxes       Citigroup will pay all income taxes to all taxing jurisdictions on total
Citigroup compensation paid during your expatriate assignment. During this same
period, Citigroup will deduct hypothetical taxes from your expatriate salary
each month. You are also responsible for hypothetical tax on any Citigroup
equity income during your assignment (e.g., stock option exercise gains and the
value of stock awards at vesting). Hypothetical taxes, calculated on your
Citigroup compensation, are based on United States income tax. You will be
responsible for all actual taxes due on any non-Citigroup income, but you may be
entitled to claim a limited right to tax protection for such income, as more
fully explained in the applicable Expatriate Handbook.  

The benefits
described in the Expatriate Handbook and summarized elsewhere herein, for which
you may be eligible as a participant in the expatriate program, including the
tax equalization policy, will at all times be subject to the terms of the
expatriate program then in effect. These benefits are broadly designed to limit
as far as reasonably possible your out-of-pocket costs for certain living
expenses, including income taxes, to what you would have paid had you been an
employee under local terms and conditions in your compensation country. To
ensure the fair and equitable administration of these policies, you agree to
assume the following responsibilities:  

Payment of Tax Obligations to
Citigroup       You agree to pay Citigroup any outstanding hypothetical taxes within 30
days of the date of your final tax reconciliation statement for the year (the
 Due Date ). Payments not received by the Due Date will be subject to additional
interest charges and penalties.  

Filing Tax
Returns       You agree to cooperate with PwC in preparing any required income tax
returns including providing PwC with any required information in a timely manner
and ensuring that it is complete and accurate in all material respects. You will
be liable for any charges, penalties and interest assessed by the taxing
authorities as a result of any untimely or inaccurate
submissions.  

Page 4 of
7  

Notice and Right of
Offset       If you cannot meet any of these tax related obligations within the time
provided, you agree to notify Citigroup in writing as soon as reasonably
practicable, fully describing the reasons for your non-compliance. Depending on
the circumstances, Citigroup may, at its discretion, offer you an adjusted
payment schedule (but shall be under no obligation to do so). However, if any
amounts due hereunder remain unpaid for 120 days after the Due Date and a
re-payment schedule has not been agreed to by you and Citigroup in writing, you
hereby consent to the deduction of any such sums owing by you to Citigroup from
your salary, any allowances, reimbursements or any other payment or payments due
to you from Citigroup or any associated company. You hereby also agree to make
immediate payment of any such sums owed by you to Citigroup or any associated
company upon demand.  

Hypothetical Housing
Charges       Citigroup will deduct a hypothetical housing cost from your expatriate
pay each month. Hypothetical housing costs represent an independent estimate of
the average expense of housing in New York for a person at your salary level and
family size. This deduction can change when there is a change in your base
salary and also annually based upon survey data provided by an independent
consultant. You agree to this deduction from your pay and acknowledge that it
may be less than or may exceed the housing allowance described below, based on
housing costs in your assignment location relative to average housing costs in
New York.  

SPECIFIC EXPATRIATE ASSIGNMENT
ALLOWANCES   

Listed below
are the major expatriate allowances. Citigroup will pay any taxes due on these
allowances.  

Housing
Allowance       Citigroup will pay a housing and utility allowance designed to cover the
cost of housing in your assignment country. This amount is based on your family
size (which includes only those who accompany you on assignment) and is limited
to an amount determined for your country of assignment. The allowance is subject
to periodic reviews and may change based upon survey data provided by an
independent consultant. Any rental and utility costs in excess of the country
allowance for your family size is your responsibility.  

Citigroup will
pay all taxes incurred on this housing allowance.  

Moving
Allowance       At the beginning of your assignment, you will receive a one-time lump-sum
moving allowance of US$10,000 to cover some of your incidental moving
expenses.  

Goods and Services
Differential       To cover the difference in the cost of
goods and services between New York and Dubai, a Goods and Services (G S)
Differential will be paid to you, if applicable, as a tax-free monthly payment.
The amount provided can change monthly depending on inflation, foreign exchange
rates, salary and family size. It is paid only if the cost of goods and
services, as determined by our outside consultant, exceed the costs in New
York.  

Page 5 of
7  

Hardship
Allowance       Due to living conditions in Dubai, you are eligible for a hardship
allowance. The amount of the allowance is a variable percentage of your base
salary (capped at $150,000), which for your assignment location is currently 10%
per month. Hardship allowances are reviewed periodically (generally, annually)
and are therefore subject to change. Citigroup will pay any taxes due on this
allowance.  

EMPLOYMENT
STATUS   

During the term
of your assignment you will not be an employee of CGML Dubai or Citibank NA
Dubai Branch. You shall remain an employee of the Citigroup employing entity as
set out in your employment contract which will be lending your services to the
Investment Banking Division of CGML Dubai pursuant to an inter-company agreement
for the supply of employee services.  

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND COUNTRIES
DEFINED   

Employee
Benefits       Throughout your assignment, you will be eligible for the expatriate
health and insurance program, which includes medical and dental
coverage.  

Information on
your various benefits will be provided to you under separate
cover.  

Countries
Defined       Your expatriate assignment will typically impact more than one
jurisdiction. In order to facilitate the best possible management of
expatriate-related benefits, the countries to which you have a relationship
during your assignment are specified as follows:  

Your   assignment country   is U.A.E. and your
  compensation country   is the United
States.  

Your   pension country   is the United States.
You will continue to be covered under the current retirement plan for your
pension country for which you are eligible (if any). Generally, you will not be
eligible for any company or government provided benefits in your assignment
country, unless required by law. You will remain eligible for other mandatory or
government social/welfare programs in your pension country to the extent legally
possible.  

Your   home
leave country   is United States and is the country to which you and
your family may take your annual home leave.    

Page 6 of
7  

Your principal
residence is located in the United States, which is defined as your   property management
country  .  

The country to
which you are expected to return at the end of your expatriate assignment is the
United States, which is defined as your   return country  . Citigroup will make a
reasonable effort to find you a suitable position within Citigroup upon your
return to this country. However, you accept that Citigroup does not guarantee
you reinstatement to your pre-assignment position (or any other position of
employment) in this country or anywhere else in the world.  

VARIATION OR TERMINATION OF POLICY
AND/OR TERMS OF ASSIGNMENT   

Citigroup
reserves the right to modify, amend and/or discontinue any of the terms and
conditions of the policies or programs described in this letter and/or the
Expatriate Handbook, or any other aspect of the expatriate program, at any time
and from time to time. Citigroup also maintains and you acknowledge by signing
below, that the place of work is not an essential element of the employment
relationship and can be changed by the company, in its sole
discretion.  

NOTICE   

Your employment
may be terminated in accordance with the notice provisions set out in your
contract of employment.  

You should
refer to the notice section of the Expatriate Handbook for further information
relating to the terms and conditions that apply to the termination of your
employment (by Citigroup or by you) during your expatriate
assignment.  

DATA PRIVACY   

By signing this
letter, you agree that Citigroup, any Associated Company and/or third parties
may in connection with your employment and/or your expatriate assignment (during
and after termination), process personal data (including sensitive personal
data) for the purposes of managing your employment and assignment arrangements
(for example, for the provision of benefits to you), for compliance with legal
and regulatory obligations (including, but not limited to, the prevention and
detection of crime and anti-terrorism), for the purpose of Citigroup s business
or other legitimate interests or as otherwise required or permitted by law or
regulation. Because of the international nature of an expatriate assignment,
your personal data will, subject to applicable law, be transferred
internationally to other countries worldwide for the purposes of managing your
international assignment. This may mean that personal data is transferred to
countries, such as the United States, where the data servers are located. Each
country provides different standards of legal protection of personal
data .

Dear Ned:

Reference is made to
our letter agreement dated February 4, 2008 (the  Letter Agreement ). In light
of the need to modify the Letter Agreement to reflect your changed position
within Citigroup Alternative Investments ( CAI ) since the execution of the
Letter Agreement, you and we hereby agree to amend the Letter Agreement as
follows:  

The third sentence of
the second paragraph of paragraph 1 shall be amended and restated as follows:

Good Reason shall mean (i) a material reduction in your title,
responsibilities, duties, authority or positions, all as in effect on the date
hereof or as altered with your written consent; (ii) a decrease in your

(A) you are no longer Head of Global Banking and President and CEO of CAI or (B)
a change in your reporting relationship as in effect on the date hereof unless
after such change you report solely to the Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup
Inc. or as altered with your written consent or (iv) a transfer of your primary
workplace outside of Manhattan unless the Company s or CAI s principal corporate
office is moved outside Manhattan and you are asked to transfer to such
principal corporate office, in which case Good Reason shall mean moving the
Company s or CAI s principal corporate office more than 30 miles outside
Manhattan;    provided, however,    that no event or condition specified in

the Company written notice of your intention to terminate your employment for
Good Reason and the grounds for such termination within 30 days of your
discovery of such grounds, and (y) such grounds for termination (if susceptible
to correction) are not corrected by the Company within 30 days of its receipt of
such notice (or, in the event that such grounds are susceptible to correction
but cannot be corrected within such 30-day period, the Company has taken all
reasonable steps within such 30-day period to correct such grounds, and such
grounds are not corrected within the next 30-day period thereafter);
   provided, further,    that no change in title or reporting
relationship shall constitute Good Reason if (aa) such change arises in
connection with a reorganization of the Company s  

management or organizational structure so that such title no longer
exists and (bb) you are provided a title with substantially similar authority
and/or equivalent reporting relationship.   

Very truly yours,

outside Manhattan; provided, however, that no event or condition specified in
subparagraphs (i)   (iv) above shall constitute Good Reason unless (x) you give
the Company written notice of your intention to terminate your employment for
Good Reason and the grounds for such termination within 30 days of your
discovery of such grounds, and (y) such grounds for termination (if susceptible
to correction) are not corrected by the Company with 20 days of its receipt of
such notice (or, in the event that such grounds are susceptible to correction
but cannot be corrected within such 20-day period, the Company has taken all
reasonable steps within such 20-day period to correct such grounds, and such
grounds are not corrected within the next 20-day period thereafter); provided,
further, that no change in title or reporting relationship shall constitute Good
Reason if (aa) such change arises in connection with a reorganization of the
Company s management or organizational structure so that such title no longer
exists and (bb) you are provided a title with substantially similar authority
and/or equivalent reporting relationship.  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if
the Company terminates your employment without Cause, you terminate your
employment with Good Reason, or your employment with the Company is terminated
by reason of your death or total disability (as determined by the Social
Security Administration) ( Disability ), (i) if such termination is prior to the
payment or grant date for the 2008 guaranteed incentive and retention award,
your 2008 guaranteed incentive and retention award will be paid to you or your
estate in all cash on the date other similar 2008 incentive and retention awards
are paid and granted, no later than March 15, 2009 or (ii) to the extent the CAP
portion of this award (not including any premium shares), if any, is not vested
and delivered as a result of such termination, the Company will cancel such
unvested and unpaid portion of this award and will make a cash payment to you
equal to the value of such canceled shares (not including premium shares) as of
the termination date. However, if it is discovered prior to the date of payment
of the award that your employment could have been terminated for Cause,

Edward J.

your employment
shall, at the election of the Company in its sole discretion, be deemed to have
been terminated for Cause, as of the date the event or events giving rise to the
termination for Cause, and the Company shall have no further obligation to pay
to you any outstanding guaranteed incentive and retention award.  

Upon termination of your employment, all
employee perquisites, entitlements and benefits will immediately cease, except
as otherwise provided for in this agreement, or as otherwise provided under the
relevant benefit plans. In addition, you agree to accept such payments,
perquisites, entitlements and benefits in full satisfaction of any and all
claims arising out of this offer.  

2. Discretionary Incentive and Retention
Award.    For fiscal year
2009 and thereafter, you will be eligible to be considered for a discretionary
award package, generally made on an annual basis. Discretionary award packages
will be made at the discretion of management based on a variety of factors,
including Citi s performance, your business unit s performance, and your
individual contribution, and are subject to the terms below.  

Award packages are made as a cash bonus or,
for award packages that exceed a certain threshold (as determined by the
Company), as a combination of an incentive award in the form of a cash bonus and
a retention award of restricted or deferred stock in accordance with CAP.

Under current program guidelines, your 2008
guaranteed and any future discretionary award packages will be composed of a
cash bonus, Core CAP and Supplemental CAP award. The Core CAP award will
represent 25% of the pre-tax value of the award package, and the Supplemental
CAP award will represent from 5-15% of the award package. The remainder of the
award package after Core CAP and Supplemental CAP will be in the form of a cash
bonus (less applicable withholdings and deductions).  

CAP awards are governed by the terms of the
prospectus in effect at the time of the award (as may be amended from time to
time) and CAP guidelines that may be modified at management s discretion. CAP
awards are subject to vesting conditions, including but not limited to continued
employment, and will be cancelled if the conditions of vesting are not met.
Absent a written agreement to the contrary, and except for your 2008 guaranteed
award, all award packages are discretionary and you do not have a right to
receive such an award. In order to be eligible to receive any discretionary
award package, you must be actively employed by Citi on the date the award is
made.  

Sign-On Award.    You will receive a sign-on award on your start
date of 36,166 restricted or deferred shares of Citigroup Inc. common stock
pursuant to the Citigroup Stock Award Program ( CSAP ). The shares of restricted
or deferred stock will vest and be distributed to you at a rate of 25% per year
over four years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided
that you remain continuously employed by Citi  

Edward J.
Kelly February 4, 2008 Page 4 of 9       

through each vesting
date and meet all other vesting conditions. More detailed information on the
terms and conditions of this grant will be outlined in the prospectus and
notification materials, which will be forwarded to you following the award date.
In the event that your employment with the Company is terminated at any time by
you with Good Reason, by involuntary termination not for Cause, or due to your
death or Disability, then the sign-on award shall fully vest and become
non-forfeitable as of the date of termination and shall be delivered to you in
freely tradeable form, or, at the Company s discretion, the Company shall pay
you the cash equivalent of any forfeited shares measured as of the date of
termination.  

Stock Ownership Commitment.    Citi is a leader among companies that
maintain a stock ownership commitment. In 2005, Citi introduced an expanded
version of the stock ownership commitment, with a 25% holding requirement that
applies prospectively. After the expansion of the stock ownership commitment
became effective in 2006, approximately 3,000 employees around the world are
subject to Citi s stock ownership commitment. We       expect that this
stock ownership commitment will apply to you.  

Compensation and Benefits.    You will be eligible to participate in the
Company s comprehensive benefit programs. All compensation and benefits are
deliverable in accordance with the Company s policies, plans and programs in
effect at the time of delivery. Further details regarding these policies,
benefit plans and programs will be provided when you begin your employment.
Please note that all the Company s compensation, benefits and other policies,
plans and programs are subject to change at management s discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to the Company s moving the contents
of your current office to your office with the Company in Manhattan, in the
event that during your employment you relocate your primary residence to the New
York City area, you will be eligible for relocation benefits under the Company s
relocation policy then in effect without regard to any time restrictions that
would otherwise apply.  

Indemnification.    You shall be indemnified to the maximum
extent provided by the corporate documents of the Company then in effect or
pursuant to applicable law and subject to your execution of applicable
undertakings, as provided by such corporate documents or applicable law,
including but not limited to recoupment if you do not meet the relevant standard
of conduct. You agree that should you request indemnification and/or the
advancement of expenses, you will repay all of such expenses if the Board of
Directors of the Company that advanced the expenses determines that the actions
for which such indemnification and/or advancement was sought did not meet the
relevant standard of conduct.  

Taxes.    All compensation, payments, incentive and
retention awards, perquisites, and benefits set forth in this letter are subject
to applicable federal, state and local taxes, and the Company will withhold such
taxes as it determines are required by applicable law or regulation. You will
remain obligated to pay all required taxes on all compensation, payments,
incentive and retention awards, perquisites, and benefits  

Edward J.
Kelly February 4, 2008 Page 5 of 9      

regardless of whether
these amounts have been withheld or are required to be withheld by the Company.

IRC Section 409A.    This letter will be administered in accordance
with section 409A       of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  Code ), and the Treasury pronouncements relating thereto. You
further agree that this Agreement may be amended by the Company to the extent
necessary to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and any rules, regulations and any Treasury pronouncements relating
thereto in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided herein to the
extent possible without additional monetary costs to the Company.  

Prior Restrictive
Covenants.    You will abide
by any pre-existing terms and conditions that are contained in any contractual
restrictive covenants you may have entered into with any prior employer, client
or other person or entity, including (without limitation) any covenants relating
to the hiring or solicitation of employees, solicitation of customers, your
employment by a competitor, or maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary
information. You represent that your employment with the Company will not be in
violation of any pre-existing restrictive covenant, and you understand that your
employment with the Company is contingent upon same. If you are subject to any
such restrictive covenants, you have already disclosed them to me and you have
provided copies of them to me.  

Non-Solicitation.    In consideration of your employment, you
agree that while you are employed, and for one year following the termination of
your employment, you will not directly or indirectly solicit, induce, or
otherwise encourage any person to leave the employment of or terminate any
customer relationship with Citi.  

Confidentiality.    You also agree that during your employment,
you may have access to or acquire confidential, client, employee, competitive
and/or other business information that is unique and cannot be lawfully
duplicated or easily acquired. You understand and agree that you will have a
continuing obligation to protect the confidentiality of such information and not
to use, publish or otherwise disclose such information either during or after
your employment with the Company.  

Pre-Employment Screening.    Your employment is contingent upon successful
completion of any and all procedures and verifications to meet employment
eligibility, including completion of a drug screening; completion of reference
checks and a background criminal report; and your providing appropriate work
authorization and completing an  I-9  form.  

Employment at Will.    This letter should not be construed as a
promise or guarantee of employment for any defined period of time. Your
employment relationship with the Company is  at will,  which affords either
party the right to terminate the relationship at any time for any reason or for
no reason at all not otherwise prohibited by law.

Severability.    In the event that any provision of this
letter shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part

release, the remaining provisions of this letter shall be unaffected thereby and
shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.

This letter and the
enclosed Principles of Employment describe the Company s offer of employment.

Office Memo

TO:  

All New Hires and Transfers  

FROM:  

Human Resources  

SUBJECT:  

PRINCIPLES OF
  EMPLOYMENT   

As you consider our
offer of employment or continued employment with Citigroup Inc., its
subsidiaries, and its and their affiliates (collectively  Citi ), there are
certain matters that we want to clarify. First, you must observe the policies
that we publish from time to time for employees. These include a requirement
that you maintain the highest standards of conduct and act within the highest
ethical principles. You must not do anything that may be a conflict of interest
with your responsibilities as an employee. These expectations are included in
your business sector s Employee Handbook, the Citi Code of Conduct, and any
other policies that apply to your business sector or to Citi employees
generally. These documents are available for your review prior to your
acceptance or transfer of employment if you choose to review them. You will be
asked to acknowledge receiving a copy of the Citi Code of Conduct (if you are a
new hire) and the Employee Handbook for your business sector on or before your
start date or transfer date. Remember it is your responsibility to read and
understand these policies and expectations. If you have any questions, now or in
the future, please ask your Human Resources Generalist. 

Second, you must
never use (except when necessary in your employment with us), nor disclose to
any unauthorized person within Citi or anyone not affiliated with Citi, any
confidential or unpublished information you obtain as a result of your
employment with us. This applies both while you are employed with us and after
that employment ends. If you leave our employ, you may not retain or take with
you any writing or other record that relates to the above.  

Third, your
employment with us requires your full attention. You waive any rights to and
further agree to assign, and hereby do assign, any work of authorship,
invention, discovery, development or improvement made or conceived by you,
either alone or jointly with others, during the time you are employed by us
which pertains to our business; arises out of your employment; is aided by the
use of time, materials, property or facilities of Citi; or is at Citi s request
and expense. In addition, in the event that you currently own rights in any
inventions or technologies (such as financial models, trading strategies or
software programs), you are required to notify your manager of the existence and
nature of such things prior to your employment with us. Unless you obtain a
signed written agreement from an authorized representative of Citi providing
otherwise prior to your employment with us, you agree to assign, and hereby do
assign, to us any interest that you have in such inventions or technologies.

Edward
J. Kelly February 4, 2008 Page 8 of
9     

Additionally you
agree to assist Citi in connection with any effort to perfect such assignment;
any controversy or legal proceeding relating to such invention, improvement,
discovery or work of authorship; and in obtaining domestic and foreign
patient(s), copyright or other protection covering the same. 

Fourth, you agree to
follow our dispute resolution/arbitration procedure for resolving all disputes*
arising out of or relating to your employment with and separation from Citi.
This applies while you are employed by us as well as after your employment ends.
While we hope that disputes with our employees will never arise, we want them
resolved promptly if they do arise. These procedures do not preclude us from
taking disciplinary actions (including terminations) at any time, but if you
dispute those actions, we both agree that the disagreement will be resolved
through these procedures. Our procedures are divided into two parts. First, an
internal dispute resolution procedure which allows you to seek review of any
action taken regarding your employment or termination of your employment which
you think is unfair. Second, in the unusual situation when this procedure does
not fully resolve a dispute, and such dispute is based upon a legally protected
right (i.e., statutory, contractual, or common law), we both agree to submit the
dispute, within the time provided by applicable statute(s) of limitations, to
binding arbitration as follows:  

B  efore the arbitration facilities of the
  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ( FINRA ) if: (1) you are an
  employee of the Global Wealth Management or Markets   Banking sectors of
  Citi; or, (2) you are an employee of both Smith Barney, a division of
  Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ( Smith Barney ) (the  Secondary Employer ) and
  another Citi affiliate (the  Primary Employer ) (which together make you a
   Dual Employee ) and your dispute involves Smith Barney or activities related
  to your securities license(s). In such Dual Employee instances, any other
  related disputes you may have against your Primary Employer must be heard
  before the FINRA as well.    
         
        Before the American Arbitration
  Association ( AAA ) where you do not meet the criteria above for FINRA
  arbitration, where the FINRA declines the use of its facilities, or where you
  are a Dual Employee and your dispute does not involve Smith Barney or
  activities related to your securities license(s).   
     
      Arbitrations shall be
conducted in accordance with the respective arbitration rules of the FINRA or
AAA, as applicable, then in effect and as supplemented by the applicable
Arbitration Policy then in effect for your business sector ( Arbitration
Policy ). Dual Employee disputes shall be governed by the Arbitration Policy of
the Primary Employer, except that notwithstanding the forum designated in such
Arbitration Policy, any disputes with Smith Barney or that relate to your
securities license(s) must be heard before the FINRA. A detailed description of
the applicable Arbitration Policy is available for review prior to your
acceptance or transfer of employment if you choose to review it, and is included
in the Employee Handbook for your business sector. Again, it is your
responsibility to read and understand the dispute resolution/arbitration
procedure. If you have any questions, now or in the future, please ask your
Human Resources Generalist. 

Fifth, nothing herein
constitutes a contract of employment for a definite period of time. The
employment relationship is  at-will  which affords either party the right to
terminate the  

Edward
J. Kelly February 4, 2008 Page 9 of
9     

relationship at any
time for no reason or any reason not otherwise prohibited by applicable law.
Citi retains the right to decrease an employee s compensation and/or benefits,
transfer or demote an employee, or otherwise change the terms and conditions of
any employee s employment with Citi at any time with or without notice at its
sole discretion.  

We believe these
matters are important to you as an employee and to us as an employer. Your
acceptance of our offer of employment with Citi or to transfer within Citi
constitutes your acceptance of the aforementioned provisions. 

Understood and
agreed.   

* These include, but
are not limited to, all claims, demands or actions alleging unlawful employment
discrimination or other conduct under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Worker Adjustment And
Retraining Notification Act of 1989, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and all
amendments to the aforementioned, and any other federal, state or local statute
or regulation or common law regarding employment, discrimination in employment,
the terms and conditions of employment, employment compensation, breach of
contract, defamation, the termination of employment, retaliation or
whistleblower claims, or any claims arising under any Citigroup Inc. Separation
Pay Plan.

Exhibit 31.01  

CERTIFICATION   

I, Vikram S. Pandit,
certify that:  

1.        

I have reviewed
      this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Citigroup Inc.;

2.        

Based on my
      knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material
      fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
      made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made,
      not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.        

Based on my
      knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
      included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
      financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
      registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.        

The registrant s
      other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and
      maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
      Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial
      reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for
      the registrant and have:  

a)        

Designed such
      disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and
      procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
      information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
      subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
      particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b)        

Designed such
      internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control
      over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
      the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

c)        

Evaluated the
      effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and
      presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the
      disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by
      this report based on such evaluation; and

d)        

Disclosed in this
      report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial
      reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter
      (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report)
      that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
      affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and

5.        

The registrant s
      other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
      evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
      registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a)        

All significant
      deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
      internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to

Exhibit 99.01  

Residual Value
Obligation  

This is the last
Quarterly Certificate related to the Residual Value Obligation Agreement that
will be filed     as an Exhibit
to Citigroup s 1934 Act filings. This Quarterly Certificate will be available in
the future at www.citimortgagembs.com. Terms used herein shall have the same
meaning as set forth in the     Residual Value
Obligation Agreement unless specifically provided otherwise. 

Associates First
Capital Corporation ( AFCC ) has determined there is no realistic expectation
that any     payment will ever be made to the
holders of the Residual Value Obligations ( RVO ). Cash available     for distribution to holders of RVOs comes
from the Residual Cash Flow of the Designated Securitization     Transactions. Pursuant to the terms of
the RVO, 100% of the Residual Cash Flow is allocated first to pay     in full the amount due Associates First
Capital Corporation. After AFCC has been paid in full, a portion     of the Residual Cash Flow is then
allocated for distribution to RVO holders. 

The remaining
source of cash from the Designated Securitization Transactions is limited to
collections on     receivables
included in the Designated Securitization Transactions. The remaining principal
balance on     such receivables total approximately
$39,000,000. Almost all of these receivables have been written off     to zero for accounting purposes and the
expectation of further payment on such receivables is     nominal. 

As of December 31,
2009, AFCC was owed $1,171,931,167 under the terms of the Residual
Value     Obligation Agreement. 

The remaining
principal balance due on the receivables included in the Designated
Securitization     Transactions is
approximately 3.5% of the amount due to AFCC.     Thus, AFCC believes that there is
no     realistic expectation that the full
amount due to AFCC will be paid nor is there a realistic expectation     that any payment will be made to RVO
holders. 

Associates First
Capital Corporation will update this Certificate in the future if the situation
changes in a     meaningful
way.
