CAUTIONARY
    STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
    FOR THE PURPOSE OF  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE 
    PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  

This  Annual Report on
     Form 10-K 
     of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements
    relating to Chevron s operations that are based on
    management s current expectations, estimates and
    projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
    energy-related industries. Words such as
     anticipates,   expects, 
     intends,   plans,   targets, 
     projects,   believes,   seeks, 
     schedules,   estimates, 
     budgets  and similar expressions are intended to
    identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
    not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
    risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
    the company s control and are difficult to predict.
    Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
    from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
    statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these
    forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
    this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no
    obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise.

    refining, marketing and chemical margins; actions of competitors
    or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude
    oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or
    product substitutes; technological developments; the results of
    operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the
    inability or failure of the company s joint-venture
    partners to fund their share of operations and development
    activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net
    production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas
    development projects; potential delays in the development,
    construction or
     start-up  of
    planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of
    the company s net production or manufacturing facilities or

    political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude oil
    production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability for
    remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
    environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment
    or product changes under existing or future environmental
    statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability
    resulting from other pending or future litigation; the
    company s future acquisition or disposition of assets and
    gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments;
    government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations,
    industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions
    on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements
    compared with the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed
    accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles
    promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set forth
    under the heading  Risk Factors  on pages 32 through
    34 in this report. In addition, such statements could be
    affected by general domestic and international economic and
    political conditions. Unpredictable or unknown factors not
    discussed in this report could also have material adverse
    effects on
     forward-looking 
    statements.

Summary
    Description of Chevron  

Chevron
    Corporation, * 

    a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
    and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
    management and technology support to U.S. and international
    subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
    operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
    generation and energy services. Upstream operations consist
    primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil
    and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and
    regasification associated with liquefied natural gas;
    transporting crude oil by major international oil export
    pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas;
    and a
     gas-to-liquids 
    project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of
    crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil
    and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined
    products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and
    rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity
    petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and
    lubricant additives.

A list of the company s major subsidiaries is presented on
     pages E-4 
    and  E-5.  As
    of December 31, 2010, Chevron had approximately
    62,000 employees (including about 3,900 service station
    employees). Approximately 30,000 employees (including about
    3,600 service station employees), or 48 percent, were
    employed in U.S. operations.

Overview
    of Petroleum Industry  

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
    by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
    control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly
    in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
    significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
    companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
    their operations and formulate their products and, in some
    cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil,
    natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
    determined by supply and demand for these commodities. However,
    some governments impose price controls on refined products such
    as gasoline or diesel fuel. The members of the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the
    world s swing producers of crude oil and their production
    levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
    Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
    largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
    economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
    other energy sources also play a significant part. Seasonality
    is not a primary driver of changes in the company s
    quarterly earnings during the year.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
    petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
    chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron
    competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum
    companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
    companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
    leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor
    required to develop and operate those properties. In its
    downstream business, Chevron also competes with fully
    integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent
    refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and
    national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of
    various goods or services in many national and international
    markets.

Operating
    Environment  

Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-10 of this
     Form 10-K 
    in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the
    company s current business environment and outlook.

*   Incorporated

    in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the
    company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and
    ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco
    Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in
    this report, the term  Chevron  and such terms as
     the company,   the corporation, 
     our,   we  and  us  may refer to
    Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated
    subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
    otherwise it does not include  affiliates  of
    Chevron   i.e., those companies accounted for by the
    equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or
    investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms
    are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
    description of any of the separate companies, each of which
    manages its own affairs.

Chevron
    Strategic Direction  

Chevron s primary objective is to create shareholder value
    and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
    will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream,
    the company s strategies are to grow profitably in core
    areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
    company s equity natural gas resource base while growing a
    high-impact global gas business. In the downstream, the
    strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the
    value chain. The company also continues to utilize technology
    across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to
    invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency
    solutions.

(b)    

Description
    of Business and Properties  

The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its
    equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with
    operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia
    and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating
    revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending
    December 31, 2010, and assets as of the end of 2010 and
    2009   for the United States and the company s
    international geographic areas   are in Note 11
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on
     page FS-41. 
    Similar comparative data for the company s investments in
    and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
    equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-43 through
    FS-45.

Capital
    and Exploratory Expenditures  

Total expenditures for 2010 were $21.8 billion, including
    $1.4 billion for the company s share of
    equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2009 and 2008, expenditures
    were $22.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively,
    including the company s share of affiliates 
    expenditures of $1.6 billion in 2009 and $2.3 billion
    in 2008.

Of the $21.8 billion in expenditures for 2010,
    87 percent, or $18.9 billion, was related to upstream
    activities. Approximately 80 percent was expended for
    upstream operations in 2009 and 2008. International upstream
    accounted for about 82 percent of the worldwide upstream
    investment in 2010, more than 80 percent in 2009 and about
    70 percent in 2008, reflecting the company s
    continuing focus on opportunities available outside the United
    States.

In 2011, the company estimates capital and exploratory
    expenditures will be $26.0 billion, including
    $2.0 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately
    85 percent of the total, or $22.6 billion, is budgeted
    for exploration and production activities, with
    $17.2 billion of that amount for projects outside the
    United States. Acquisition costs associated with the announced
    purchase of Atlas Energy, Inc., are not included.

Refer also to a discussion of the company s capital and
    exploratory expenditures on
     page FS-13. 

Upstream  

The table on the following page summarizes the net production of
    liquids and natural gas for 2010 and 2009 by the company and its
    affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production, including
    volumes from synthetic oil in 2010 and oil sands in 2009, was
    2.763 million barrels per day, up about 2 percent from
    2009. The increase was mainly associated with the
     start-up  and
     ramp-up  of
    several major capital projects   the expansion at
    Tengiz in Kazakhstan, the Tahiti Field in the U.S. Gulf of
    Mexico, Frade in Brazil, Agbami in Nigeria, and
     Tombua-Landana 
    and Mafumeira Norte in Angola. Normal field declines and the
    impact of higher prices on cost-recovery volumes and other
    contractual provisions decreased net production from last
    year s comparative period. Refer to the  Results of
    Operations  section beginning on
     page FS-7 
    for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
    2008   2010 changes in production for crude oil and
    natural gas liquids, and natural gas.

The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent
    production in 2011 will be approximately 2.790 million
    barrels per day based on the average West Texas Intermediate
    crude oil price of $79 per barrel in 2010. This estimate is
    subject to many factors and uncertainties, including additional
    quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on production
    volumes calculated under production-sharing and variable-royalty
    provisions of certain agreements, changes in fiscal terms or
    restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in
    project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in
    various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production,
    civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of
    maintenance turnarounds,
     greater-than-expected 
    declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions
    to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also
    affected by the size and number of economic investment
    opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag
    between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
    Refer to the  Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production
    Activities in Key Areas,  beginning on page 9, for a
    discussion of the company s major crude oil and natural gas
    development projects.

Includes wells producing or capable of producing and injection
    wells temporarily functioning as producing wells. Wells that
    produce both crude oil and natural gas are classified as oil
    wells.

2 

Gross wells include the total number of wells in which the
    company has an interest. Net wells include wholly owned wells
    and the sum of the company s fractional interests in gross
    wells.

3 

Canadian synthetic oil is not produced through wells and
    therefore is not represented in the table above.

Reserves  

Refer to Table V beginning on
     page FS-71 
    for a tabulation of the company s proved net crude oil and
    natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of
    2008 and each year-end from 2008 through 2010. A discussion of
    reserves governance and major changes to proved reserves by
    geographic area for the three-year period ending
    December 31, 2010 is summarized in the discussion for Table
    V. Discussion is also provided beginning on
     page FS-71 
    regarding the nature of, status of and planned future activities
    associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves.
    The company recognizes reserves for projects with various
    development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The
    external factors that impact the duration of a project include
    scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating
    conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual
    limitations. During 2010, the company provided crude oil and
    natural gas reserves estimates for 2009 to the Department of
    Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA) that agree with
    the 2009 reserve volumes in Table V. This reporting fulfilled
    the requirement that such estimates be consistent with, and not
    differ more than 5 percent from, the information furnished
    to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the
    company s 2009 Annual Report on
     Form 10-K. 
    During 2011, the company will file estimates of crude oil and
    natural gas reserves with the Department of Energy, EIA,
    consistent with the 2010 reserve data reported in Table V.

Delivery
    Commitments  

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
    operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most
    contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
    on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
    sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
    quantities, as discussed below.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to
    deliver to third parties 253 billion cubic feet of natural
    gas through 2013. The company believes it can satisfy these
    contracts through a combination of equity production from the
    company s proved developed U.S. reserves and third
    party purchases. These contracts include a variety of pricing
    terms, including both index and fixed-price contracts.

Outside the United States, the company is contractually
    committed to deliver a total of 953 billion cubic feet of
    natural gas from 2011 through 2013 from Australia, Colombia,
    Denmark and the Philippines to third parties. The sales
    contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally
    referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural
    gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The
    company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities
    available from production of the company s proved developed
    reserves in these countries.

Exploration
    Activities  

The following table summarizes the company s net interests
    in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the
    last three years and the number of exploratory wells drilling at
    December 31, 2010.  Exploratory wells  are wells
    drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unproved
    areas and include delineation wells, which are wells drilled to
    find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be
    productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or
    to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area.

Review of
    Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key
    Areas  

Chevron s 2010 key upstream activities, some of which are
    also discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on
     page FS-2, 
    are presented below. The comments include references to
     total production  and  net production, 
    which are defined under  Production  in
    Exhibit 99.1 on
     page E-25. 

The discussion that follows references the status of proved
    reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
    on production and for projects recently placed on production.
    Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries that have not
    advanced to a project stage or for mature areas of production
    that do not have individual projects requiring significant
    levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated
    for project costs represent total project costs, not the
    company s share of costs for projects that are less than
    wholly owned.

Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the
    world s major hydrocarbon basins. The company s
    upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new
    legacy positions and commercialize the company s equity
    natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas
    business. The map at left indicates Chevron s primary areas
    of exploration and production.

a)    

United
    States  

Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in
    California, the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas,
    New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. Average net
    oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2010 was
    708,000 barrels per day.

In California, the company has significant production in the
    San Joaquin Valley. In 2010, average net oil-equivalent
    production was 199,000 barrels per day, composed of
    178,000 barrels of crude oil, 96 million cubic feet of
    natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.
    Approximately 84 percent of the crude oil production is
    considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22
    degrees).

Average net oil-equivalent production during 2010 for the company s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 260,000 barrels per day. The daily  oil-equivalent  production was composed of 169,000 barrels of crude oil, 445 million cubic feet of natural gas and 17,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.   In April 2010, an accident occurred at the BP-operated Macondo prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a loss of life, the sinking of the rig and a significant oil spill. Chevron was not a participant in the well. Subsequent to the event, the U.S. Department of the Interior placed a moratorium on the drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers (BOPs) or surface BOPs on a floating facility in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific 

regions. During the moratorium, Chevron participated in a number
    of industry efforts to identify opportunities to improve
    industry standards in prevention, intervention and spill
    response. In July 2010, Chevron and several other major energy
    companies announced plans to build and deploy a rapid response
    system that will be available to capture and contain oil in the
    unlikely event of a potential future well blowout in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In October 2010, the Secretary of the
    Interior lifted the moratorium on deepwater drilling activity,
    provided that operators certify compliance with new rules and
    requirements. The drilling moratorium and the ensuing slowdown
    in issuing drilling permits have resulted in delays in shallow
    water drilling activity, delayed drilling of exploratory
    deepwater wells and impacted development drilling on both
    operated and nonoperated projects in the Gulf of Mexico. In
    addition, the company s net oil-equivalent production in
    the Gulf of Mexico was reduced by about 10,000 barrels per
    day for the full year.

Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development
    activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2010. First
    oil at the Perdido Regional Development was achieved in first
    quarter 2010. The development includes a 37.5 percent
    nonoperated working interest in a producing host facility in
    Alaminos Canyon designed to service multiple nonoperated fields,
    including Chevron s 33.3 percent-owned Great White,
    60 percent-owned Silvertip and 57.5 percent-owned
    Tobago. The development has an expected production life of
    approximately 25 years.

The final investment decision was made for the Tahiti 2
    waterflood project in third quarter 2010. Tahiti 2 is the second
    development phase for the 58 percent-owned and operated
    Tahiti Field and is designed to increase recovery and maintain

10

production near the facility capacity of 125,000 barrels of
    oil per day. The project includes three water injection wells,
    two additional production wells and the facilities required to
    deliver water to the injection wells. Drilling began on the
    first water injection well in September 2010. The field has an
    estimated production life of 30 years. As of the end of
    2010, proved reserves had not been recognized for this second
    development phase of the Tahiti Field.

During 2010, work continued at the 60 percent-owned and
    operated Big Foot discovery. The project completed front-end
    engineering and design (FEED) in June 2010 and a final
    investment decision was made in December 2010. Total maximum
    production is expected to reach 79,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day. First production is expected in 2014,
    and at the end of 2010 proved reserves had not been recognized.
    The field has an estimated production life of 20 years.

The topsides modifications to the host facility of the
    Caesar/Tonga Project were completed in 2010. The company has a
    20.3 percent nonoperated working interest in the Caesar and
    Tonga partnerships unitized area. Development plans include a
    total of four wells and a subsea tieback to a nearby third-party
    production facility. Work on the subsea system, commissioning of
    the topsides and the initial well completion program carried
    over into 2011. A recent mechanical issue involving the
    production riser system has delayed first production. Proved
    reserves have been recognized for the project.

The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of
    each other and are being jointly developed. Chevron has a
    50 percent working interest in Jack and a 51 percent
    working interest in St. Malo, following the acquisition of an
    additional 9.8 percent equity interest in St. Malo in March
    2010. Both fields are company operated. The FEED activities
    initiated in 2009 continued into 2010, and a final investment
    decision was achieved in October 2010. The facility is planned
    to have an initial design capacity of 177,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day. Total project costs for the initial
    phase of development are estimated at $7.5 billion and
     start-up  is
    expected in 2014. The project has an estimated production life
    of 30 years. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.

Assessment of development concepts continued in 2010 for the
    appraised resource potential on the Mad Dog II Development
    Project, in which the company has a 15.6 percent
    nonoperated working interest. These areas are outside the
    drilling radius of the existing floating production facility. A
    decision on the development concept, followed by the project
    moving into the FEED stage, is expected to occur in the
    second-half 2011. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.

Studies to screen and evaluate future development alternatives
    in the Tubular Bells unitized area, in which the company has a
    30 percent nonoperated working interest, continued into
    2010, and a subsea tieback to a planned third-party host
    facility was selected as the development concept. FEED commenced
    in fourth quarter 2010 with a final investment decision expected
    in second quarter 2011. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had
    not been recognized.

Deepwater exploration activities in 2010 included participation
    in five exploratory wells   two wildcat, two appraisal
    and one delineation. Drilling operations on two exploratory
    wells were interrupted and stopped in second quarter 2010 as a
    result of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of
    Mexico, including drilling of the first appraisal well at the
    55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin discovery. The first
    appraisal well at Knotty Head was completed in March 2010 and
    interpretation of well results continued into 2011. Chevron has
    a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Knotty
    Head discovery. At the end of 2010, the company had not
    recognized proved reserves for any of these exploration projects.

During 2010, the company added 15 new leases to its deepwater
    portfolio as a result of bid awards stemming from a Gulf of
    Mexico lease sale early in the year.

Besides the activities connected with the development and
    exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has
    contracted capacity of 1 billion cubic feet per day at the
    third-party Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    regasification terminal in Louisiana to enable the import of
    natural gas for the North America market. Chevron has also
    contracted 1.6 billion cubic feet per day of capacity in a
    third-party pipeline system connecting the Sabine Pass LNG
    terminal to the natural gas pipeline grid. The pipeline provides
    access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10 major
    interstate pipeline systems, including an interconnect with
    Chevron s Sabine Pipeline, which connects to the Henry Hub.
    The Henry Hub interconnects to nine interstate and four
    intrastate pipelines and is the pricing point for natural gas
    futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Outside California and the Gulf of Mexico, the company manages
    operations across the mid-continental United States and Alaska.
    During 2010, the company s U.S. production outside
    California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged 249,000 net
    oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 91,000 barrels
    of crude oil, 773 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    29,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.

The company continues to pursue its interest in tight carbonate
    oil resources in West Texas in the Wolfcamp and associated
    formations where advances in drilling and completion
    technologies have opened up widespread targets such as the
    100 percent-owned and operated Lupin Project, where first
    oil was realized in mid-2010. Additional production growth is
    expected from both operated and nonoperated interests in these
    formations in future years through continued use of these
    advances in drilling and completion technologies. The company
    also continued the appraisal of the Haynesville shale gas play
    in East Texas.

In the Piceance Basin in northwestern Colorado, the company
    continued development of its 100 percent-owned and operated
    natural gas field. Development drilling and completion
    activities continued in 2010, with 115 completed wells available
    to supply natural gas to the central processing facility. The
    2010 work plan focused on optimization of the existing wells and
    facilities, completion of previously drilled wells, and
    designing a pilot to test liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as an
    alternative fracture fluid beginning in fourth quarter 2011.
    Future work is expected to be completed in multiple stages. The
    full development plan includes drilling more than
    2,000 wells from multi-well pads over the next 30 to
    40 years. Proved reserves for subsequent stages of the
    project had not been recognized at year-end 2010.

In February 2011, Chevron acquired Atlas Energy, Inc. The
    acquisition provides an attractive natural gas resource position
    in the Appalachian basin, primarily located in southwestern
    Pennsylvania, and consists of approximately 850,000 total acres
    of Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale. The acquisition provides a
    49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC, an
    affiliate that owns more than 1,000 miles of natural gas
    gathering lines servicing the Marcellus. The acquisition also
    provides assets in Michigan, which include Antrim Shale
    producing assets and approximately 380,000 total acres in the
    Antrim and Collingwood/Utica Shale.

b)    

Other
    Americas  

Other Americas  is composed of Canada, Greenland,
    Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.
    Net oil-equivalent production from these countries averaged
    247,000 barrels per day during 2010, including the
    company s share of synthetic oil production.

Canada:  Company activities in Canada include nonoperated working interests of 26.9 percent in the Hibernia Field and 26.6 percent in the Hebron Field, both offshore eastern Canada, and 20 percent in both the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) and the AOSP Expansion 1 Project. Average net  oil-equivalent  production during 2010 was 54,000 barrels per day, composed of 53,000 barrels of crude oil, synthetic oil and natural gas liquids and 4 million cubic feet of natural gas.   The company s 2010 production from the Hibernia Field averaged 28,000 barrels per day. The working interest owners are pursuing development of the Hibernia Southern Extension (HSE) unitized blocks. Binding agreements were signed in February 2010 with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador on the development of the HSE unitized area, providing Chevron with a 23.6 percent nonoperated working interest. First 

production from the HSE unitized area is expected in late 2011.
    At the end of 2010, proved reserves had not been recognized for
    the unitized blocks.

FEED commenced in third quarter 2010 for the development of the
    heavy-oil Hebron Field. The project has an expected economic
    life of 30 years. At the end of 2010, proved reserves had
    not been recognized for this project.

At AOSP, the company s production of synthetic oil averaged
    24,000 barrels per day during 2010, including first
    production from the Jackpine Mine in third quarter 2010 as a
    result of AOSP Expansion 1 Project activities. The project is
    expected to increase total daily maximum design capacity by
    100,000 barrels, to more than 255,000 barrels per day
    in early 2011. Oil sands are mined from both the Muskeg River
    and Jackpine mines and bitumen is extracted from the oil sands
    and upgraded into synthetic oil. Expansion of the Scotford
    Upgrader, also part of the AOSP Expansion 1 Project, is expected
    to be completed in first-half 2011.

Brazil:  Chevron holds working interests in three deepwater blocks in the Campos Basin. Chevron also holds a nonoperated working interest in one deepwater block in the Santos Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in 2010 averaged 24,000 barrels per day.  During 2010, development drilling continued at the 51.7 percent-owned and operated Frade Field, located  in the Campos Basin. Further development drilling is expected to add 
five development wells and three injection wells to the field by the end of 2011. The concession that includes the Frade project expires in 2025.  In the partner-operated Campos Basin Block BC-20, two areas   37.5 percent-owned Papa-Terra and 30 percent-owned Maromba   were retained for development following the end of the exploration phase of this block. A final investment decision for the Papa-Terra project was made in January 2010. Major construction contracts were awarded in 2010, and development drilling is expected to 

begin in the second-half 2011. The facility is expected to
    produce up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. First
    production is expected in 2013. Evaluation of the field
    development concept for Maromba continued into 2011. At the end
    of 2010, proved reserves had not been recognized for these
    projects.

In the Santos Basin, evaluation of investment options continued
    into 2011 for the 20 percent-owned and partner-operated
    Atlanta and Oliva fields. At the end of 2010, proved reserves
    had not been recognized for these deepwater fields.

Colombia:  The company operates the offshore Chuchupa
    and the onshore Ballena and Riohacha natural gas fields as part
    of the Guajira Association contract. In exchange, Chevron
    receives 43 percent of the production for the remaining
    life of each field and a variable production volume from a
    fixed-fee, Build-Operate-Maintain-Transfer agreement based on
    prior Chuchupa capital contributions. During 2010, the company
    conducted a seismic survey of the offshore,
     near-shore 
    and onshore development areas. Daily net production averaged
    249 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2010.

    day, composed of 54,000 barrels of crude oil, synthetic oil
    and natural gas liquids and 25 million cubic feet of
    natural gas.

In February 2010, a Chevron-led consortium was selected to
    participate in a heavy-oil project in three blocks within the
    Carabobo Area of eastern Venezuela s Orinoco Belt. A joint
    operating company, Petroindependencia, was formed in
    May 2010, and work toward commercialization of the Carabobo
    3 Project was initiated. The consortium holds a combined
    40 percent interest in the project, with Petr leos de
    Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuela s national crude oil and
    natural gas company, holding the remaining interest.
    Chevron s interest in the project is 34 percent.

The company operates in two exploratory blocks in the Plataforma
    Deltana area offshore eastern Venezuela, with working interests
    of 60 percent in Block 2 and 100 percent in
    Block 3. Chevron also holds a 100 percent operated
    interest in the Cardon III exploratory block, located north
    of Lake Maracaibo in the Gulf of Venezuela. PDVSA has the option
    to increase its ownership in each of the three company-operated
    blocks up to 35 percent upon declaration of commerciality.
    In Block 2, which includes the Loran Field, a Declaration
    of Commerciality was accepted by the Venezuelan government in
    March 2010. The Loran Field in Block 2 is projected to
    provide the initial natural gas supply for a planned Delta
    Caribe liquefied natural gas plant, Venezuela s first LNG
    project. Chevron has a 10 percent nonoperated working
    interest in the LNG facility. At the end of 2010, proved

c)    

Africa  

In Africa, the company is engaged in exploration and production
    activities in Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    Liberia, Nigeria and Republic of the Congo. Net oil-equivalent
    production in Africa averaged 469,000 barrels per day
    during 2010.

Angola:  Chevron holds company-operated working interests in offshore Blocks 0 and 14 and nonoperated working interests in offshore Block 2 and the onshore Fina Sonangol Texaco (FST) area. Net production from these operations in 2010 averaged 161,000 barrels of  oil-equivalent  per day.   The company operates the 39.2 percent-owned Block 0, which averaged 116,000 barrels per day of net liquids production in 2010. The Block 0 concession extends through 2030.   Development of the Mafumeira Field in Block 0 continued in 2010. A development drilling program was completed in the northern section and achieved maximum total crude oil and condensate production of 57,000 barrels per day in fourth quarter 2010. FEED started in January 2010 on Mafumeira Sul, a project to develop the southern portion of the Mafumeira Field. A final investment decision is expected in fourth quarter 2011. Maximum total production fro
m Mafumeira Sul is expected to be 110,000 barrels of crude oil and 10,000 barrels of LPG per day. At year-end 2010, no proved reserves had been recognized for the Mafumeira Sul project.

In the Greater Vanza/Longui Area of Block 0, development
    concept selection studies continued in 2010 with the start of
    FEED planned for second quarter 2011. FEED activities continued
    on the south extension of the N Dola field development

with a final investment decision expected in fourth quarter
    2011. At year-end 2010, no proved reserves had been recognized
    for these projects.

In Block 0, the Area A gas management projects are designed
    to eliminate routine flaring of natural gas by injecting excess
    natural gas into various reservoirs. Three of the four projects
    are in service and have reduced flaring by approximately
    65 million cubic feet per day, as of year-end 2010. The
    Malongo Flare and Relief Modification Project is scheduled for
     start-up  in
    fourth quarter 2011. In Area B, work continued during the year
    on the Nemba Enhanced Secondary Recovery and Flare Reduction

The expansion in Area 12 was completed in 2010 with the
    additional drilling of 72 production, 24 steam injection, and 10
    observation wells. During the year,
     ramp-up  of
    steam injection continued with the project reaching a maximum
    total daily production of 45,000 barrels in September 2010.
    A final investment decision regarding North Duri Area 13 was
    reached May 2010, and is awaiting final development plan and bid
    award approvals from the government of Indonesia. The Rokan PSC
    expires in 2021.

In 2010, Chevron advanced its development plans for the
    Gendalo-Gehem deepwater natural gas project located in the Kutei
    Basin, awarding major FEED contracts for the floating production
    units, subsea and pipeline components, and onshore receiving
    facility. Maximum daily total production from the project is
    expected to be 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and
    31,000 barrels of condensate. Completion of FEED is
    dependent upon government approvals and achieving project
    milestones. The Bangka deepwater natural gas project progressed
    during the year, and entered FEED in fourth quarter 2010. During
    2010, the company reached an agreement to farm-out a portion of
    its working interest in the PSCs of the two projects. Government
    approval of the farm-out is expected in the second-half 2011. In
    addition, in 2011 the company expects to farm-in an Indonesian
    company to the PSCs for the two projects. Following government
    approval of the agreements, the company s production
    interest in the Gendalo-Gehem and Bangka projects will be
    55.1 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Proved
    reserves have not been recognized for these projects.

Also in the Kutei Basin, the company reached a final investment
    decision in August 2010 for an oil development project in the
    West Seno Field and recognized proved reserves related to the
    project.

A drilling campaign continued through 2010 in South Natuna Sea
    Block B to provide additional supply for long-term natural gas
    sales contracts, with additional development drilling planned
    for 2011. The North Belut development project achieved maximum
    total daily production of 240 million cubic feet of natural
    gas and 33,000 barrels of liquids in February 2010.
    Development of the South Belut project continued during the
    year. The Bawal project reached final investment decision in
    October 2010 and is expected to begin production in 2012.

Exploration activities continued in the Central Sumatra Basin
    during 2010. Two wells drilled in the Rokan Block were
    successful and placed on production. Additional appraisal
    drilling near the Duri Field identified further expansion
    opportunities that will be further assessed with
     3-D  seismic
    in 2011. Chevron s operated working interests in two
    exploration blocks in western Papua, West Papua I and West Papua
    III, were reduced to 51 percent in second quarter 2010.
    Geological studies of the two blocks continued in 2010, and
     2-D  seismic
    acquisition is expected to start in the first-half 2011.

Australia  

In Australia, the company s exploration and production
    efforts are concentrated off the northwest coast. During 2010,
    the average net oil-equivalent production from Australia was
    111,000 barrels per day.

Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture offshore Western Australia. Daily net production from the project during 2010 averaged 25,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 456 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 5,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 70 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Japan, South Korea and China, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas was sold to the Western Australia domestic market.  The NWS Venture continues to progress two major capital projects   North Rankin 2 and NWS Oil Redevelopment. The North Rankin 2 project is designed to recover remaining low-pressure natural gas from the North Rankin and Perseus natural gas fields to meet gas supply needs. Modifications for process tie-ins and a barge link from North Rankin A progressed during 2010. Upon completion, North Rankin A and B are designed to be operated as a single integra
ted facility. The project is scheduled to start 

production in 2013. Proved reserves have been recognized for the
    project.

Work also progressed on the NWS Oil Redevelopment Project, which
    is designed to replace the existing FPSO vessel and a portion of
    existing subsea infrastructure that services production from the
    Cossack, Hermes, Lambert and Wanaea offshore fields. Work
    commenced in January 2011 on the subsea infrastructure
    refurbishment, and construction of the new FPSO vessel is
    expected to be completed in second quarter 2011. The project is
    expected to start up in third quarter 2011 and extend production
    past 2020.

The NWS Venture continues to progress additional gas supply
    opportunities through development of several small fields on the
    western flank of the Goodwyn reservoirs. The project is expected
    to enter FEED in the first-half 2011. The concession for the NWS
    Venture expires in 2034.

On Barrow and Thevenard islands off the northwest coast of

Chevron has signed five binding LNG Sales and Purchase
    Agreements (SPAs) with Asian customers for delivery of about
    4.7 million metric tons of LNG per year. Negotiations
    continue to finalize the two remaining nonbinding Heads of
    Agreement (HOAs) to binding SPAs, which would bring LNG delivery
    commitments to a combined total of about 90 percent of
    Chevron s share of LNG from the project. Construction on
    Barrow Island and other activities for the project progressed
    during 2010 with the awarding of approximately $25 billion
    of contracts for materials and services, clearing of the plant
    site, completion of the first stage of the construction village,
    commencement of module fabrication, and progression of studies
    on the possible expansion of the project. Proved reserves have
    been recognized for the Greater Gorgon Area fields included in
    the project, and first production of natural gas from the fields
    is expected in 2014. The project s estimated economic life
    exceeds 40 years from the time of
     start-up. 

FEED activities for the company s majority-owned and
    operated Wheatstone Project continued in 2010. Chevron holds an

    processing facilities, which include a two-train
    8.9 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility and a separate
    domestic gas plant located at Ashburton North, along the
    northwest coast of Australia. The company plans to supply
    natural gas to the facilities from two Chevron-operated licenses
    comprising the majority of the Wheatstone Field and the nearby
    Iago Field.

Through the end of 2010, Chevron has signed nonbinding HOAs with
    three Asian customers for the delivery of about 80 percent
    of Chevron s net LNG offtake from the Wheatstone Project.
    Under these HOAs, the customers also agreed to acquire a
    combined 21.8 percent nonoperated working interest in the
    Wheatstone field licenses and a 17.5 percent interest in
    the foundation natural gas processing facilities at the time of
    the final investment decision. Negotiations continue to move the
    three nonbinding HOAs to binding SPAs with these customers.
    Agreements were also signed in 2009 and amended in 2010 with two
    companies to participate in the Wheatstone Project as combined
    20 percent LNG facility owners and suppliers of natural gas
    for the project s first two LNG trains. During 2010, a
    Native Title Heads of Agreement was reached with the local
    indigenous people for the land required at Ashburton North and
    submissions were made for various additional environmental
    approvals. The final investment decision for the project is
    expected in
     second-half 
    2011. At the end of 2010, the company had not recognized proved
    reserves for this project.

In the Browse Basin, the Browse LNG development participants
    commenced design evaluation for the Brecknock, Calliance and
    Torosa fields in early 2010. At the end of 2010, proved reserves

    150 company-operated service stations into retailer-owned
    sites in various countries outside the United States.

Chevron markets commercial aviation fuel at approximately 200
    airports, worldwide. The company also markets an extensive line
    of lubricant and coolant products under brand names including
    Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa and Taro.

Chemicals
    Operations  

Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in its Chevron Phillips
    Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) affiliate. At the end of 2010,
    CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 36 manufacturing
    facilities and four research and technical centers around the
    world.

During 2010, CPChem commenced operations at its
    49 percent-owned Q-Chem II project in both Mesaieed
    and Ras Laffan, Qatar. The project includes a
    350,000-metric-ton-per-year high-density polyethylene plant and
    a
     345,000-metric-ton-per-year 
    normal alpha olefins plant in Mesaieed, each utilizing
    CPChem s proprietary technology. Also included in the
    project is a separate joint venture for a
    1.3 million-metric-ton-per-year ethylene cracker in Ras
    Laffan, in which
     Q-Chem II 
    owns 54 percent of the capacity rights, which will provide
    ethylene feedstock to the high-density polyethylene and normal
    alpha olefins plants.

CPChem s 35 percent-owned Saudi Polymers Company
    continued construction on a petrochemical project in Al Jubail,
    Saudi Arabia. The joint-venture project includes olefins,
    polyethylene, polypropylene, 1-hexene and polystyrene units.
    Project
     start-up  is
    expected in late 2011.

In the United States, CPChem announced in fourth quarter 2010
    the development of a 200,000-ton-per-year 1-hexene plant at the
    company s Cedar Bayou complex in Baytown, Texas, with
     start-up 
    expected in 2014. The plant is expected to be the largest
    1-hexene unit in the world and will utilize CPChem s
    proprietary 1-hexene technology.

Chevron s Oronite brand lubricant and fuel additives
    business is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels. The
    company owns and operates facilities in Brazil, France, Japan,
    the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States and has equity
    interests in facilities in India and Mexico. Oronite lubricant
    additives are blended into refined base oil to produce finished
    lubricant packages used primarily in engine applications, such
    as passenger car, heavy-duty diesel, marine, locomotive and
    motorcycle engines, and additives for fuels that are blended to
    improve engine performance and extend engine life. During 2010,
    the company achieved full capacity at the detergent expansion
    facility in Singapore. This additional capacity enhances the
    company s ability to produce detergent components for
    applications in marine and automotive engines.

5 

Includes the company s share of West Africa Gas Pipeline.

During 2010, the company completed a project to expand capacity
    by approximately 2 billion cubic feet at the Keystone
    natural gas storage facility near Midland, Texas, bringing total
    capacity to nearly 7 billion cubic feet.

Work continued in 2010 to bring the Cal-Ky Pipeline, which was
    decommissioned in 2002, back into crude oil service as a supply
    line for the Pascagoula Refinery. This crude oil pipeline is
    also expected to provide additional outlets for the
    company s equity production. The pipeline is expected to
    return to service in 2012. The company is leading the
    construction of a 136 mile,
     24-inch 
    pipeline from the Jack/St. Malo facility to Green Canyon 19 in
    the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where there is an interconnect to
    pipelines delivering crude oil into Louisiana.

In 2010, the company sold its 23.4 percent ownership
    interest in the Colonial Pipeline Company, which transports
    products from supply centers on the U.S. Gulf Coast to
    customers located along the Eastern seaboard.

Refer to pages 16, 17 and 18 in the Upstream section for
    information on the Chad/Cameroon pipeline, the West Africa Gas
    Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Western Route

Tankers chartered for more than one year.

Federal law requires that cargo transported between
    U.S. ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
    United States, owned and operated by U.S. entities,
    and manned by U.S. crews. The company s
     U.S.-flagged 
    fleet is engaged primarily in transporting refined products
    between the Gulf Coast and the East Coast and from California
    refineries to terminals on the West Coast and in Alaska and
    Hawaii. As part of its fleet modernization program, the company
    replaced two
     U.S.-flagged 
    product tankers in 2010. The company plans to retire one
    additional
     U.S.-flagged 
    product tanker in 2011. The new tankers are expected to bring
    improved efficiencies to Chevron s
     U.S.-flagged 
    fleet.

The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in
    transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the
    Black Sea, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States,
    Europe, Australia and Asia. The company s
     foreign-flagged 
    vessels also transport refined products to and from various
    locations worldwide.

In addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
    one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural gas
    tankers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf Venture in
    Australia.

Chevron s fleet of owned and chartered tankers is
    completely double-hulled. The company is a member of many
     oil-spill-response 
    cooperatives in areas in which it operates around the world.

Other
    Businesses  

Mining  

Chevron s
     U.S.-based 
    mining company produces and markets coal and molybdenum. Sales
    occur in both U.S. and international markets.

The company owns and is the operator of an underground coal
    mine, North River, in Alabama, and surface coal mines in
    Kemmerer, Wyoming, and McKinley, New Mexico. The company also
    owns a 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining Company,
    LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern Wyoming.

As of early 2011, the sale of the North River Mine and other
    coal-related assets in Alabama was under negotiation.
    Additionally, in January 2011, the company announced the intent
    to divest its remaining coal mining operations. Activities
    related to full reclamation continued in 2010 at the
    company s McKinley, New Mexico, mine, which ceased coal
    production at the end of 2009.

At year-end 2010, Chevron controlled approximately
    189 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in
    the United States, including reserves of low-sulfur coal.
    The company is contractually committed to deliver between
    7 million and 8 million tons of coal per year through
    the end of 2013 and believes it will satisfy these contracts
    from existing coal reserves. Coal sales from wholly owned mines
    in 2010 were 8 million tons, down about 2 million tons
    from 2009.

In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates
    the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At
     year-end 
    2010, Chevron controlled approximately 53 million pounds of
    proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Production and underground
    development at Questa continued at reduced levels in 2010 in
    response to weak prices for molybdenum.

Power
    Generation  

Chevron s Global Power Company manages interests in 13
    power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100
    megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States
    and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and
    gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize waste heat
    recovery to produce electricity and support industrial thermal
    hosts. The thirteenth facility is a wind farm, located in
    Casper, Wyoming, that is designed to optimize the use of a
    decommissioned refinery site for delivery of clean, renewable
    energy to the local utility.

The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the
    Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
    technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its
    renewable-energy strategy. For additional information on the
    company s geothermal operations and renewable energy
    projects, refer to pages 21 and 22 and  Research and
    Technology  below.

Chevron

CES is a wholly owned subsidiary that develops and builds
    sustainable energy projects to increase energy efficiency and
    renewable power, reduce energy costs, and ensure reliable,
    high-quality energy for government, education and business
    facilities. Since 2000, CES has developed hundreds of projects
    that help customers reduce their energy costs and environmental
    impact. Projects announced in 2010 include the City of Brea
    Energy Efficiency and Solar Project in California, the Marine
    Corps Logistics Base Albany Landfill Gas Project in Georgia, and
    the University of Utah Thermal Storage and New Central Plant
    Project.

Research
    and Technology  

The company s energy technology organization supports
    Chevron s upstream and downstream businesses by providing
    technology, services and competency development in earth
    sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and
    completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process
    technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health,
    environment and safety disciplines. The information technology
    organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data
    management, security and network technology to provide a
    standardized digital infrastructure and enable Chevron s
    global operations and business processes.

Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and
    projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
    into Chevron s core businesses. As of the end of 2010, CTV
    continued to explore technologies such as next-generation
    biofuels and advanced solar. In 2010, the company constructed
    and commissioned a one megawatt concentrating photovoltaic (CPV)
    solar facility on the tailing site of Chevron s molybdenum
    mine in Questa, New Mexico. This beneficial reuse project
    is one of the largest CPV installations in the world. Also in
    2010, the company constructed and commissioned a 0.74 megawatt
    next generation solar photovoltaic installation on a former
    refinery site in Bakersfield, California. Seven solar panel
    technologies are being tested to establish the viability of
    these solar technologies at other Chevron sites.

Chevron s research and development expenses were
    $526 million, $603 million and $702 million for
    the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
    above are in new or unproven technologies and business
    processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are
    not certain.

Environmental
    Protection  

Virtually all aspects of the company s businesses are
    subject to various U.S. federal, state and local
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and
    to similar laws and regulations in other countries. These
    regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
    number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
    the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
    sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
    regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to
    become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business.

In 2010, the company s U.S. capitalized environmental
    expenditures were $639 million, representing about
    12 percent of the company s total consolidated
    U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These
    environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
    existing facilities as well as those associated with new
    facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and
    water-quality projects and activities at the company s
    refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
    facilities. For 2011, the company estimates U.S. capital
    expenditures for environmental control facilities will be

30

Table of Contents   

approximately $800 million. The future annual capital costs
    are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
    future changes to regulatory requirements.

Environmental-related regulations, including those intended to
    address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global
    climate change, continue to evolve. For instance, in December
    2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued
    a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, which found
    that emissions of six greenhouse gases threaten the public
    health and welfare. Greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and
    engines also contribute to such pollution. Subsequently, in
    2010, the EPA finalized two regulations under the Clean Air Act
    that establish greenhouse gas emission standards for new
    light-duty vehicles and clarify preconstruction permitting
    requirements for new or modified stationary source facilities
    with greenhouse gas emissions that exceed 75,000 tons per year
    of carbon dioxide equivalent. In November 2010, the agency
    issued updated guidance on determining the  best available
    control technologies  (BACT) that would be required to be
    implemented by certain new and modified stationary source
    facilities beginning in January 2011, but there remains
    significant uncertainty regarding the impact of applying BACT
    requirements on a case by case basis. Finally, in two recent
    settlement agreements, the EPA agreed to schedules for
    undertaking additional greenhouse gas rulemakings applicable to
    utilities and refineries. The agency is beginning to develop
    these new regulations, which are scheduled to be effective in
    May 2012 (utilities) and November 2012 (refineries), so it is
    not possible to predict their impact at this time. The
    EPA s endangerment finding, motor vehicle greenhouse gas
    standards, and greenhouse gas permit rule have all been
    challenged in federal courts and decisions are pending.

The EPA also finalized its revised Renewable Fuel Standard
    (RFS2) regulations as required by the Energy Independence and
    Security Act of 2007. The regulations require fuel providers to
    blend increased volumes of renewable fuels into gasoline and
    diesel each year and establish specific greenhouse gas reduction
    and feedstock criteria for subcategories of renewable fuel,
    including cellulosic fuel, advanced biofuel and biomass-based
    diesel. The specific impacts of this regulation are determined
    by many factors, including fluctuating markets for renewable
    fuels and EPA regulatory decisions on potential waivers of
    volume requirements.

Additionally, under California s Global Warming Solutions
    Act, enacted in 2006, the California Air Resources Board (CARB),
    charged with implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon
    fuel standard intended to reduce the carbon intensity of
    transportation fuels. The state is behind schedule in completing
    certain elements of the standard. Consequently, initial carbon
    intensity reduction requirements are effective as of January
    2011, but CARB has delayed other aspects of compliance until it
    completes further updates to the regulation later in the year.
    In December 2010, CARB adopted regulations implementing the cap
    and trade program requirements of the Global Warming Solutions
    Act. The first compliance period of the cap and trade program
    begins in 2012 and ends in December 2014. CARB has yet to
    develop detailed regulations to implement this portion of the
    Act, including the determination of how emissions allowances
    will be allocated and traded during this period. The effect of
    any such regulation on the company s business is uncertain.

    impact on Chevron and on the company s 2010 environmental
    expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
    reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 32

Item 1A.    

Risk
    Factors  

Chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business
    portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating
    sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and
    to pay dividends. Nevertheless, some inherent risks could
    materially impact the company s financial results of
    operations or financial condition.

Chevron
    is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
    prices.   

Chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
    price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the
    company s results of operations is the price of crude oil,
    which can be influenced by general economic conditions and
    geopolitical risk. Chevron accepts the risk of changing
    commodity prices as part of its business planning process. As
    such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure
    to fluctuations in crude oil prices.

During extended periods of historically low prices for crude
    oil, the company s upstream earnings and capital and
    exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected.
    Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on
    downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for
    refined products and the associated margins on refined product
    sales.

The
    scope of Chevron s business will decline if the company
    does not successfully develop resources.   

The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron
    is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
    produces with good prospects for future production or through
    acquisitions, the company s business will decline. Creating
    and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many
    factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore,
    develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to
    bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion
    on budget and schedule; and efficient and profitable operation
    of mature properties.

The
    company s operations could be disrupted by natural or human
    factors.   

Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
    inhospitable regions. The company s operations and
    facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
    natural or human causes beyond its control, including
    hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil
    unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes,
    explosions and system failures, any of which could result in
    suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural
    environment.

The
    company s operations have inherent risks and hazards that
    require significant and continuous oversight.   

Chevron s results depend on its ability to identify and
    mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the
    crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to
    minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and
    building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe
    and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks
    effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including
    releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in
    personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of
    revenues, legal liability
     and/or 
    disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains
    a system of policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to
    manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency
    risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies;
    and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents.
    Nonetheless, in certain situations where Chevron is not the
    operator, the company may have limited influence and control
    over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and
    control such risks.

Chevron s
    business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation
    or government action.   

The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
    with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
    of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
    company s business. Chevron operations also produce
    byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these
    operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the
    company may have limited influence and control. Any of these
    activities could result in liability arising from private
    litigation or government action, either as a result of an
    accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
    on the effects of the company s operations on human health
    or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal
    pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is
    possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to
    the company s causation of or contribution to the asserted
    damage, or to other mitigating factors.

32

Table of Contents   

Political
    instability could harm Chevron s business.   

The company s operations, particularly exploration and
    production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
    political environments in the various countries in which it
    operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
    governments to increase public ownership of the company s
    partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional
    taxes or royalties.

In certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
    controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
    existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
    company s continued presence in those countries. Internal
    unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
    government and the company or other governments may affect
    the company s operations. Those developments have, at
    times, significantly affected the company s related
    operations and results and are carefully considered by
    management when evaluating the level of current and future
    activity in such countries. At December 31, 2010,
    25 percent of the company s net proved reserves were
    located in Kazakhstan. The company also has significant
    interests in Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
    (OPEC)-member countries including Angola, Nigeria and
    Venezuela and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and
    Kuwait. Twenty-three percent of the company s net proved
    reserves, including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries
    at December 31, 2010.

Regulation
    of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevron s
    operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron s
    products.   

Continued political attention to issues concerning climate
    change, the role of human activity in it, and potential
    mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on
    the company s operations and financial results.

International agreements and national or regional legislation
    and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are
    currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. For
    instance, the Kyoto Protocol and California s Global
    Warming Solutions Act, along with other actual or pending
    federal, state and provincial regulations, envision a reduction
    of greenhouse gas emissions through market-based regulatory
    programs, technology-based or performance-based standards or a
    combination of them. The company is subject to existing
    greenhouse gas emissions limits in jurisdictions where such
    regulation is currently effective, including the European Union
    and New Zealand.

In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    finalized two regulations under the Clean Air Act that establish
    greenhouse gas emission standards for new light-duty vehicles
    and clarify preconstruction permitting requirements for new or
    modified stationary source facilities with greenhouse gas
    emissions that exceed 75,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide
    equivalent. In addition, the EPA recently agreed to develop
    additional regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from
    utilities and refineries. The agency is beginning to develop
    these new regulations, which are scheduled to be effective in
    May 2012 (utilities) and November 2012 (refineries), so it is
    not possible to predict their impact at this time.

The U.S. Congress has previously considered and may in the
    future consider legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions. At this time it is not possible to predict any
    specific Congressional actions in 2011 or beyond, and it is
    unclear how any such legislation would reconcile with the Clean
    Air Act or current EPA regulations.

In December 2010, California adopted regulations implementing
    the cap and trade program requirements of the state s
    Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB32. The first
    compliance period of the cap and trade program begins in 2012
    and ends in December 2014. Chevron may incur costs associated
    with emissions reduction activities, and the purchase of
    allowances or credits for its facilities in California. In
    addition, Chevron s purchased energy costs from utilities
    may increase starting in January 2012, when electricity
    generators are required to purchase allowances or credits for
    electricity sold in California.

These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies
    and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance,
    operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure
    required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain
    and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws
    enacted in each jurisdiction, the company s activities in
    it and market conditions. The company s exploration and
    production of crude oil, natural gas and various minerals such
    as coal; the upgrading of production from oil sands into
    synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and
    natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction
    and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude
    oil, natural gas and related products and consumers  or
    customers  use of the company s products result in
    greenhouse gas emissions that could well be regulated. Some of
    these activities, such as consumers  and customers 
    use of the company s products, as well as actions taken by
    the company s competitors in response to such laws and
    regulations, are beyond the company s control.

The effect of regulation on the company s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors including, among
    others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions
    reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would

33

Changes
    in management s estimates and assumptions may have a
    material impact on the company s consolidated financial
    statements and financial or operations performance in any given
    period.   

In preparing the company s periodic reports under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial
    statements, Chevron s management is required under
    applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and
    assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and
    assumptions are based on management s best estimates and
    experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk
    and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as
    circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
    Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by
    management include measurement of benefit obligations for
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of
    crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for
    estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and
    impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in
    estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the
    assumptions, such as changes in the company s business
    plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices,
    could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Item 3.      

Legal
    Proceedings  

Ecuador  

Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the Superior
    Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003
    by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain
    residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly
    had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment
    from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks
    unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and
    restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health
    monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company
    (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of
    this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned
    oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations
    have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of
    the consortium and following an independent third-party
    environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into
    a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador
    for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the
    government in proportion to Texpet s ownership share of the
    consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a
    three-year remediation program at a cost of $40 million.
    After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the
    government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a
    full release from any and all environmental liability arising
    from the consortium operations.

Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this
    lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the
    company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over
    Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the
    action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third,
    that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
    Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the
    releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the
    Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent
    provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts,
    the company believes that the evidence confirms that
    Texpet s remediation was properly conducted and that the
    remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador s
    failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and
    Petroecuador s further conduct since assuming full control
    over the operations.

In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify
    and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify
    steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that
    the court assess $18.9 billion, which would, according to
    the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported
    damages, including wrongful death claims, and

34

Table of Contents   

pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health
    care systems and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The
    engineer s report also asserted that an additional
    $8.4 billion could be assessed against Chevron for unjust
    enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of
    evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which
    businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
    government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome,
    the judge presiding over the case was recused. In 2010, Chevron
    moved to strike the mining engineer s report and to dismiss
    the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the
    United States indicating that the report was prepared by
    consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the
    mining engineer s independent and impartial work and
    showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the
    judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the
    mining engineer s report and requiring the parties to
    provide their positions on damages within 45 days. Chevron
    subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that
    he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he
    had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory
    time requirement.

In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages,
    asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. The
    plaintiffs  submission, which relied in part on the mining
    engineer s report, took the position that damages are
    between approximately $16 billion and $76 billion and
    that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between
    approximately $5 billion and $38 billion. The next
    day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of
    the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the
    case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron
    petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of
    Chevron s prior recusal petition, and because procedural
    and evidentiary matters remain unresolved. In October 2010,
    Chevron s motion to recuse the judge was granted. A new
    judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge s
    order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On
    December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the
    evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he
    had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment.

Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009
    against the Republic of Ecuador before the Permanent Court of
    Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations
    Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges
    violations of the Republic of Ecuador s obligations under
    the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and
    breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the
    Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are
    investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the
    arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the
    Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment
    against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a
    violation of Ecuador s obligations under the BIT. On
    February 9, 2011, the Permanent Court of Arbitration issued
    an Order for Interim Measures requiring the Republic of Ecuador
    to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be
    suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without
    Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case
    pending further order of the Tribunal. Chevron expects to
    continue seeking permanent injunctive relief and monetary relief
    before the Tribunal.

Through a series of recent U.S. court proceedings initiated
    by Chevron to obtain discovery relating to the Lago Agrio
    litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron has obtained
    evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion,
    corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers,
    consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In
    February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal
    District Court for the Southern District of New York
    against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers,
    consultants and supporters alleging violations of the Racketeer
    Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws.
    Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that
    includes an award of damages and a declaration that any judgment
    against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of
    fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable.
    On February 8, 2011, the Court issued a temporary
    restraining order prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and
    persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in
    furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment
    against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case until March 8, 2011.
    Chevron s motion for a preliminary injunction is presently
    before the Court.

On February 14, 2011, the Provincial Court in Lago Agrio
    rendered an adverse judgment in the case. The Provincial Court
    rejected Chevron s defenses to the extent the Court
    addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assesses
    approximately $8.6 billion in damages and about $0.9 billion for
    the plaintiffs  representatives. It also assesses an
    additional amount of approximately $8.6 billion in punitive
    damages unless the company provides a public apology. Chevron
    continues to believe the Court s judgment is illegitimate
    and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other
    countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product
    of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence.
    Chevron will appeal this decision in Ecuador. Chevron cannot
    predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in
    Ecuador. Chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any
    imposition of liability. Because Chevron has no substantial
    assets in Ecuador, Chevron would expect enforcement actions as a
    result of this judgment to be brought in other jurisdictions.
    Chevron expects to contest any such actions.

The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any
    financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does
    not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a
    range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects

35

Table of Contents   

associated with the judgment, the 2008 engineer s report
    and the September 2010 plaintiffs  submission, management
    does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating
    a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the
    highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides
    no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss
    (or a range of loss).

California
    Air Resources Board  

As reported in the company s annual report on
     Form 10-K 
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, in November 2008, the
    California Air Resources Board (CARB) proposed a civil penalty
    against the company s Sacramento, California, terminal for
    alleged violations between August and December 2007 of
    CARB s regulations governing the minimum concentration of
    additives in gasoline. Due to a computer programming error, the
    Sacramento terminal s automatic dispensers had failed to
    inject additive detergent into a gasoline line.

As reported in the company s annual report on
     Form 10-K 
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, in November 2008,
    CARB proposed a civil penalty against the company s
    Richmond, California, refinery for a notice of violation
    relating to gasoline that was not properly certified as to
    composition. The company corrected the composition certificates
    for the gasoline without requiring any change to the composition
    of the gasoline. In July 2009, CARB issued the refinery a notice
    of violation relating to an error in gasoline blending that
    caused the product composition certifications to be in error.
    The composition certifications were corrected without requiring
    any change to the gasoline. Discussions with CARB officials
    relating to all of these matters continue.

As reported in the company s quarterly report on
     Form 10-Q 
    for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, on July 14,
    2009, CARB issued a notice of violation against Chevron Products
    Company for alleged violations of CARB s regulations
    governing the certification of gasoline that occurred during
    storage at a third-party facility and which had been
    self-reported by the company on discovery. The company has
    determined that resolution of this matter may result in the
    payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.

Other
    Government Proceedings  

As reported in the company s annual report on
     Form 10-K 
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, in July 2009, the
    Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is
    obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding $100,000
    in conjunction with commitments the company undertook to install
    and operate certain air pollution abatement equipment at its
    Hawaii Refinery pursuant to Clean Air Act settlement with the
    United States Environmental Protection Agency and DOH. The
    company has disputed many of the allegations.

As reported in the company s quarterly report on
     Form 10-Q 
    for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, in March 2010, the
    United States Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated that it
    intends to seek a civil penalty against the company s
    service station operations in Puerto Rico for alleged violations
    of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico s underground storage
    tank regulations. The alleged violations include failure to test
    leak detectors, perform release monitoring and maintain
    compliance records. The DOJ s action may result in payment
    of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.

As reported in the company s quarterly report on
     Form 10-Q 
    for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, Chevron has entered
    into negotiations with the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to alleged air pollution
    violations at the company s Perth Amboy, New Jersey
    refinery identified in a September 16, 2008 Compliance
    Order issued by the EPA. The alleged violations relate to
    certain management and reporting requirements set forth in the
    EPA s Leak Detection and Repair regulations (these
    regulations pertain to the control and monitoring of fugitive
    emissions from refinery process equipment). Based on discussions
    with the EPA, it appears that the resolution of this matter will
    result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.

In the fourth quarter 2010, Chevron paid the United States
    Department of Transportation a $423,000 civil penalty as the
    result of an 800 barrel crude oil spill that occurred on
    June 12, 2010. The spill originated from a pipeline that
    runs from the company s Rangely Colorado Field to its Salt
    Lake Refinery.

The California Attorney General has alleged violations of the
    State s underground storage tank regulations at the
    company s service stations in the State of California. The
    allegations are part of a state-wide enforcement action which
    the company determined in the fourth quarter 2010 may
    result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Key Financial Results 

Earnings by Major Operating Area 

The activities reported in Chevron s upstream and downstream operating segments have
changed effective January 1, 2010. Results for the chemicals businesses are now reported as part of
the downstream segment. In addition, the company s significant upstream-enabling operations,
primarily a gas-to-liquids project and major international export pipelines, have been reclassified
from the downstream segment to the upstream segment. Prior period information in this report has
been revised to conform to the 2010 presentation.

Refer to the  Results of Operations  section beginning on page FS-7 for a discussion of
financial results by major operating area for the three years ended December 31, 2010.

Business Environment and Outlook 

Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following
countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad,
China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, the
Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned Zone between

Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South
Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela and Vietnam.

Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream
business segments. The single biggest factor that affects the results of operations for both
segments is movement in the price of crude oil. In the downstream business, crude oil is the
largest cost component of refined products. The overall trend in earnings is typically less
affected by results from the company s other activities and investments. Earnings for the company
in any period may also be influenced by events or transactions that are infrequent or unusual in
nature.

The company s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic,
regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the
United States. Civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the
company or other governments may impact the company s operations or investments. Those
developments have at times significantly affected the company s operations and results and are
carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries.

To sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must
develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the
investment required. Identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to
explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many
technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in
this effort. Projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. From time to
time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the
company. Governments may attempt to do so in the future. The company will continue to monitor these
developments, take them into account in evaluating future investment opportunities, and otherwise
seek to mitigate any risks to the company s current operations or future prospects.

The company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to
its asset base to help augment the company s financial performance and growth. Refer to the
 Results of Operations  section beginning on page FS-7 for discussions of net gains on asset sales
during 2010. Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could
result in significant gains or losses.

FS-2 

Table of Contents   

In recent years, Chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in
certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. This
increase in costs affected the company s operating expenses and capital programs for all business
segments, but particularly for Upstream. Softening of these cost pressures started in late 2008 and
continued through most of 2009. Industry costs began to level out in fourth quarter 2009 and rose
slightly in 2010. The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting,
procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs.

The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of
worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude
oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily
operations and for business planning. The company remains confident of its underlying financial
strength to address potential challenges presented in the current environment. (Refer also to the
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  section beginning on page FS-12.)

Comments related to earnings trends for the company s major business areas are as follows:

Upstream   Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over
which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic
conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and
regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil
unrest or political uncertainty. Moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit

the company s production capacity in an affected region. The company monitors developments closely
in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating
its facilities and businesses. Besides the impact of the fluctuation in prices for crude oil and
natural gas, the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other
factors, including the company s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and
natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulations.

Price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the
production of crude oil and natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the company s control. External factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity
prices and prices charged by the industry s material and service providers, which can be affected
by the volatility of the industry s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and
services. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by
damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.

The chart at the left shows the trend in benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The WTI price averaged $79 per barrel for the full-year
2010, compared to $62 in 2009. As of mid-February 2011, the WTI
price was about $85.

A differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur)
crudes and those of lower quality  (low-gravity,  high-sulfur). The amount of the differential in any
period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand, which is a
function of the number of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into
light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). The differential
widened during 2010 primarily due to both strong diesel prices and relatively weaker fuel oil
prices.

Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Chad,
Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in
Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page FS-11 for the company s
average U.S. and international crude oil realizations.)

In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural
gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those
markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged about $4.50 per thousand cubic feet
(MCF) during 2010, compared with about $3.80 during 2009. As of mid-February 2011, the Henry Hub
spot price was about $4.20 per MCF. Fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the United States
are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in North America and
the level of inventory in underground storage.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Certain international natural gas markets in which the company operates have
different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances, which historically have resulted in lower
average sales prices for the company s production of natural gas in these locations. In some of
these locations Chevron is investing in  long-term  projects to install infrastructure to produce and
liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets where greater demand results in higher
prices. International natural gas realizations averaged about $4.60 per MCF during 2010, compared
with about $4.00 per MCF during 2009. These realizations reflect a strong demand for energy in
certain Asian markets. (See page FS-11 for the company s average natural gas realizations for the
U.S. and international regions.)

The company s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2010 averaged 2.763 million barrels
per day. About one-fifth of the company s net oil-equivalent production in 2010 occurred in the
OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Venezuela and the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait. OPEC quotas had no effect on the company s net crude oil production in 2010, while
production in 2009 was reduced by an average of 20,000 barrels per day due to quotas imposed by
OPEC. All of the imposed curtailments took place during the first half of 2009. At the December
2010 meeting, members of OPEC supported maintaining production quotas in effect since December
2008.

The company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2011 will average approximately 2.790
million barrels per day. This estimate is subject to many factors and
uncer-

tainties, including additional quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on production
volumes calculated under production sharing and variable-royalty provisions of certain agreements,
changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project
startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may
shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance
turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions
to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of
economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial
exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in upstream projects generally begin well
in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. A significant
majority of Chevron s upstream investment is made outside the United States.

Refer to the  Results of Operations  section on pages FS-7 through FS-8 for additional
discussion of the company s upstream business.

Refer
to Table V beginning on page FS-71 for a tabulation of the company s proved net oil and
gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2008 and each year-end from 2008 through 2010,
and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the
three-year period ending December 31, 2010.

Gulf of Mexico Update  In April 2010, an accident occurred on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon,
a deepwater drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a loss of life, the sinking of the rig
and a significant oil spill. The rig was drilling an exploratory well at the BP-operated Macondo
prospect. Chevron was not a participant in the well. Subsequent to the event, the U.S. Department
of the Interior put in place a moratorium on the drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers
(BOPs) or surface BOPs on a floating facility in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific regions. In
October 2010, the Secretary of the Interior lifted the drilling moratorium, provided that operators
certify compliance with all the newly expanded rules and requirements, and demonstrate the
availability of adequate blowout containment resources.

The moratorium and the ensuing slowdown in issuing drilling permits since the moratorium was
lifted have resulted in delays in shallow water drilling activity, delayed the drilling of
exploratory deepwater wells and impacted development drilling on both operated and nonoperated
projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The company s daily net oil-equivalent production in the Gulf of
Mexico was reduced by about 10,000 barrels per day for the full year. The company has submitted
several deepwater drilling permit applications and plans to submit additional applications in 2011.
Two deepwater drillships are on stand-by, pending issuance of permits from

FS-4 

Table of Contents   

the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), to drill wells in
the Gulf of Mexico. A third deepwater drillship is drilling a water injection well at the Tahiti
Field. Additionally, the completion of previously drilled wells has recommenced at the nonoperated
Perdido and Caesar/Tonga projects. The future effects of this incident, including any new or
additional regulations that may be adopted and the timing of BOEMRE issuing drilling permits, are
not fully known at this time. Chevron remains committed to deepwater exploration and development in
the Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater basins around the world.

During the moratorium, Chevron
participated in a number of industry efforts to identify opportunities to improve industry
standards in prevention, intervention and spill response. In July 2010, Chevron and several other
companies announced plans to build and deploy a rapid response system that will be available to
capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future well blowout in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico. The new system will be engineered to be used in water depths up to 10,000 feet and
designed to have capacity to contain 100,000 barrels per day, with potential for expansion. The
companies committed to equally fund the initial $1 billion investment in the system. There will be
additional ongoing costs for operations and maintenance of the system components. An initial
agreement to secure containment equipment has been announced, and other equipment is expected to be
secured and available in the coming months, with the new system targeted for completion in early
2012. The companies have formed an organization, the Marine Well Containment Company, to operate
and maintain this system. Other companies have been invited and encouraged to participate in this
organization.

Downstream   Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining,
manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel
oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and
can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and
petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical
feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels,
geopolitical events, cost of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity
utilization, maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from
unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.

Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of the
crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry s demand for crude oil and product
tankers. Other factors beyond the company s control include the general level of inflation and
energy costs to operate the company s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.

The company s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S.
Gulf Coast, Latin

America, Asia, southern Africa and the United Kingdom. Chevron operates or has significant
ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas except Latin America. In third quarter
2010, the company completed its exit from the District of Columbia, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky,
North Carolina, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia
and parts of Tennessee, where the company sold Chevron- and Texaco-branded motor fuels to retail
customers through approximately 1,100 stations, and to commercial and industrial customers through
supply arrangements. Sales in these markets represented approximately 8 percent of the company s
total 2009 U.S. retail fuel sales volumes.

The company s refining and marketing margins in 2010 improved over 2009, but remain
relatively weak due to the economic slowdown, excess refined product supplies and surplus refining
capacity. Expecting these conditions to continue for several years, in first quarter 2010 the
company announced that its downstream businesses would be restructured to improve operating
efficiency and achieve sustained improvement in financial performance. As part of this
restructuring, employee-reduction programs were announced for the United States and international
downstream operations. The initial estimate included approximately 3,200 employees. Due to
redeployment efforts within the company, it is currently expected that approximately 2,800
employees in the downstream operations will be terminated under these programs before the end of
2011. About 1,100 of the affected employees are located in the United States. During 2010, 1,400
employees were terminated worldwide. Refer to Note 23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements,
beginning on page FS-59, for further discussion. In 2010, the company solicited bids for 13 U.S.
terminals and certain operations in Europe (including the company s Pembroke Refinery), the
Caribbean, and select Central America and Africa markets. These sales are part of the company s
ongoing effort to concentrate downstream resources and capital on strategic global assets. These
potential market exits, dispositions of assets, and other actions may result in gains or losses in
future periods. Through fourth quarter 2010, the company completed the sale of six U.S. terminals
and certain marketing businesses in Africa, which resulted in gains that were not material to the
company. Also, in late 2010 the company completed the sale of its 23.4 percent ownership interest
in the Colonial Pipeline Company, which resulted in a gain on sale of nearly $400 million.

Refer to the  Results of Operations  section on page FS-9 for additional discussion of the
company s downstream operations.

All
Other   consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash
management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations,
real estate activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies. In first quarter 2010,
employee-reduction programs were announced for the corporate staffs. As of year-end, it was
expected that approximately 400 employees from the corporate staffs will be terminated under the
programs by the end of 2011, including approximately 100 who were terminated in 2010. Refer to Note
23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-59, for further discussion.

Operating Developments 

Key operating developments and other events during 2010 and early 2011 included the
following:

Upstream 

Australia   Construction activities on Barrow Island and other activities for the Gorgon Project
progressed on schedule during 2010 with the award of approximately $25 billion of contracts for
materials and services, clearing of the plant site,

completion of the first stage of the construction village, commencement of
module fabrication, and progression of studies on the possible expansion
of the project. In early 2011, the company signed an additional binding
liquefied natural gas (LNG) Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with an
Asian customer. The company has signed five binding LNG SPAs with Asian
customers for delivery of about 4.7 million metric tons of LNG per year.
Negotiations continue to finalize the two remaining nonbinding Heads of
Agreement (HOAs) as binding SPAs, which would bring LNG delivery
commitments to a combined total of about 90 percent of Chevron s share of
LNG from the project.

     Through the end of 2010, the company has
signed nonbinding HOAs with three Asian customers for the delivery of about 80 percent of Chevron s net LNG offtake from the Chevron-operated Wheatstone Project. Negotiations continue to move the
three HOAs to binding SPAs with these customers. These three customers have also agreed to acquire
a combined 21.8 percent nonoperated working interest in the Wheatstone field licenses and a 17.5
percent interest in the foundation natural gas processing facilities at the time of the final
investment decision. The project, currently undergoing front-end engineering and design (FEED), has
a planned capacity of 8.9 million metric tons per year.

During 2010, the company announced additional deepwater natural gas discoveries, including the
Clio and Acme prospects in 67 percent-owned Block WA-205-P, Yellowglen prospect in 50
percent-owned Block WA-268-P, Brederode prospect in 50  percent-owned Block WA-364-P, 

and Sappho prospect in 50 percent-owned Block WA-392-P. In February 2011, the company announced a
natural gas discovery in the Orthrus prospect in 50 percent-owned Block WA-24-R. These discoveries
are expected to contribute to further growth at  company-operated LNG projects in Australia. 

Cambodia   The company completed three successful exploration wells during 2010. In the
first-half 2011, a 30-year production permit for the production sharing contract is expected to be
approved by the government. A final investment decision for construction of a wellhead platform and
a floating storage and offloading vessel is expected in 2011.

Canada   First production was achieved from the Jackpine Mine in third quarter 2010 as a result
of Athabasca Oil Sands Project Expansion 1 activities. In addition, through 2010 the company
acquired approximately 200,000 acres of shale gas leasehold in western Canada. The appraisal of
this acreage is expected to begin by the second-half 2011.

China   The company acquired a 100 percent interest in Blocks  53-30  and 64-18, and a 59 percent
interest in Block 42-05, covering a combined total exploratory acreage of approximately 5.2 million
acres in the South China Sea s Pearl River Mouth Basin.

Indonesia   A final investment decision was reached for Development Area 13 of the Duri Field,
where Chevron holds a 100 percent working interest.

The company awarded FEED contracts in December 2010 for the Gendalo-Gehem natural gas
development in the Makassar Strait offshore East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Contracts for floating
production units, subsea and flowline systems, export pipelines, and an onshore receiving facility
were awarded for the project.

Kazakhstan/Russia   Approval was obtained from the shareholders and governing bodies of the
Caspian Pipeline Consortium for a $5.4 billion expansion of the Caspian Pipeline. The capacity of

The company began purchases of its common stock in the fourth quarter, and as of December 31, 2010,
8.8 million common shares had been acquired under the program for $750 million.

Results of Operations 

Major Operating Areas   The following section presents the results of operations for the
company s business segments   Upstream and Downstream   as well as for  All Other.  Earnings are
also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream
business segments. (Refer to Note 11, beginning on page FS-41, for a discussion of the company s
 reportable segments,  as defined in accounting standards for segment reporting (Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 280)). This section should also be read in conjunction with the
discussion in  Business Environment and Outlook  on pages FS-2 through  FS-5. 

U.S. Upstream 

U.S. upstream earnings of $4.1 billion in 2010 increased $1.9 billion from 2009. Higher
prices for crude oil and natural gas increased earnings by $2.1 billion between periods. Partly
offsetting these effects were higher operating expenses of $200 million, in part due to the Gulf of
Mexico drilling moratorium. Lower exploration expenses were essentially offset by higher tax items
and higher depreciation expenses.

U.S. upstream earnings of $2.3 billion in 2009 decreased $4.9 billion from 2008. Lower prices
for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by about $5.2 billion between periods,

FS-7 

Table of Contents   

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

and gains on asset sales declined by approximately $900 million. Partially offsetting
these effects was a benefit of about $1.3 billion resulting from an increase in net oil equivalent
production. An approximate $600 million benefit to income from lower operating expenses was more
than offset by higher depreciation expense. The benefit from lower operating expenses was largely
associated with an absence of charges for damages related to the 2008 hurricanes in the Gulf of
Mexico.

The company s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2010 was
$71.59 per barrel, compared with $54.36 in 2009 and $88.43 in 2008. The average natural gas
realization was $4.26 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, compared with $3.73 and $7.90 in 2009 and
2008, respectively.

Net oil-equivalent production in 2010 averaged 708,000 barrels per day, down 1 percent from
2009 and up 6 percent from 2008. Natural field declines between 2010 and 2009 were mostly offset by
increased production from the Tahiti Field. The increase between 2009 and 2008 was mainly due to
the start-up of the Blind Faith Field in late 2008 and the Tahiti Field in second quarter 2009. The
net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2010 averaged 489,000 barrels per day, up 1
percent from 2009 and up 16 percent compared with 2008. Net natural gas production averaged 1.3
billion cubic feet per day in 2010, down approximately 6 percent from 2009 and down about 12
percent from 2008. Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table on page FS-11 for the three-year
comparative production volumes in the United States.

International Upstream 

Earnings of $13.6 billion in 2010 increased $4.9 billion from 2009. Higher prices for crude
oil and natural gas increased earnings by $4.3 billion, and an increase in net oil-equivalent
production in the 2010 period benefited income by about $1.2 billion. This net benefit was partly
offset by higher operating expenses of $500 million. A favorable change in tax items of about $450
million was mostly offset by higher depreciation expenses. The 2009 period included gains of about
$500 million on asset sales and tax items related to the Gorgon Project in Australia. Foreign
currency effects decreased earnings by $293 million in the 2010 period, compared with a reduction
of $578 million a year earlier, primarily reflecting noncash losses on balance sheet remeasurement.

International upstream earnings of $8.7 billion in 2009 decreased $6.4 billion from 2008.
Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by $7.0 billion, while foreign currency
effects and higher operating and depreciation expenses decreased income by a total of $2.2 billion.
Partially offsetting these items were benefits of $2.3 billion resulting from an increase in sales
volumes of crude oil and about $500 million associated with asset sales and tax items related to
the Gorgon Project.

The company s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2010
was $72.68 per barrel, compared with $55.97 in 2009 and $86.51 in 2008. The average natural gas
realization was $4.64 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, compared with $4.01 and $5.19 in 2009 and
2008, respectively.

International net oil-equivalent production of 2.06 million barrels per day in 2010 increased
about 3 percent and 11 percent from 2009 and 2008, respectively. The volumes in 2010 include
synthetic oil that was reported in 2009 and 2008 as production from oil sands in Canada. Absent the
impact of prices on certain production-sharing and variable-royalty agreements, net oil-equivalent
production increased 5 percent in 2010 and 4 percent in 2009, when compared with the prior year s
production.

The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.4 million barrels
per day in 2010, an increase of approximately 3 percent from 2009 and 14 percent from 2008.
International net natural gas production of 3.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2010 was up 4 percent
and 3 percent from 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table, on page FS-11, for the three-year comparative of
international production volumes.

U.S. Downstream 

U.S. downstream earned $1,339 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $121 million in
2009. Improved margins on refined products increased earnings by about $550 million. Also
contributing to the increase was a nearly $400 million gain on the sale of a 23.4 percent ownership
interest in the Colonial Pipeline Company. Higher earnings from chemicals operations increased
earnings by about $300 million, largely from improved margins at the 50 percent-owned Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).

Earnings decreased approximately $1.5 billion in 2009 from 2008. Lower refined product margins
resulted in an earnings decline of $1.7 billion. Partially offsetting the effects of lower refined
product margins was a decrease in operating expenses, which benefited earnings by $300 million, and
an increase of about $100 million in earnings from CPChem. The improvement for CPChem reflected
lower utility and manufacturing costs, as well as the absence of an impairment recorded in 2008.
These benefits more than offset lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals.

Sales volumes of refined products were 1.35 million barrels per day in 2010, a decrease of 4
percent from 2009. The decline was mainly in gasoline and jet fuel sales. Sales volumes of refined
products were 1.40 million barrels per day in 2009, a decrease of 1 percent from 2008. U.S. branded
gasoline sales decreased to 573,000 barrels per day in 2010, representing approximately 7 percent
and 5 percent declines from 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in 2010, relative to 2009 and
2008, was primarily due to the previously announced exits from selected eastern U.S. retail
markets.

Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table on page FS-11 for a three-year comparison
of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes.

International Downstream 

International downstream earned
$1,139 million in 2010, compared with $594
million in 2009. Higher margins on the
manufacture and sale of gasoline and other
refined products increased earnings by about
$1.0 billion, and a favorable swing in
mark-to-market effects on derivative
instruments benefited earnings by about $300
million. Partially offsetting these items was
the absence of 2009 gains on asset sales of
about $550
million and higher expenses of about $200 million, primarily related to employee reduction and

transportation costs. Foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $135 million in 2010, compared
with a reduction of $191 million in 2009. 
     Earnings of $594 million in 2009
decreased about $1.2 billion from 2008. A decline of
approximately $2.6 billion between periods was associated with weaker margins on the manufacture and
sale of gasoline and other refined products and the absence of gains recorded in 2008 on derivative
instruments. Foreign currency effects produced an unfavorable
variance of about $300 million. Partially
offsetting these items were a $1.0 billion benefit from
lower operating expenses associated mainly with contract labor, professional services and
transportation costs, and about a $550 million increase in gains on asset sales related to refined
products marketing operations, primarily in certain countries in Latin America and Africa.
      International refined product sales volumes of 1.76 million barrels per day in 2010 were 5
percent lower than in 2009, mainly due to asset sales in certain countries in Africa and Latin
America. Refined product sales volumes of 1.85 million barrels per day in 2009 were 8 percent lower
than in 2008, mainly due to the effects of asset sales and lower demand.
      Refer to the  Selected Operating Data  table, on page FS-11, for a three-year comparison of
sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes.

All Other includes mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash
management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations,
real estate activities, alternative fuels and technology companies.

Net charges in 2010 increased $209 million from 2009, mainly due to higher expenses for
employee compensation and benefits and higher corporate tax items, partly offset by lower
provisions for environmental remediation at sites that previously had been closed or sold. Net
charges in 2009 decreased $468 million from 2008 due to lower provisions for environmental
remediation at sites that previously had been closed or sold, favorable foreign currency effects
and lower expenses for employee compensation and benefits.

Consolidated Statement of Income 

Comparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below:

Sales and other operating revenues increased in 2010, mainly due to higher prices
for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Lower 2009 prices resulted in decreased
revenues compared with 2008.

Income from equity affiliates increased in 2010 from 2009 largely due to higher
upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil (TCO) in Kazakhstan and Petropiar in Venezuela,
principally related to higher prices for crude oil and increased crude oil production.
Downstream-related affiliate earnings were also higher between the comparative periods, primarily
due to higher earnings from CPChem, as a result of higher margins on sales of commodity chemicals.
Improved margins on refined products and a favorable swing in foreign currency effects at GS Caltex
in South Korea also contributed to the increase in downstream affiliate earnings in the 2010
period. Income from equity affiliates decreased in 2009 from 2008. Upstream-related affiliate
income declined about $1.3 billion mainly due to lower earnings for TCO as a result of lower prices
for crude oil. Downstream-related affiliate earnings were lower by approximately $1.0 billion
primarily due to weaker margins and an unfavorable swing in foreign

currency effects. Refer to Note 12, beginning on page FS-43, for a discussion of Chevron s
investments in affiliated companies.

Other income of $1.1 billion in 2010 included net gains of approximately $1.1 billion on asset
sales. Other income in both 2009 and 2008 included net gains from asset sales of $1.3 billion.
Interest income was approximately $120 million in 2010, $95 million in 2009 and $340 million in
2008. Foreign currency effects decreased other income by $251 million in 2010 and $466 million in
2009, while increasing other income by $355 million in 2008. In addition, other income in 2008
included approximately $700 million in favorable settlements and other items.

Crude oil and product purchases in 2010 increased $16.8 billion from 2009 due to higher
prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Crude oil and product purchases in 2009
decreased $71.7 billion from 2008 due to lower prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined
products.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 were about $1.6 billion
higher than 2009, primarily due to $600 million of higher fuel expenses; $500 million for employee
compensation and benefits; $200 million of increased construction, repair and maintenance expense;
and an increase of about $200 million associated with higher tanker charter rates. In addition,
charges of $234 million related to employee reductions were included in the 2010 period. Total
expenses for 2009 decreased approximately $4.2 billion from 2008 primarily due to $1.4 billion of
lower fuel and transportation expenses; $800 million of decreased costs for contract labor and
professional services; the absence of uninsured 2008 hurricane-related charges of $700 million; a
decrease of about $500 million for environmental remediation activities; $200 million of lower
costs for materials; and $600 million for other items. 

Exploration expenses in 2010 declined from 2009 mainly due to lower amounts for
geological and geophysical costs and well  write-offs.  Exploration expenses in 2009 

FS-10 

Table of Contents   

increased from 2008 mainly due to higher amounts for well  write-offs  in the United States and
international operations.

Effective income tax rates were 40 percent in 2010, 43 percent in 2009 and 44 percent in
2008. The rate was lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to international upstream impacts. A
lower effective tax rate in international upstream in 2010 was primarily driven by an increased
utilization of tax credits, which had a greater impact on the rate than one-time deferred tax
benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales in 2009. Also, a smaller portion of company
income was earned in higher tax rate international upstream jurisdictions in 2010 than in 2009.
Finally, foreign currency remeasurement impacts caused a reduction in the effective tax rate
between periods. The rate was lower in 2009 than in 2008 mainly due to the effect in 2009 of
deferred tax benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales, both related to an international
upstream project. In addition, a greater proportion of before-tax income was earned in 2009 by
equity affiliates than in 2008. (Equity affiliate income is reported as a single amount on an
after-tax basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income.) Partially offsetting these items was the
effect of a greater proportion of income earned in 2009 in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates.
Refer also to the discussion of income taxes in Note 15 beginning on page FS-47.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities   Total balances were $17.1
billion and $8.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash provided by operating
activities in 2010 was $31.4 billion, compared with $19.4 billion in 2009 and $29.6 billion in
2008. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
approximately $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion and $800 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.0
billion in 2010, $2.6 billion in 2009 and $1.5 billion in 2008. Cash provided by operating
activities during 2010 was more than sufficient to fund the company s $21.8 billion capital and
exploratory program, pay $5.7 billion of dividends to shareholders and repurchase $750 million of
common stock.

Restricted cash of $855 million and $123 million associated with various capital-investment
projects at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was invested in short-term marketable
securities and recorded as  Deferred charges and other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Dividends   Dividends paid to common stockholders were approximately $5.7 billion in 2010, $5.3
billion in 2009 and $5.2 billion in 2008. In April 2010, the company increased its quarterly common
stock dividend by 5.9 percent, to $0.72 per share.

Debt and capital lease obligations   Total debt and capital lease obligations were $11.5 billion
at December 31, 2010, up from $10.5 billion at year-end 2009.

The $1.0 billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2010 included
issuance of $1.25 billion of  tax-exempt  bonds, partially offset by a decrease in short-term
obligations. The company s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting
primarily of commercial paper, redeemable  long-term  obligations and the current portion of
 long-term  debt, totaled $5.6 billion at December 31, 2010, up from $4.6 billion at year-end 2009.
Of this amount, $5.4 billion and $4.2 billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each
period, respectively. At year-end 2010, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require
the use of working capital in 2011, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by
committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

At December 31, 2010, the company had $6.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various
major banks, expiring in May 2013, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a
long-term basis. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for
general corporate purposes. The company s practice has been to continually replace expiring
commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management
believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at
interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates
published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company s strong credit rating. No
borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2010. In addition, the company
has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in March 2013 for an unspecified amount
of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.

The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company s debt, and the company s cost
of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding
public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, Chevron Corporation Profit Sharing/Savings Plan Trust
Fund, Texaco Capital Inc. and Union Oil Company of California. All of these securities are the
obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard and Poor s
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody s Investors Service. The company s U.S. commercial paper is rated
 A-1   by Standard and
Poor s and P-1 by Moody s. All of these ratings denote high-quality,
investment-grade securities.

The company s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital
program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. Based on its high-quality debt
ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash
requirements. The company also can modify capital spending plans during periods of low prices for
crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures 

chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and
maintain the company s high-quality debt ratings.

Common stock repurchase program   In July 2010, the company terminated the $15 billion share
repurchase program initiated in September 2007. No share repurchases occurred in 2010 under the
program prior to its termination. From the inception of the program, the company acquired 119
million shares at a cost of $10.1 billion. In its place, the Board of Directors approved a new,
ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. The company expects to
repurchase between $500 million and $1 billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing
prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market
conditions and other factors. The company began purchases of its common stock in the fourth
quarter, and through December 31, 2010, 8.8 million shares were purchased under the new program for
$750 million.

Capital and exploratory expenditures   

Total expenditures for
2010 were $21.8 billion, including
$1.4 billion for the company s

share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2009 and 2008,

expenditures were $22.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively,
including the company s share of

affiliates  expenditures of
$1.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and $2 billion for the
extension of an upstream concession in 2009.

Of the $21.8 billion of expenditures in 2010, 87 percent, or $18.9 billion, was related to
upstream activities. Approximately 80 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2009 and 2008.
International upstream accounted for about 82 percent of the worldwide
upstream investment in 2010, about 80 percent in 2009 and about 70 percent
in 2008, reflecting the company s continuing focus on opportunities
available outside the United States.

      The company estimates that in 2011, capital and exploratory
expenditures will be $26.0 billion, including $2.0 billion of spending by
affiliates. Approximately 85 percent of the total, or $22.6 billion, is
budgeted for exploration and produc-

tion activities, with $17.2 billion of this amount for projects outside the United States. Spending
in 2011 is primarily focused on major development projects in Angola, Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, Nigeria, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Also included is funding
for base business improvements and focused exploration and appraisal programs in core hydrocarbon
basins.

Worldwide downstream spending in 2011 is estimated at $2.9 billion, with about $1.7 billion
for projects in the United States. Major capital outlays include projects under construction at
refineries in the United States and South Korea.

Investments in technology, power generation and other corporate businesses in 2011 are
budgeted at $500 million.

Noncontrolling interests   The company had noncontrolling interests of $730 million and $647
million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Distributions to noncontrolling interests
totaled $72 million and $71 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Pension Obligations   In 2010, the company s pension plan contributions were $1.4 billion
(including $1.19 billion to the U.S. plans and $258 million to the international plans). The
company estimates contributions in 2011 will be approximately $950 million ($650 million for the
U.S. plans and $300 million for the international plans). Actual contribution amounts are dependent
upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic
factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to
offset increases in plan obligations. Refer also to the discussion of pension accounting in
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions,  beginning on page FS-20.

Financial Ratios 

Financial Ratios 

Current
Ratio     current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the
company s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in
all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron s inventories are valued on a last-in,
first-out basis. At year-end 2010, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs,
based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $7.0 billion.

Interest
Coverage Ratio     income before income tax expense, plus interest and
debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company s
ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company s interest coverage ratio in 2010 was
higher than 2009 due to higher before-tax income. The company s interest coverage ratio in 2009
was lower than 2008 due to lower before-tax income.
 
       Debt
Ratio     total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders 
Equity, which indicates the company s leverage. The decrease between 2010 and 2009 was due to a
higher Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity balance. The increase in 2009 over 2008 was
primarily due to the increase in debt.

Guarantees, Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations, and Other Contingencies 

Direct Guarantee 

The company s guarantee of approximately $600 million is associated with certain
payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. The terminal is
expected to be operational by 2012. Over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum
guarantee amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are
numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of
any amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under
this guarantee.

Indemnifications   The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon
and Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company s interests in those investments. The

company would be required to perform if the indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Were that
to occur, the company could be required to make future payments up to $300 million. Through the end
of 2010, the company had paid $48 million under these indemnities and continues to be obligated for
possible additional indemnification payments in the future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the period of Texaco s ownership interest in the joint ventures. In general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
December 2001. Claims had to be asserted by February 2009 for Equilon indemnities and must be
asserted no later than February 2012 for Motiva indemnities. Under the terms of these indemnities,
there is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. The company posts no assets
as collateral and has made no payments under the indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by Equilon or
Motiva prior to September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those
assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200
million, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after
reaching the $200 million obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the
indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these
indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.

Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable
and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and
Take-or-Pay Agreements   The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput
and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers  financing arrangements. The
agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity,

FS-14 

Table of Contents   

drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the
company s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various
commitments are: 2011   $17.2 billion; 2012   $4.1 billion;  2013   $3.5 billion;  2014   $3.1
billion; 2015   $3.0 billion; 2016 and
 after   $7.7 billion.  A portion of these commitments may
ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately
$6.5 billion in 2010, $8.1 billion in 2009 and $5.1 billion in 2008.

The following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations:

     Excludes contributions for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans. Information
on employee benefit plans is contained in Note 21 beginning on page FS-52. 

2  
       
     Does not include amounts related to the company s income tax liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions. The company is unable to make reasonable estimates for the
periods in which these liabilities may become payable. The company does not expect
settlement of such liabilities will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity in any single period.

     $5.4 billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in long-term debt. The repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire
amounts in the 2012-2013 period. 

4  
       
     Does not include obligations to purchase the company s share of natural gas liquids and
regasified natural gas associated with operations of the 36.4 percent-owned Angola LNG
affiliate. The LNG plant is expected to commence operations in 2012 and is designed
to produce 5.2 million metric tons of LNG and related natural gas liquids per year. Volumes
and prices associated with these purchase obligations are neither fixed nor determinable. 

Financial and Derivative Instruments 

The market risk associated with the company s portfolio of financial and derivative
instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk discussed below
do not represent the company s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future
market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including
those set forth under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A, of the company s 2010 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Derivative Commodity Instruments   Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural

gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative
commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not
material to the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2010.

The company s market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company s risk management policies, which have
been approved by the Audit Committee of the company s Board of Directors.

The derivative commodity instruments used in the company s risk management and trading
activities consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. In addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap contracts and option
contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas
companies in the  over-the-counter  markets.

Virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other
independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron s derivative commodity
instruments in 2010 was a quarterly average decrease of $1 million in total assets and a quarterly
average increase of $18 million in total liabilities.

The company uses a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the potential loss in fair value on a
single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity
instruments held or issued, which are recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010, as
derivative commodity instruments in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives (ASC 815).
VaR is the maximum loss not to be exceeded within a given probability or confidence level over a
given period of time. The company s VaR model uses the Monte Carlo simulation method that involves
generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified probability distributions and constructing a
full distribution of a portfolio s potential values.

The VaR model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average for computing historical
volatilities and correlations, a 95 percent confidence level, and a one-day holding period. That
is, the company s 95 percent, one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value
that would not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were
held constant for one day.

The one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be
liquidated or hedged within one day. For hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most
of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. The
following table presents the 95
percent/one-day VaR for each of the company s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative
commodity instruments at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Foreign Currency   The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to
manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The
foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative
contracts at December 31, 2010.

Interest Rates   The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At
year-end 2010, the company had no interest rate swaps.

Transactions With Related Parties 

Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term
purchase agreements. Refer to Other Information in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, page FS-43, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been
negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

Litigation and Other Contingencies 

MTBE
  Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary
butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to 19 pending lawsuits and claims,
the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the
future. The company s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not
determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. The company no longer uses
MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States.

Ecuador  
Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the
Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to
be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations.
The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from
the oil exploration and

production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental
remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program.
Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member
of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian  state-owned  oil company, as the majority
partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion
of the consortium and following an independent  third-party  environmental audit of the concession
area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for
Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet s ownership
share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a  three-year  remediation
program at a cost of $40 million. After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government
granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental
liability arising from the consortium operations.

Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously
given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and
municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms
that Texpet s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage
reflects Petroecuador s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuador s
further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.

In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $18.9 billion, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
Petroecuador. The engineer s report also asserted that an
additional $8.4 billion could be assessed
against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence
that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves
out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the
case was recused. In 2010, Chevron
moved to strike the mining engineer s report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States
indicating that the report was prepared by con-

FS-16 

Table of Contents   

sultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as
the mining engineer s independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct.
In August 2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer s
report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days. Chevron
subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of
fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory
time requirement.

In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should
be assessed against it. The plaintiffs  submission, which relied in part on the mining engineer s
report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16
billion and $76 billion and that
unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between
approximately $5 billion and $38 billion. The
next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the
parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned
to have that order declared a nullity in light of Chevron s prior recusal petition, and because
procedural and evidentiary matters remain unresolved. In October 2010, Chevron s motion to recuse
the judge was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge s order
closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing
the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so
that he could prepare a judgment.

Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of
Ecuador before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of
Ecuador s obligations under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and
breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet
(described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration,
Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that
any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuador s
obligations under the BIT. On February 9, 2011, the Permanent Court of Arbitration issued an Order
for Interim Measures requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all
measures at its disposal to
suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any
judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. Chevron
expects to continue seeking permanent injunctive relief and monetary
relief before the Tribunal.

Through a series of recent U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery
relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron has obtained evidence that
it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of

several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011,
Chevron filed a civil law-

suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York
against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through
the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration
that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other
unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. On February 8, 2011, the Court issued a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them
from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against Chevron
in the Lago Agrio case until March 8, 2011.
Chevron s motion for a preliminary injunction is presently before the Court.

On February 14, 2011, the Provincial Court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the
case. The Provincial Court rejected Chevron s defenses to the extent the Court addressed them in
its opinion. The judgment assesses approximately $8.6 billion in damages and about $0.9 billion
for the plaintiffs  representatives. It also assesses an additional amount of approximately $8.6
billion in punitive damages unless the company provides a public apology. Chevron continues to
believe the Court s judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and
other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to
the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron will appeal this decision in Ecuador. Chevron cannot
predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador. Chevron will continue
a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability. Because Chevron has no substantial assets in
Ecuador, Chevron would expect enforcement actions as a result of this judgment to be brought in
other jurisdictions. Chevron  expects to contest any such actions.

The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron,
remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a
range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the judgment, the
2008 engineer s report and the September 2010 plaintiffs  submission, management does not believe
these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).
Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for
management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

Environmental   The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations,
private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal
settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate
the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including
MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including,
but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude
oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and
mining operations, whether operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable
due to such factors as the unknown 

FS-17 

Table of Contents   

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and
extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company s
liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are
recoverable from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the company s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

The following table displays the annual changes to the company s before-tax environmental
remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state
laws.

Included in the $1,507 million year-end 2010 reserve balance were remediation activities
at approximately 182 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible
party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or
other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state
laws. The company s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2010 was $185 million. The
federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron
to assume other potentially responsible parties  costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not

expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.

Of the remaining year-end 2010 environmental reserves balance of $1,322 million, $814 million
related to the company s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants,
marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. The
remaining $508 million was associated with various sites in international downstream ($100
million), upstream ($329 million) and other businesses ($79 million). Liabilities at all sites,
whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the company s plans and
activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. These and other activities
include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of
contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and
vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of
the contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state or
local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2010 had a recorded liability that was
material to the company s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.

The company records asset obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset
retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of
approximately $12.5 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2010 related primarily to
upstream properties.

For the company s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals
facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets
reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has
been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of
the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

Refer also to Note 25 on page FS-62, related to the company s asset retirement
obligations and the discussion of  Environmental Matters  on page FS-19.

Table of Contents   

Income Taxes   The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. Refer to Note 15 beginning on page  FS-47  for a discussion of the periods for which tax
returns have been audited for the company s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax
jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The company does not
expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Suspended Wells   The company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude oil and natural gas fields. The
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity or
development decisions or both. At December 31, 2010, the company had approximately $2.7 billion of
suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $283
million from 2009. The 2009 balance reflected an increase of $317 million from 2008.

The future trend of the company s exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. The effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $2.7 billion of suspended wells at year-end 2010 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.

Refer to Note 19, beginning on page FS-50, for additional discussion of suspended wells.

Equity Redetermination   For crude oil and natural gas producing operations, ownership
agreements may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and
natural gas reserves. These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses
that could be material to earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination process has
been under way since 1996 for Chevron s interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum
Reserve at Elk Hills, California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were
owned by the U.S. Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount
for the four zones. For this range of settlement, Chevron estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200 million, and the possible maximum net amount that could
be owed to Chevron is estimated at about $150 million. The timing of the settlement and the exact
amount within this range of estimates are uncertain.

Other Contingencies   On April 26, 2010, a California appeals court issued a ruling related to
the adequacy of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) supporting the issuance of certain permits by the city of
Richmond, California, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at Chevron s refinery in

Richmond.
Settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and the company
continues to evaluate its options going forward, which may include requesting the city to revise
the EIR to address the issues identified by the Court of Appeal or
other actions. Management believes the outcomes associated with the potential options for the project are uncertain. Due to
the uncertainty of the company s future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or
combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any,
of the ruling can be made at this time. However, the company s ultimate exposure may be
significant to net income in any one future period.

Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; U.S. federal,
state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. The amounts
of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to
resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.

Environmental Matters 

Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.

Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at  third-party-owned  waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at  non-Chevron  sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards.

Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2010 at
approximately $2.9 billion for its
consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were
approximately $1.4 billion of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and
restoration of sites.

For 2011, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.5 billion.
These capital costs are

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental
regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by
prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of
operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the
company s liquidity or financial position.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 

Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company s consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over
different reporting periods. All such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Estimates and assumptions are based on management s experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.

The discussion in this section of  critical  accounting estimates and assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:

1. 
       
     the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and 

2. 
       
     the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the
company s financial condition or operating performance is material. 

Besides those meeting these  critical  criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. Although
not associated with  highly uncertain matters,  these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.

For example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be  more likely than not.  Another
example is the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves under SEC rules, which require  ...by 

analysis of geosciences and engineering data, (the reserves) can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible...under existing economic conditions  where existing
economic conditions include prices based on the average price during the 12-month period prior to
the end of  the reporting period. Refer to Table V,  Reserve Quantity Information,  beginning on
page FS-71, for the changes in these estimates for the three years ending December 31, 2010, and to
Table VII,  Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved
Reserves  on page FS-80 for estimates of proved-reserve values for each of the three years ended
December 31, 2010. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-32,
includes a description of the  successful efforts  method of accounting for oil and gas exploration
and production activities. The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the
timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.

The discussion of the critical accounting policy for  Impairment of Properties, Plant and
Equipment and Investments in Affiliates,  beginning on page FS-22, includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and
gas properties. This commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. Significant accounting policies are
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-32. The
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
 critical,  and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

The areas of accounting and the associated  critical  estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans   The determination of pension plan obligations
and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. For other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, which provide for certain health care
and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining OPEB obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed
health care  cost-trend rates. 

Note 21, beginning on page FS-52, includes information on the funded status of the company s
pension and OPEB plans at the end of 2010 and 2009; the components of pension and OPEB expense for
the three years ending December 31, 2010; and the underlying assumptions for those periods.

FS-20 

Table of Contents   

Pension and OPEB expense is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as  Operating
expenses  or  Selling, general and administrative expenses  and applies to all business segments.
The year-end 2010 and 2009 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and
obligations, of each of the company s pension and OPEB plans is recognized on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a long-term
asset in  Deferred charges and other assets.  The differences associated with underfunded or
unfunded pension and OPEB plans are reported as  Accrued liabilities  or  Reserves for employee
benefit plans.  Amounts yet to be recognized as components of pension or OPEB expense are reported
in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

To estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses a process that
incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future performance
and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. Asset allocations
are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the
company s estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. The expected
long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 70 percent of the company s pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8 percent since 2002. For the 10 years ending December 31,
2010, actual asset returns averaged 4.7 percent for this plan. The actual return for 2010 was 11.6
percent and was associated with the broad recovery in the financial markets.

The year-end market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting rules. Management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market
value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine U.S. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality  fixed-income  debt instruments. At December 31, 2010, the company selected a 4.8
percent discount rate for the major U.S. pension plan and 5.0 percent for its OPEB plan. These
rates were selected based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the Citigroup Pension Discount Yield Curve as of  year-end  2010. The discount rates at the end of
2009 were 5.3 percent for the major U.S. pension plan and 5.8 percent for the company s U.S. OPEB
plan, and 6.3 percent at the end of 2008 for both the U.S. pension and OPEB plans.

An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. Total pension expense for 2010 was $1.1 billion. As an
indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1
percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the 

company s primary U.S. pension
plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2010 by approximately $65 million. A 1
percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for about 61 percent of
the  companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2010 by
approximately $140 million.

An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the
funded status of a plan reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total pension liability on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010, for underfunded plans was approximately $3.3
billion. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company s primary U.S.
pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $300 million, which would have
decreased the plan s underfunded status from approximately $0.9 billion to $0.6 billion. Other
plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. The actual rates of return on plan
assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in
the world s financial markets.

In 2010, the company s pension plan contributions were $1.45 billion (including $1.19 billion
to the U.S. plans). In 2011, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $950
million. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. Additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

For the company s OPEB plans, expense for 2010 was $166 million and the total liability,
which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2010, was $3.6 billion.

As an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of OPEB expense in 2010, a
1 percent increase in the discount rate for the company s primary U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted
for about 69 percent of the companywide OPEB expense, would have decreased OPEB expense by
approximately $15 million. A 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 85 percent of the companywide OPEB liabilities, would have decreased total OPEB
liabilities at the end of 2010 by approximately $80 million.

For the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4 percent per year. For active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims
experiences are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 8
percent in 2011 and gradually drop to 5 percent for 2018 and beyond. As an indication of the health
care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of OPEB expense in 2010, a 1 percent increase
in the rates for the main U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted for 85 percent of the companywide OPEB liabilities, would have increased OPEB
expense by $8 million.

Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of
each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference
occurs. Instead, the differences are

included in actuarial gain/loss and unamortized amounts have
been reflected in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer
to Note 21, beginning on page FS-52, for information on the $6.7 billion of before-tax actuarial
losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2010; a description of the method used to
amortize those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2011.

Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates   The company
assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP E) for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Such indicators include changes in the company s business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved
reserve quantities. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the
asset over its estimated fair value.

Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the company s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the
discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 9 beginning on page FS-37.

No major individual impairments of PP E and Investments were recorded for the three years
ending December 31, 2010. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if
other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not
practicable, given the broad range of the company s PP E and the number of assumptions involved in
the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair
any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown
number of other assets to become impaired.

Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method,
as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees,
are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company s carrying
value. When such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded
to the income statement for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its
estimated fair value at the time.

In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company
considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee s financial
performance, and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that
will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value.
Differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of
the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.

From time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when
significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field
or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified
as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets  associated carrying values.

Goodwill   Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. As
required by accounting standards for goodwill (ASC 350), the company tests such goodwill at the
reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.

Contingent Losses   Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation,
the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and
improvements in technology.

Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies
if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports
these losses as  Operating expenses  or  Selling, general and administrative expenses  on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to

FS-22 

Table of Contents   

this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is  more likely than
not  (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For
additional  discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 15 beginning on page FS-47. Refer
also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three
years ended December 31, 2010.

An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

New Accounting Standards 

Transfers and Servicing (ASC 860), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009-16)  
The FASB issued ASU 2009-16 in December 2009. This standard became effective for the company on
January 1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 changes how companies account for transfers of financial assets and
eliminates the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities. Adoption of the guidance did not
have an effect on the company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Consolidation (ASC 810), Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved With
Variable Interest Entities  (ASU
2009-17)    The FASB issued ASU 2009-17 in December 2009. This standard
became effective for the company January 1, 2010. ASU 2009-17 requires the enterprise to
qualitatively assess if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable-interest entity (VIE), and if
so, the VIE must be consolidated. Adoption of the standard did not have an impact on the company s
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Receivables (ASC 310), Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the
Allowance for Credit Losses  (ASU
2010-20)    In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20, which became
effective with the company s reporting at December 31, 2010. This standard amends and expands
disclosure requirements about the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance
for credit losses. As a result of these amendments, companies are required to disaggregate, by
portfolio segment or class of financing receivable, certain existing disclosures and provide
certain new disclosures about financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses.
Adoption of the standard did not change the company s existing disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation: 

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating 

the overall
financial statement  presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General   Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil
and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural
gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing,
transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream
operations relate primarily to refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil
and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor
equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and additives for fuels and lubricant oils.

The company s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.

The nature of the company s operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. The company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.

Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies   The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and variable-interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to
50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the company s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate s equity
currently in income.

Investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of
the investment may be below the company s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a
decline is other

than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the
investee s financial performance, and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment
for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s
market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for
subsequent recoveries in fair value.

Differences between the company s carrying value of an equity
investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent
practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company s analysis of the various
factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company s share of the affiliate s
reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values
and the affiliate s historical book values.

Derivatives   The majority of the company s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. For the company s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative
instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from
time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest
rate swaps related to a portion of the company s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as
fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair
value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a
party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for
derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance
sheet.

Short-Term Investments   All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company s cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as  Cash equivalents. 
Bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as  Time deposits.  The
balance of short-term investments is reported as  Marketable securities  and is marked-to-market,
with any unrealized gains or losses included in  Other comprehensive income. 

Inventories   Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost,
using a last-in, first-out

FS-32  

Table of Contents   

Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

(LIFO) method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market.  Materials, supplies and other 
inventories generally are stated at average cost.

Properties, Plant and Equipment   The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have
found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when
the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 19, beginning on page FS-50, for additional
discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties,
are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the United States, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are generally
done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing area or marketing assets by country.
Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental  Depreciation, depletion and amortization  expense.

Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value. Refer to Note 9, beginning on page FS-37, relating to fair value measurements.

As required under accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) 410), the fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a
liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 25, on page FS-62, relating to AROs.

Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas
producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method
generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses
for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production
method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation
provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.

Depreciation and depletion expenses for mining assets are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. The capitalized costs of all other
plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the
straight-line method generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.

Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as  Other income. 

Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs
and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as
incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.

Goodwill   Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. As required
by accounting standards for goodwill (ASC 350), the company tests such goodwill at the reporting
unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.

Environmental Expenditures   Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.

Liabilities related to future remediation
costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs
can be reasonably estimated. For the company s U.S. and Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual

FS-33  

Table of Contents   

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
           Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. For
crude oil, natural gas and  mineral-producing  properties, a liability for an ARO is made, following
accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 25, on page
FS-62, for a discussion of the company s AROs.

For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a
liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for
other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other
parties are not able to pay their respective shares.

The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company s best estimate of
future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
company s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.

Currency Translation   The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
company s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all
gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in  Currency translation adjustment  on the
Consolidated Statement of Equity.

Revenue Recognition   Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on the
entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The
associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income on page FS-27.
Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation
of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and
reported in  Purchased crude oil and products  on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Stock
Options and Other Share-Based Compensation   The company issues stock options and other
share-based compensation to its employees and accounts for these transactions under the accounting
standards for share-based compensation (ASC 718). For equity awards, such as stock options, total
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock
appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn
the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes
eligible to retain the award at retirement. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted
under the company s Long-Term Incentive Plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of
each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The company
amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.

Agreement to Acquire Atlas Energy, Inc.

In November 2010, Chevron announced plans to acquire Atlas Energy, Inc. The acquisition was
completed in February 2011 for $4,470, including assumed debt. The acquisition will be accounted
for as a business combination (ASC 805). Atlas holds one of the premier acreage positions in the
Marcellus Shale, concentrated in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Noncontrolling Interests

The company adopted accounting standards for noncontrolling interests (ASC 810) in the
consolidated financial statements effective January 1, 2009, and retroactive to the earliest period
presented. Ownership interests in the company s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
are presented separately from the parent s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both
presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The term  earnings  is defined as
 Net Income Attributable to Chevron Corporation. 

Activity for the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as

Information Relating to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

In accordance with accounting standards for cash-flow classifications for stock options (ASC 718),
the  Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital  includes reductions of $67, $25 and $106
for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. These amounts are offset by an equal amount in  Net (purchases) sales of treasury
shares. 

The  Net (purchases) sales of treasury shares  represents the cost of common shares purchased
less the cost of shares issued for  share-based  compensation plans. Purchases totaled $775, $6 and
$8,011 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Purchases in 2010 and 2008 included shares purchased
under the company s common stock repurchase programs.

In 2010,  Net (purchases) sales of other short-term investments  consist of restricted cash
associated with capital-investment projects at the company s Pascagoula and El Segundo refineries
and the Angola liquefied natural gas project that was invested in short-term securities and
reclassified from

Cash and cash equivalents  to  Deferred charges and other assets  on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company issued $1,250 and $350, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, of
tax exempt bonds as a source of funds for U.S. refinery projects.

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet
that did not affect cash. In 2008,  Net (purchases) sales of treasury shares  excludes $680 of
treasury shares acquired in exchange for a U.S. upstream property and $280 in cash. The carrying
value of this property in  Properties, plant and equipment  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was
not significant. In 2008, a $2,450 increase in  Accrued liabilities  and a corresponding increase
to  Properties, plant and equipment, at cost  were considered noncash transactions and excluded
from  Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital  and  Capital expenditures.  In 2009,
the payments related to these  Accrued liabilities  were excluded from  Net decrease (increase) in
operating working capital  and were reported as  Capital expenditures.  The amount is related to
upstream operating agreements outside the United States.  Capital expenditures  in 2008 excludes a
$1,400 increase in  Properties, plant and equipment  related to the acquisition of an additional
interest in an equity affiliate that required a change to the consolidated method of accounting for
the investment during 2008. This addition was offset primarily by reductions in  Investments and
advances  and working capital and an increase in  Non-current deferred income tax  liabilities.
Refer also to Note 25, on page FS-62, for a discussion of revisions to the company s AROs that also
did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31, 2010.

The major components of  Capital expenditures  and the reconciliation of this amount to the
reported capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates, are presented in the
following table:

Lease Commitments

Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included
as part of  Properties, plant and equipment, at cost  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such
leasing arrangements involve tanker charters, crude oil production and processing equipment,
service stations, office buildings, and other facilities. Other leases are classified as operating
leases and are not capitalized. The payments on such leases are recorded as expense. Details of the
capitalized leased assets are as follows:

Rental expenses incurred for operating leases during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Contingent rentals are based on factors other than the passage of time, principally sales
volumes at leased service stations. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rentals
to reflect changes in price indices, renewal options ranging up to 25 years, and options to
purchase the leased property during or at the end of the initial or renewal lease period for the
fair market value or other specified amount at that time.

At December 31, 2010, the estimated future minimum lease payments (net of noncancelable
sublease rentals) under operating and capital leases, which at inception had a noncancelable term
of more than one year, were as follows:

Note 9 

Fair Value Measurements

Accounting standards for
fair value measurement (ASC 820) establish a framework for measuring fair
value and stipulate disclosures about fair value measurements. The standards apply to recurring and
nonrecurring financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that require or permit fair value
measurements. Among the required disclosures is the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses
to value an asset or a liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as
follows:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For
the company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are
willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively
traded.

Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the
company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained
through third-party broker quotes, and prices that can be corroborated with other observable
inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring
fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value
associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. In
2010, the company used Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of certain nonrecurring
nonfinancial assets.

Note 9   Fair Value Measurements - Continued    

The fair value hierarchy for recurring assets and liabilities measured at fair value at
December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, is as follows:

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

Marketable
Securities   The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based
on quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. The fair values reflect the cash that
would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2010.

Derivatives   The
 company records its derivative instruments   other than any commodity derivative
contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale   on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at fair value, with virtually all the offsetting amount on the Consolidated Statement of
Income. For derivatives with identical or similar provisions as contracts that are publicly traded
on a regular basis, the company uses the market values of the publicly traded instruments as an
input for fair value calculations.

The company s derivative instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined
product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include
futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile
Exchange.

Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts principally
with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values for which are obtained
from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains
multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information
is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does
not materially adjust this information. The company incorporates internal review, evaluation and
assessment procedures, including a comparison of Level 2 fair values derived from the company s
internally developed for-

ward curves (on a sample basis) with the pricing
information to document reasonable, logical and
supportable fair value determinations and proper level of classification.

Impairments of  Properties,
 plant and equipment    In accordance with the accounting standard for the
impairment or disposal of
 long-lived  assets (ASC 360), during 2010
and 2009  long-lived   assets  held
and used  with carrying amounts of $142 and $949 were written down to fair values of $57 and $490
resulting in   before-tax  losses of $85 and $459, respectively. The fair values were determined from
internal cash flow models, using discount rates consistent with those used by the company to
evaluate cash flows of other assets of a similar nature.

Long-lived assets  held for sale  with carrying amounts of $49 and $160 were written down to a
fair value of $13 and $68, resulting in a before-tax loss of $36 and $92 in 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The fair values were determined based on bids received from prospective buyers and
from internal cash-flow models consistent with those used by the company to evaluate cash flows of
other assets of a similar nature.

Impairments of  Investments and advances    In accordance with the accounting standards under the
equity method of accounting (ASC 323) and the cost method of accounting (ASC 325), during 2010 and
2009 investments with carrying amounts of $15 and $81 were written down to fair values of $0 and
$39 resulting in before-tax losses of $15 and $42, respectively. The fair values were determined
using discount rates consistent with those used by the company to evaluate cash flows of other
investments of a similar nature.

Fair Value Measurements - Continued

The fair value hierarchy for nonrecurring assets and liabilities measured at fair value during
2010 is presented in the following table:

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a
Nonrecurring Basis 

Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value   The company holds cash
equivalents and bank time deposits in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as
cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less and money
market funds.  Cash and cash equivalents  had carrying/fair values of $14,060 and $8,716 at
December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The instruments held in  Time deposits  are
bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days and had carrying/fair values of $2,855 at
December 31, 2010. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits reflect the cash
that would have been received or paid if the instruments were settled at year-end.

Cash and cash equivalents  do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $855 and
$123 at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. These investments are restricted
funds related to an international upstream development project and U.S. refinery projects, which
are reported in  Deferred charges and other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term
debt of $5,636 and $5,705 had estimated fair values of $6,311 and $6,229 at December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, respectively.

The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
approximate their fair values. Fair values of other financial instruments at the end of 2010 and
2009 were not material.

Note 10 

Financial and Derivative Instruments

Derivative Commodity Instruments   Chevron is exposed to market
risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids,
liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company
refineries. From time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited
trading purposes.

The company s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and
refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company s derivative
instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company s affiliates
make such designation. The company s derivatives are not material to the company s financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or
credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity
derivative activities.

The company uses International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements to govern
derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. Depending on the nature
of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. When the
company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty
and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market
exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and
is a reasonable measure of the company s credit risk exposure. The company also uses other netting
agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate
credit risk.

Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2010,  December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, and
their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as
follows:

Consolidated Statement of Income: 
The Effect of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 

Foreign Currency   The company may enter into currency derivative contracts to manage some of its
foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions,
including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The currency derivative
contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. There were no open currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Interest Rates   The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a

portion of the company s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges.
Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2010 and 2009, the
company had no interest rate swaps.

Concentrations of Credit Risk   The company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The
company s  short-term  investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. These investment
policies limit the company s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk.
Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company s
counterparties in derivative instruments.

The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company s diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the company s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes
concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring
Letters of Credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.

Operating Segments and Geographic Data

Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its
own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their
affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream,
representing the company s  reportable segments  and  operating segments  as defined in accounting
standards for segment reporting (ASC 280). Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification
associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil
export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a
gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into
petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and
refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and
marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant
additives. All Other activities of the company include mining operations, power generation
businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative
functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, and alternative fuels and
technology.

The segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
 segment managers  who report to the company s  chief operating decision maker  (CODM) (terms as
defined in ASC 280). The CODM is the company s Executive Committee (EXCOM), a committee of senior
officers that includes the Chief Executive Officer, and EXCOM reports to the Board of Directors of
Chevron Corporation.

The operating segments represent components of the company, as described in accounting
standards for segment reporting (ASC 280), that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are
earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM,
which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their
performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.

Segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the company s CODM to discuss the segment s operating activities and financial
performance. The CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and

exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers within the operating segments are directly
responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and all other matters connected with
daily operations. Company officers who are members of the EXCOM also have individual management
responsibilities and participate in other committees for purposes other than acting as the CODM.

The
activities reported in Chevron s upstream and downstream operating segments have changed effective January 1, 2010. Chemicals businesses are now reported as part of the downstream segment.
In addition, the company s significant upstream-enabling operations, primarily a gas-to-liquids
project and major international export pipelines, have been reclassified from the downstream
segment to the upstream segment. Prior period information in this report has been revised to
conform to the 2010 presentation.

The company s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of
domicile. Other components of the company s operations are reported as  International  (outside
the United States).

Segment Earnings   The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in
 All Other.  Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:

Segment Assets   Segment
 assets do not include intercompany investments or intercompany
receivables. Segment assets at
 year-end  2010 and 2009 are as follows:

* All Other  assets consist primarily of worldwide cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and
marketable securities, real estate, energy services, information systems, mining operations, power
generation businesses, alternative fuels and technology companies, and assets of the corporate
administrative functions. 

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues   Operating segment sales and other operating revenues,
including internal transfers, for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, are presented in the table at
the right. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that
approximate market prices.

Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude
oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the
downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as
gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude
oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of additives for fuels and
lubricant oils and the transportation and trading of refined products, crude oil and natural gas
liquids.  All Other  activities include revenues from mining operations, power generation
businesses, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10 percent or more of the
company s total sales and other operating revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Other Segment Information   Additional
information for the segmentation of major
equity affiliates is contained in Note 12,

Investments and Advances

Equity in earnings, together with investments in and advances to companies accounted for using the
equity method and other investments accounted for at or below cost, is shown in the following
table. For certain equity affiliates, Chevron pays its share of some income taxes directly. For
such affiliates, the equity in earnings does not include these taxes, which are reported on the
Consolidated Statement of Income as  Income tax expense. 

Descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the company s
carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates,
are as follows:

Tengizchevroil   Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), a joint
venture formed in 1993 to develop the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan over a
 40-year  period. At December 31, 2010, the company s carrying value of its investment in TCO was
about

$190 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO s net assets. This difference results from
Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book
value for that portion of TCO s net assets. See Note 7, on page FS-36, for summarized financial
information for 100 percent of TCO.

Petropiar   Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company formed in 2008 to
operate the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. The project, located in Venezuela s
Orinoco Belt, has a 25-year contract term. Prior to the formation of Petropiar, Chevron had a 30
percent interest in the Hamaca project. At December 31, 2010, the company s carrying value of its
investment in Petropiar was approximately $190 less than the amount of underlying equity in
Petropiar s net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevron s underlying equity in
Petropiar s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.

Caspian Pipeline Consortium   Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a
variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and
Karachaganak. The company joined the consortium in 1997 and has investments and advances totaling
$974 which includes long term loans of $1,046 at year-end 2010. The loans were provided to fund 30
percent of the pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium
because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share
of the financial returns.

Petroboscan   Chevron has a 39 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006
to operate the Boscan Field in Venezuela until 2026. Chevron previously operated the field under an
operating service agreement. At December 31, 2010, the company s carrying value of its investment
in Petroboscan was approximately $250 higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan s
net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by
Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan s net assets.

Angola LNG Ltd.   Chevron has a 36 percent interest in Angola LNG Ltd., which will process and
liquefy natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.

Litigation

MTBE   Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to 19 pending lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury
claims, may be filed in the future.
The company s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable, but
could be material to net income in any one period. The company no longer uses MTBE in the
manufacture of gasoline in the United States.

Ecuador  
 Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the
Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to
be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had
operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production
operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the
alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of
Texaco Inc., was a minority
member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the
majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been con-

ducted solely by Petroecuador. At the
conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the
concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and
Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to
Texpet s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a
three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. After certifying that the sites were properly
remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from
any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations.

Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously
given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and
municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms
that Texpet s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador s
failure to timely fulfill its
legal obligations and Petroecuador s further conduct since assuming full control over the
operations.

In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a

FS-45

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

report recommending
that the court assess $18,900, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
Petroecuador. The engineer s report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be assessed
against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence
that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves
out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the
case was recused. In 2010, Chevron moved to strike the mining engineer s report and to dismiss the
case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States indicating that the report
was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineer s
independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the
judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer s report and requiring
the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days. Chevron subsequently petitioned
for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and
that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement.

In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should
be assessed against it. The plaintiffs  submission, which relied in part on the mining engineer s
report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and that
unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000. The next
day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties
that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned to have
that order declared a nullity in light of Chevron s prior recusal petition, and because procedural
and evidentiary matters remain unresolved. In October 2010, Chevron s motion to recuse the judge
was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge s order closing the
evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the
evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that
he could prepare a judgment.  
     Chevron
and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador
before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuador s
obligations under
the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and
release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are
investment agreements protected

by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking
relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron
in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuador s obligations under the BIT. On
February 9, 2011, the Permanent Court of Arbitration issued an Order for Interim Measures requiring
the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended
the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the
Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. Chevron expects to continue seeking
permanent injunctive relief and monetary relief before the Tribunal.

Through a series of recent U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery
relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron has obtained evidence that
it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of
several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011,
Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York
against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
and other state laws. Through
the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration
that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other
unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. On February 8, 2011, the Court issued a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them
from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against Chevron
in the Lago Agrio case until March 8, 2011. Chevron s motion for a preliminary injunction is presently before the Court.

On February 14, 2011, the Provincial Court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case.
The Provincial Court rejected Chevron s defenses to the extent the Court addressed them in its
opinion. The judgment assesses approximately $8,600 in damages and about $900 for the plaintiffs 
representatives. It also assesses an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages
unless the company provides a public apology. Chevron continues to believe the Court s judgment is
illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also
believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence.
Chevron will appeal this decision in Ecuador. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate
outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador. Chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any
imposition of liability. Because Chevron has no substantial assets in Ecuador, Chevron would
expect enforcement actions  as a result of this judgment to be brought in other jurisdictions.
Chevron  expects to contest any such actions.

The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron,
remains uncertain.

Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a
range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects
associated with the judgment, the 2008
engineer s report and the September 2010 plaintiffs  submission, management does not believe these
documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).
Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for
management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

Taxes

Income Taxes 

In 2010, before-tax income for U.S. operations, including related corporate and other charges, was
$6,528, compared with before-tax income of $1,310 and $10,765 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. For
international operations, before-tax income was $25,527, $17,218 and $32,292 in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively. U.S. federal income tax expense was reduced by $162, $204 and $198 in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively, for business tax credits.

The reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company s
effective income tax rate is explained in the following table:

The company s effective tax rate decreased from 43.0 percent in 2009 to 40.3 percent in 2010.
The rate was lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to international upstream impacts. A lower
effective tax rate in international upstream in 2010 was primarily driven by an increased
utilization of tax credits, which had a greater impact on the rate than one-time deferred tax
benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales in 2009. Also, a smaller portion of company
income was earned in higher tax rate international upstream jurisdictions in 2010 than in 2009.
Finally, foreign currency remeasurement impacts caused a reduction in the effective tax rate
between periods.

The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net
amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or
liabilities. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:

Deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2010 increased by almost $1,400 from year-end 2009. The
increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and
equipment.

Deferred tax assets increased by approximately $700 in 2010. Increases primarily related to
additional foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions (which were
substantially offset by valuation allowances) and to increased temporary differences for asset
retirement obligations, environmental reserves and employee benefits. These effects were partially
offset by reductions in deferred credits resulting primarily from the usage of tax benefits in
international tax jurisdictions.

The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit
carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets
to amounts that are, in management s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. Tax loss
carryforwards

FS-47

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

exist in many international jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss
carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2011 through
2036. Foreign tax credit carryforwards of $6,669 will expire between 2011 and 2020.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as follows:

Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have
been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international
consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made
for possible future remittances totaled $21,347 at December 31, 2010. This amount represents
earnings reinvested as part of the company s ongoing international business. It is not practicable
to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of earnings that
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. At the end of 2010, deferred income taxes were recorded
for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations for which the company no longer
intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings. The company does not anticipate incurring significant
additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

Uncertain Income Tax Positions   Under accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes (ASC
740-10), a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if management s assessment is that the position is  more likely than not  (i.e., a
likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the
technical merits of the position. The term  tax position  in the accounting standards for income
taxes
(ASC
740-10-20) refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be
taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets
and liabilities for interim or annual periods.

The following table indicates the changes to the company s unrecognized tax benefits for the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The term  unrecognized tax benefits  in the
accounting standards for income taxes (ASC 740-10-20) refers to the differences between a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in
the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.

Approximately 80 percent of the $3,507 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010,
would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these
unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance
at the time of any such recognition.

Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits
by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company s major tax jurisdictions,
examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31,
2010. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been
finalized were as follows: United States   2005, Nigeria  
1994, Angola   2001 and Saudi Arabia
  2003.

The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax
matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of
resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably
possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant
increases or decreases in the company s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being
examined in the various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax
benefits.

On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to
liabilities for uncertain tax positions as  Income tax expense.  As of December 31, 2010, accruals
of $225 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, compared with accruals of $232 as of year-end 2009. Income tax expense (benefit) associated
with interest and penalties was $40, $(20) and $79 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Short-Term Debt

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of  tax-exempt  variable-rate put bonds that are
included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders
within one year following the balance sheet date.

In 2010, $1,250 of tax-exempt bonds related to projects at the Pascagoula and El Segundo refineries
were issued.

The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt.
At December 31, 2010, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.

At December 31, 2010, the company had $6,000 in committed credit facilities with various major
banks, expiring in May 2013, that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term
basis. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general
corporate 

purposes. The company s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with
new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes
appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by
specified banks and on terms reflecting the company s strong credit rating. No borrowings were
outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company classified $5,400 and $4,190, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital within one year, as the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced
by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

Note 17 

Long-Term Debt

Total long-term debt,
excluding capital leases, at December 31, 2010, was $11,003. The company s
long-term debt outstanding at year-end 2010 and 2009 was as follows:

Long-term debt of
 $5,636 matures as follows: 2011   $33;  2012   $1,520;  2013   $20; 2014  
$2,020; 2015   $0; and after  2015   $2,043. 

In 2010, $30 of bonds matured. In 2009, $5,000 of public bonds was issued, and $400 of Texaco
Capital Inc. bonds matured.

New Accounting Standards

Transfers
and Servicing (ASC 860), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009-16)   The
FASB issued ASU 2009-16 in December 2009. This standard became effective for the company on January
1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 changes how companies account for transfers of financial assets and eliminates
the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities. Adoption of the guidance did not have an effect
on the company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Consolidation (ASC 810), Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved With
Variable Interest Entities  (ASU
2009-17)     The FASB issued ASU 2009-17 in December 2009. This standard
became effective for the company January 1, 2010. ASU 2009-17 requires the enterprise to
qualitatively assess if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable-interest entity (VIE), and if
so, the VIE must be consolidated. Adoption of the standard did not have an impact on the company s
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Receivables (ASC 310), Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the
Allowance for Credit Losses  (ASU
2010-20)     In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20, which became
effective with the company s reporting at December 31, 2010. This standard amends and expands
disclosure requirements about the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance
for credit losses. As a result of these amendments, companies are required to disaggregate, by
portfolio segment or class of financing receivable, certain existing disclosures and provide
certain new disclosures about financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses.
Adoption of the standard did not change the company s existing disclosures.

Note 19 

Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells

Accounting standards for the costs of exploratory wells
(ASC 932) provide that exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized after the completion of
drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
producing well and (b) the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if an enterprise
obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed
to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. (Note that an
entity is not required to complete the exploratory or exploratory-type stratigraphic well as a
producing well.) The accounting standards provide a number of indicators that can assist an entity
in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic

viability of the project.  The following table indicates the changes to the company s suspended
exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2010:

The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for
which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the
completion of drilling.

* 
       
     Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both. 

Of the $2,299 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31,
2010, $982 (26 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly
planned for the near future. The $1,317 balance is related to 27 projects in areas requiring a major
capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were
not under way or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary
because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in
process to enable a future decision on project development.

The projects for the $1,317 referenced above had the following activities associated with
assessing the reserves and the projects  economic viability: (a) $501 (three projects)   project
sanction approved and construction is in progress, with initial recognition of proved reserves expected upon
 reaching  economic producibility  per SEC guidelines;
(b) $263 (six projects)   development alternatives under review;
(c) $178 (three projects)   in
process of entering contracts for front-end engineering and design;
(d) $154 (three projects)

53 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may
not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the
projects. The majority of these decisions are expected to occur in the next three years.

The $2,299 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of
December 31, 2010, represents 176 exploratory wells in 53
projects. The tables below contain the
aging of these costs on a well and project basis:

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for stock options for 2010,
2009 and 2008 was $229 ($149 after tax), $182 ($119 after tax) and $168 ($109 after tax), respectively. In
addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance units
and restricted stock units was $194 ($126 after tax), $170 ($110 after tax) and $132 ($86 after
tax) for 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at
December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Cash received in payment for option
exercises under all
 share-based  payment arrangements for
2010, 2009 and 2008 was $385, $147 and $404, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from
option exercises were $66, $25 and $103 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $140, $89 and $136 for
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)   Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through January 2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the LTIP, and no more than 64 million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards outstanding as of December 31, 2010,
the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance units and 10 years for the stock
options and stock appreciation rights.

Texaco Stock Incentive Plan (Texaco SIP)   On the closing of the acquisition of Texaco in October
2001, outstanding options granted under the Texaco SIP were converted to Chevron options. These
options, which have 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. This provision enables a participant who exercises a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares
exchanged or withheld. The restored
options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price is the
market value of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. Beginning in 2007,
restored options were issued under the LTIP. No further awards may be granted under the former
Texaco plans.

Unocal Share-Based Plans (Unocal Plans)   When Chevron acquired Unocal in August 2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various Unocal Plans were exchanged for
fully vested Chevron options and appreciation rights. These awards retained the same provisions as
the original Unocal Plans. Unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to
expire through early 2015.

Compensation - Continued  

The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2010, 2009 and
2008 were measured on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

1  
       
     Expected term is based on historical exercise and postvesting cancellation data. 

2  
       
     Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate
period, generally equal to the expected term. 

A
summary of option activity during 2010 is presented below:

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market
price) of options exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $259, $91 and $433, respectively. During
this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these
awards.

As of
December 31, 2010, there was $242 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans. That
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

At
January 1, 2010, the number of LTIP performance units outstanding was equivalent to
2,679,108 shares. During 2010, 1,104,000 units were granted, 881,759 units vested
 with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 173,475 units were forfeited. At December 31,
2010, units outstanding were 2,727,874, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these
instruments was $266. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other
awards that were
granted under various LTIP and former Texaco and Unocal programs totaled approximately
1.6 million
equivalent shares as of December 31, 2010. A liability of $40 was recorded for these awards.

In
March 2009, Chevron granted all eligible LTIP employees restricted stock units in lieu of
an annual cash bonus. A total of 453,965 units were granted at $69.70 per unit at the time of the
grant. The expense associated with these special restricted stock units was recognized in 2009. All
of the special restricted stock units were distributed in November 2010.

Employee Benefit Plans

The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds
defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding
provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund
U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and
regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment
returns may be less attractive than the company s other investment alternatives.

The company also sponsors other postretirement (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental
benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are
unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible
retirees in the company s main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D) and
the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4
percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.

Under accounting standards for postretirement benefits (ASC 715),
the company recognizes the
overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset
or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The
funded status of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans for 2010 and
2009 is on the following page:

The accumulated benefit obligations for all U.S. and international pension plans were
$9,535 and $4,161, respectively, at December 31, 2010, and $8,707 and $4,029, respectively, at
December 31, 2009.

The components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive
income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are shown in the table below:

Net actuarial losses
recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  at December 31,
2010, for the company s U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over approximately 10, 12 and 10 years,
respectively. These amortization
periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits
under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of
the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to
amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During 2011, the company estimates actuarial
losses of $314, $114 and $64 will be amortized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  for U.S.
pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respec -

tively. In addition, the company
estimates an additional $250 will be recognized from  Accumulated
other comprehensive loss  during 2011 related to lump-sum settlement costs from U.S.
pension plans.

The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded
in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  at December 31, 2010, was approximately seven and 11
years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and 12 years for other postretirement
benefit plans. During 2011, the company estimates prior service
(credits) costs of $(8), $27 and
$(72) will be amortized from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  for U.S. pension, international
pension and OPEB plans, respectively.

Assumptions  The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit
obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:

Expected Return on Plan Assets  The company s estimated long-term rates of return on
pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of
expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific
asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan
asset/liability studies, and the company s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with
these studies.

There have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for U.S. plans, which account for 70 percent of the company s pension plan assets. At December 31,
2010, the estimated long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 7.8 percent.

The market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end
measurement date, as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting
rules. Management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-today market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year.
For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

Discount Rate  The discount rate assumptions used to determine U.S. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. At December 31, 2010, the company selected a 4.8
percent discount rate for the U.S. pension plan and 5.0 percent for the U.S. postretirement benefit
plan. This rate was based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the Citigroup Pension Discount Yield Curve as of  year-end 2010.  The discount rates at the end of
2009 were 5.3 percent and 5.8 percent for the U.S. pension plan and the U.S. OPEB plan,
respectively. The discount rate at the end of

2008 was 6.3 percent for both the U.S. pension plan and the U.S. OPEB plan.

Other Benefit Assumptions  For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 2010, for the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care
cost-trend rates start with 8 percent in 2011 and gradually decline to 5 percent for 2018 and
beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2009, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started
with 7 percent in 2010 and gradually declined to 5 percent for 2018 and beyond. In both
measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent.

Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. The impact is mitigated by the 4 percent cap on the company s medical
contributions for the primary U.S. plan. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan Assets and Investment Strategy  The accounting standards for defined benefit pension and
OPEB plans (ASC 715) provide users of financial statements with an understanding of: how investment
allocation decisions are made; the major classes of plan assets; the inputs and valuation
techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; the effect of fair value measurements
using unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period; and significant concentrations
of risk within plan assets.

The fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided
into three levels:

FS-55 

Table of Contents   

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts  

Note
21    Employee Benefit Plans - Continued 

Level 1: Fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices
for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability
to access.

Level 2: Fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in
active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. If the

asset has a contractual term, the Level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of
the asset. The fair values for Level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker
quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges.

Level 3: Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. Valuation may
be performed using a financial model with estimated inputs entered into the model.

The fair value measurements of the company s pension plans for 2010 are below:

1  

     U.S. equities include investments in the company s common stock in the amount of
$38 at December 31, 2010 and  $ 29 at December 31, 2009. 

2  

     Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds for U.S. plans are entirely index funds; for
International plans, they are mostly index funds. For these index funds, the Level 2
designation is partially based on the restriction that advance notification of redemptions,
typically two business days, is required. 

3  

     Mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income
instruments in order to diversify and lower risk. 

4  

     The year-end valuations of the U.S. real estate assets are based on internal
appraisals by the real estate managers, which are updates of third-party appraisals that occur
at least once a year for each property in the portfolio. 

5  

     The  Other  asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet
settled (Level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (Level 2); insurance
contracts and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (Level 3). 

6  

     Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to their 2010 presentation. 

FS-56

Note

The effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes
in Level 3 plan assets for the period are outlined below:

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest
rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate
potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for
benefit payments and portfolio management.

The company s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 86 percent of the total pension assets.
Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to
review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans  investment performance, long-term
asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.

For the primary U.S. pension plan, the Chevron Board of Directors has established the
following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 40-70 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 20-65
percent, Real Estate 0-15 percent, and Other 0-5 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board
of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed
regularly: Equities 60-80 percent and Fixed Income and Cash 20-40 percent. The other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that
vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current
economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. There are no
significant concentrations of risk in plan assets due to the diversification of investment classes.

The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.

Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments  In 2010, the company contributed $1,192 and $258 to its
U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2011, the company expects contributions to
be approximately $650 and $300 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. Actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

The company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $225 in 2011,
as compared with $183 paid in 2010.

The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be
paid by the company in the next 10 years:

Note 21    Employee Benefit Plans - Continued 

Employee Savings Investment Plan  Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP).

Charges to expense for the ESIP represent the company s contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP), which is
described in the section that follows. Total company matching contributions to employee accounts
within the ESIP were $253, $257, and $231 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This cost was
reduced by the value of shares released from the LESOP totaling $97, $184 and $40 in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively. The remaining amounts, totaling $156, $73 and $191 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, represent open market purchases.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan  Within the Chevron ESIP is an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
In 1989, Chevron established a LESOP as a constituent part of the ESOP. The LESOP provides partial
prefunding of the company s future commitments to the ESIP.

As permitted by accounting standards for share-based compensation (ASC 718), the debt of the
LESOP is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as  Deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Equity.

The company reports compensation expense equal to LESOP debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the LESOP for debt service. Interest accrued on LESOP debt is
recorded as interest expense. Dividends paid on LESOP shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. All LESOP shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.

Total credits to expense for the LESOP were $1, $3 and $1 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The net credit for the respective years was composed of credits to compensation
expense of $6, $15 and $15 and charges to interest expense for LESOP debt of $5, $12 and $14.

Of the dividends paid on the LESOP shares, $46, $110 and $35 were used in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, to service LESOP debt. No contributions were required in 2010, 2009 or 2008, as
dividends received by the LESOP were sufficient to satisfy LESOP debt service.

Shares held in the LESOP are released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants
based on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of

current-year and remaining debt service. LESOP shares as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, were as
follows:

Benefit Plan Trusts  Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan
trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2010, the trust
contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the
dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such
benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The
trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust s beneficiaries. The
shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until
distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.

Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund
obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental
retirement plans. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, trust assets of $57 were invested primarily in
interest-earning accounts.

Employee Incentive Plans  The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible
employees that links awards to corporate, unit and individual performance in the prior year.
Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $766, $561 and $757 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its
subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of
stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 20, on page FS-51.

Note 22 

Equity

Retained earnings at December 31, 2010 and 2009, included approximately $9,159 and $8,122,
respectively, for the company s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates. 

At December
31, 2010, about 81 million shares of Chevron s common stock remained available for issuance from
the 160 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Corporation Long-Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP).

FS-58

In addition, approximately 280,000 shares remain available for issuance from the
800,000 shares of the company s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron
Corporation  Non-Employee  Directors  Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.

Note 23 

Restructuring and Reorganization

In the first quarter 2010, the company announced employee reduction programs related to the
restructuring and reorganization of its downstream businesses and corporate staffs. The initial
estimate included approximately 3,200 employees in Downstream and 600 employees from corporate
staffs that were expected to be terminated under the programs. Due to redeployment efforts within
the company, total employee terminations under the programs are expected to be reduced from
approximately 3,800 employees to approximately 3,200 employees. About 1,500 of the affected
employees are located in the United States. About 1,500 employees have been terminated to date, and
the programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2011.

A before-tax charge of $244 ($175 after tax) was recorded in first quarter 2010, with $191
reported as  Operating expenses  and $53 as  Selling, general and administrative expenses  on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Due to the reduction in terminations resulting from reassignments
within the company, an adjustment to total charges was made in fourth quarter 2010, which
effectively reduced the total before-tax charge from $244 to $234 ($167 after tax). The accrued
liability is classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Approximately $71 ($45 after
tax) is associated with terminations in U.S. Downstream, $119 ($92 after tax) in International
Downstream and $44 ($30 after tax) in All Other.

During the last nine months of 2010, the company made payments of $96 associated with these
liabilities. The majority of the payments were in Downstream.

Note 24 

Other Contingencies and Commitments

Income
Taxes   The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. Refer to Note 15, beginning on page  FS-47,  for a discussion of the periods for which
tax returns have been audited for the company s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all
tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The company does not
expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Guarantees  The company s guarantee of approximately $600 is associated with certain payments under
a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. The terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. Over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.

Indemnifications  The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and
Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company s interests in those investments. The company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300. Through the end of 2010, the company paid $48 under these
indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification payments in the
future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the period of Texaco s ownership interest in the joint ventures. In general, the
environmental conditions or events

FS-59 

Table of Contents   

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts  

Note
24    Other Contingencies and Commitments - Continued 

that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to December 2001. Claims
had to be asserted by February 2009 for Equilon indemnities and must be asserted no later than
February 2012 for Motiva indemnities. Under the terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum
limit on the amount of potential future payments. The company posts no assets as collateral and has
made no payments under the indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by Equilon or
Motiva prior to September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those
assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which
had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200
obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
the sale of the assets in 1997.

Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable
and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay
Agreements  The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect
to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers  financing arrangements. The agreements
typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs,
utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company s
business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments
are: 2011   $17,200; 2012   $4,100; 2013   $3,500;
2014   $3,100; 2015   $3,000; 2016 and  after  
$7,700.  A portion of these commitments may

ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately
$6,500 in 2010, $8,100 in 2009 and $5,100 in 2008.

Environmental  The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private
claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements
or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects
on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the
company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the company s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

Chevron s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2010, was $1,507. Included in this balance
were remediation activities at approximately 182 sites for which the company had been identified as
a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund
law or analogous state laws. The company s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2010 was
$185. The federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability
for all responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require
Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties  costs at designated hazardous waste sites
are

FS-60 

Table of Contents   

Note
24    Other Contingencies and Commitments - Continued 

not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations,
consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Of the remaining year-end 2010 environmental reserves balance of $1,322, $814 related to the
company s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations
(i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. The remaining $508 was
associated with various sites in international downstream ($100), upstream ($329) and other
businesses ($79). Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the company s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state or
local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2010 had a recorded liability that was
material to the company s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.

Refer to Note 25 for a discussion of the company s asset retirement obligations.

Equity Redetermination  For crude oil and natural gas producing operations, ownership agreements may
provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas
reserves. These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be
material to earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for Chevron s interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum

Reserve at Elk Hills, California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were
owned by the U.S. Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount
for the four zones. For this range of settlement, Chevron estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed
to Chevron is estimated at about $150. The timing of the settlement and the exact amount within
this range of estimates are uncertain.

Other Contingencies  On April 26, 2010, a California appeals court issued a ruling related to the
adequacy of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) supporting the issuance of certain permits by the
city of Richmond, California, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at Chevron s refinery in
Richmond. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and
the company continues to evaluate its options going forward, which may include requesting the city
to revise the EIR to address the issues identified by the Court of Appeal or other actions.
Management believes the outcomes associated with the potential options for the project are
uncertain. Due to the uncertainty of the company s future course of action, or potential outcomes
of any action or combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial
effects, if any, of the ruling can be made at this time. However, the company s ultimate exposure
may be significant to net income in any one future period.

Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; U.S. federal,
state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. The amounts
of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to
resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.

Asset Retirement Obligations

In accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (ASC 410), the
company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) when there
is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible  long-lived  asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement
activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of
settlement that may be beyond the company s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or
method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information
exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of
a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation
of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.

Accounting standards for asset retirement obligations primarily affect the company s
accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any
legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate
settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated
ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in
facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.

The following table indicates the changes to the company s before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2010, 2009 and 2008:

In the table above, the amounts associated with  Revisions in estimated cash flows 
reflect increasing costs to abandon wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the
$12,488 balance at the end of 2010 was $11,788.

Table V  Reserve Quantity Information 

Reserves Governance   The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification
system modeled after a system developed and approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the
World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The system
classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting   three deemed commercial and three noncommercial. Within the commercial classification
are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. The noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known
reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net
proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual
arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.

Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves
are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of
reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and
engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the com-

pany maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the corporate reserves
manager, who is a member of a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman
responsible for the company s worldwide exploration and production activities. The corporate
reserves manager, who acts as chairman of the RAC, has more than 30 years experience working in the
oil and gas industry and a Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering degree from Stanford
University. His experience includes 15 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. He is the
acting chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee, currently
serves on the United Nations Expert Group on Resources Classification and is an active member of
the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. He is also a past member of the Joint Committee on
Reserves Evaluator Training and the California Conservation Committee.

All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 15 years experience in various
aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth
science, or accounting policy and financial reporting. The members are knowledgeable in SEC
guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of
reserves estimates. The RAC manages its activities through two operating company-level reserves
managers. These two reserves managers are not members of the RAC so as to preserve the
corporate-level independence.

The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used
within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the
business units  recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are
recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that

FS-71  

Table of Contents   

Table V   
  Reserve Quantity Information - Continued               

Summary of Net Oil and Gas Reserves 

reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and
technology; and maintain the  Corporate Reserves Manual,  which provides standardized procedures used
corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.

During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company s upstream
business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major
changes are also reviewed with the company s Strategy and Planning Committee, whose members
include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company s annual reserve
activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur
between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board.

RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have the
largest proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve
records and documentation of their compliance with the  Corporate Reserves Manual. 

Revised Oil and Gas Reporting   In December 2008, the SEC issued its final rule,  Modernization
of Oil and Gas 

Reporting.  The disclosure requirements under the final rule became effective for the company with
its Form 10-K filing for the year ending December 31, 2009. The final rule changed a number of oil
and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements under SEC Regulations S-K and S-X.
Subsequently, the FASB updated  Extractive Industries   Oil and Gas  (Topic 932) to align the oil
and gas reserves estimation and disclosure requirements with the SEC s final rule. The new
disclosure requirements have been applied to data reported for 2009 and 2010.

Proved Undeveloped Reserve Quantities   At the end of 2010, proved undeveloped
reserves for consolidated companies totaled 2.6 billion barrels
of oil-equivalent (BOE). Approximately 63 percent of these
reserves are attributed to natural gas, of which about half were located in Australia. Crude oil,
condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) accounted for about 32 percent of the total, with the
largest concentration of these reserves in Africa, Asia and the United States. Synthetic oil
accounted for the balance of the proved undeveloped reserves and was located in Canada in the Other
Americas region.

FS-72  

Table of Contents   

Table V   
  Reserve Quantity Information - Continued               

Proved
undeveloped reserves of equity affiliates amounted to
1.3 billion BOE. At year-end, crude oil, condensate and NGLs
represented 59 percent of these reserves, with TCO accounting for
the majority of this amount. Natural gas represented 25 percent of the total, with approximately 45
percent of those reserves from TCO. The balance is attributed to synthetic oil in Venezuela in the
Other region.

In
2010, a total of 447 million BOE was transferred from proved
undeveloped to proved developed for consolidated companies. In Other
Americas, 171 million BOE
were transferred, primarily due to startup of a synthetic crude expansion project in Canada. In the
Africa region, 135 million BOE were transferred to proved developed as a result of development
drilling in Nigeria and Angola and the start-up of a natural gas processing plant in Nigeria.
Transfers in Asia and the United States accounted for most of the remainder. Proved undeveloped
reserves for affiliated companies declined slightly, with 13 million BOE
transferred to proved developed.

There were no material downward revisions of proved undeveloped reserves for consolidated or
affiliated companies.

Investment to Convert Proved Undeveloped to Proved Developed Reserves   During 2010, investments
totaling approximately $8.3 billion were made by consolidated companies and equity affiliates to
advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In Australia, $2.6 billion was expended,
which was primarily driven by construction activities at the Gorgon LNG project. In the Africa
region, $2.1 billion was expended on various projects, including offshore development projects in
Nigeria and Angola. In Nigeria, construction progressed on a deepwater project and development
activities continued at a natural gas processing plant. In Angola, offshore development drilling
was progressed along with several gas injection projects. In the United States, expenditures
totaled $1.1 billion for three offshore development projects in the Gulf of Mexico and various
smaller development projects. In the Asia region, expenditures during the year totaled $0.9
billion, which included construction of a gas processing facility in Thailand, a gas development
project in China and the completion of a steam-flood project in Indonesia. In Other Americas,
development expenditures totaled $0.8 billion for a variety of projects, including a synthetic
crude project in Canada. In Europe, $0.1 billion was expended on various development projects.
Affiliated companies expended $0.7 billion, primarily on an LNG project in Angola.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves for Five Years or More   
Reserves that remain classified as proved
undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several physical factors that affect optimal
project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse
and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate
project timing, compression projects that are

pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.

At year-end 2010, the company held approximately 1.7 billion BOE of proved undeveloped
reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The reserves are held by
consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the
company has a proven track record of developing major projects.

In Africa, approximately 330 million BOE is related to deepwater and natural gas
developments in Nigeria and Angola. Major Nigerian deepwater development projects include Agbami,
which started production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full
utilization of infrastructure capacity, and the Usan development, which is under construction and
is expected to enter production in 2012. Also in Nigeria, various fields and infrastructure
associated with the Escravos Gas Projects are currently under development. In Angola, the
Tombua-Landana deepwater project became operational in 2009. Ongoing development drilling is
expected to bring this field to maximum production in 2011.

In Asia, approximately 230 million BOE are related to continued development of the Pattani
Field in the Gulf of Thailand and contractual constraints at the Malampaya Field (Philippines). The
timing of compression installation aligns with natural field declines and/or to meet contractual
requirements. Ongoing development is scheduled to maintain production within the infrastructure
constraints.

In Australia, approximately 130 million BOE remain undeveloped over five years due to
future compression projects at the North West Shelf Venture, scheduled for 2013.

In the United States, approximately 70 million BOE remain proved undeveloped, primarily
related to a steamflood expansion.

Affiliated companies hold approximately 940 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves
held for five years or more. The TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan accounts for approximately
800 million BOE. Field production is constrained by plant capacity limitations. Further field
development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with
reservoir depletion.

In Venezuela, the affiliate that operates the Hamaca Field s synthetic heavy oil upgrading
operation accounts for about 140 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves held over five
years. Development drilling continues at Hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity.

Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances,
such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a
revision to reserve estimates. For 2010, this assessment did not result in any material changes in
reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved
undeveloped reserves to total proved

FS-73  

Table of Contents   

Table V   
  Reserve Quantity Information - Continued               

reserves has ranged between 35 percent and 39 percent. The consistent completion of major capital
projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period.

Proved Reserve Quantities   
At December 31, 2010, proved reserves for the company s
consolidated operations were 7.7 billion BOE. (Refer to the term  Reserves  on page E-26 for
the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) Approximately 22 percent of the total reserves were
located in the United States. For the company s interests in equity affiliates,
proved reserves were 2.8 billion BOE, 79 percent of which were associated with the company s 50
percent ownership in TCO.

Aside from the Tengiz Field in the TCO affiliate, no single property accounted for more than 5
percent of the company s total oil-equivalent proved reserves. About 25 other individual
properties in the company s portfolio of assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent of
the company s oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for 49 percent of
the company s total  oil-equivalent proved reserves. These properties were geographically dispersed, located in
the United States, Canada, South America, West Africa, Asia, and Australia.

In
the United States, total proved reserves at year-end 2010 were
1.7 billion BOE.
California properties accounted for 43 percent of the U.S. reserves, with most classified as heavy
oil. Because of heavy oil s high viscosity and the need

to employ enhanced recovery methods, the producing operations are capital intensive in
nature. Most of the company s heavy-oil fields in California employ a continuous steamflooding
process. The Gulf of Mexico region contains 21 percent of the U.S. reserves, with liquids
representing about 15 percent of reserves. Production operations are mostly offshore and, as a
result, are also capital intensive. Other U.S. areas represent the remaining 36 percent of U.S.
reserves, which are about evenly split between liquids and natural gas. For production of crude
oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including waterflood and CO 2
 injection.

For the three years ending December 31, 2010, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the
company s ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and
circumstances that are outside the company s control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, declines in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest.

The company s estimated net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and
synthetic oil, and changes thereto for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 are shown in the
table on the following page. The company s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page FS-77.

Net Proved Reserves of Crude Oil, Condensate, Natural Gas Liquids and Synthetic Oil

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved reserve changes for 2008 through
2010 are discussed below:

Revisions   In 2008, net revisions increased reserves by 536 million barrels for
worldwide consolidated companies and increased reserves by 267 million barrels for equity
affiliates. For consolidated companies, the largest increase was in the Asia region, which added
574 million barrels. The majority of the increase was in the Partitioned Zone, as a result of a
concession extension, and Indonesia. In Indonesia, reserves increased due mainly to the impact of
lower year-end prices on the reserve calculations for  production-sharing  contracts, as well as a
result of development drilling and improved waterflood and steamflood performance. Upward revisions
were also recorded in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and were mainly associated with the effect of lower
year-end prices on the calculation of reserves associated with  production-sharing and
variable-royalty contracts. These increases were offset by downward revisions in Europe and the
United States. For affiliated companies, the 249 million-barrel increase for TCO was due to the
effect of lower year-end prices on the royalty

determination and the effect of facility optimization at the Tengiz and Korolev fields.

In 2009, net revisions increased reserves by 355 million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and decreased reserves by 187 million barrels for equity affiliates. For consolidated
companies, the largest increase was 460 million barrels in the Other Americas region due to the
inclusion of synthetic oil related to Canadian oil sands. In the United States, reserves increased
63 million barrels as a result of development drilling and performance revisions. The increases
were partially offset by decreases of 121 million barrels in Asia and 46 million barrels in Africa.
In Asia, decreases in Indonesia and Azerbaijan were driven by the effect of higher 12-month average
prices on the calculation of reserves associated with production-sharing contracts and the effect
of reservoir performance revisions. In Africa, reserves in Nigeria declined as a result of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts as well as reservoir performance.

For affiliated companies, TCO declined by 184 million barrels primarily due to the effect of
higher 12-month average

FS-75  

Table of Contents   

Table V  
Reserve Quantity Information - Continued

prices on royalty determination. For Other affiliated companies, 266 million barrels of heavy crude
oil were reclassified to synthetic oil for the activities in Venezuela.

In 2010, net revisions increased reserves 103 million barrels for consolidated companies and
decreased reserves 21 million barrels for affiliated companies. For consolidated companies,
improved reservoir performance and recovery factors accounted for a majority of the 63 million
barrel increase in the United States. Increases in the other regions were partially offset by the
Asia region, which decreased as a result of the effect of higher prices on   production-sharing 
contracts in Kazakhstan. For affiliated companies, the price effect on royalty determination at TCO
decreased reserves by 33 million barrels. This was partially offset by improved reservoir
performance and development drilling in Venezuela.

Improved Recovery   In 2008, improved recovery increased worldwide liquids volumes by
37 million barrels. For consolidated companies, the largest addition was in the Asia region related
to gas reinjection in Kazakhstan. Affiliated companies increased reserves 10 million barrels due to
improved secondary recovery at Boscan.

In 2009, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 86 million barrels worldwide.
Consolidated companies accounted for 50 million barrels. The largest addition was related to
improved secondary recovery in Nigeria. Affiliated companies increased reserves 36 million barrels
due to improvements related to the TCO Sour Gas Injection/Second Generation Plant (SGI/SGP)
facilities.

In 2010, improved recovery increased volumes by 77 million barrels worldwide. For consolidated
companies, reserves in Africa increased 58 million barrels due primarily to secondary recovery
performance in Nigeria. Reserves in the United States increased 11 million, primarily in California. Affiliated companies increased reserves 3 million
barrels.

Extensions and Discoveries   In 2008, extensions and discoveries increased
consolidated company reserves 33 million barrels worldwide. The United States increased reserves 17
million barrels, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. The Africa, Asia, and Other Americas regions
increased reserves 16 million barrels with no one country resulting in additions greater than 5
million barrels.

In 2009, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 52 million barrels worldwide.
The largest additions were 20 million barrels in the Australia region related to the Gorgon Project
and 13 million barrels in the Other Americas region related to delineation drilling in Argentina.
Africa and the United States accounted for 10 million barrels and 6 million barrels, respectively.

In 2010, extensions and discoveries increased consolidated companies reserves 63 million
barrels worldwide. The United States and Other Americas each increased reserves 19 million barrels,
and Asia increased reserves 16 million barrels. No single area in the United States was
individually significant. Drilling activity in Argentina and Brazil accounted for the majority of
the increase in Other Americas. In Asia, the increase was primarily related to activity in
Azerbaijan.

Net Proved Reserves of Natural Gas

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas   proved-reserve  changes for 2008
through 2010 are discussed below:

Revisions   In 2008, net revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by
1,166 BCF and increased reserves for affiliated companies by 1,130 BCF. In the Asia region,
positive revisions totaled 1,073 BCF for consolidated companies. Almost half of the increase was
attributed to the Karachaganak Field in Kazakhstan, due mainly to the effects of low year-end
prices on the production-sharing contract and the results of development drilling and improved
recovery. Other large upward revisions were recorded for the Pattani Field in Thailand due to a
successful drilling campaign. In the Other Americas region, improved field performance and new
contracts in Colombia, and Trinidad and Tobago, respectively, accounted for most of the 154 BCF
increase.

For the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, an increase of 498 BCF reflected the impacts of lower
year-end prices on royalty determination and facility optimization. Reserves associated with the
Angola LNG project accounted for a majority of the 632 BCF increase in Other affiliated companies.

In 2009, net revisions increased reserves 569 BCF for consolidated companies and decreased
reserves 44 BCF for affiliated companies. For consolidated companies, net increases were 493 BCF in
Asia, primarily as a result of reservoir studies in Bangladesh and development drilling in
Thailand. These results were partially offset by a downward revision due to the impact of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts in Myanmar. In the Australia region, the 166 BCF increase in
reserves resulted from improved reservoir performance and compression. In the Other Americas
region, reserves decreased 126 BCF, driven primarily by the effect of higher prices on
production-sharing contracts in Trinidad and Tobago. In the United States, a net increase of 39 BCF
was the result of development drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by performance
revisions in the California and   mid-continent  areas.

For equity affiliates, a downward revision of 237 BCF at TCO was due to the effect of higher
prices on royalty determination and an increase in gas injection for SGI/SGP facilities. This
decline was partially offset by performance and drilling opportunities related to the Angola LNG
project.

In 2010, net revisions increased reserves by 197 BCF for consolidated companies, which was
more than offset by a 268 BCF decrease in net revisions for affiliated companies. For consolidated
companies, a net increase in the United States of 220 BCF, primarily in the mid-continent area and
the Gulf of Mexico, was the result of a number of small upward revisions related to improved
reservoir performance and drilling activity, none of which were individually significant. The
increase was partially offset by downward revisions due to the impact of higher prices on
production-sharing contracts in the Asia region. For equity affiliates, a downward revision of 324
BCF at TCO was due to the price effect on royalty determination and a change in the
variable-royalty calculation. This decline was partially offset by the recognition of additional
reserves related to the Angola LNG project.

Extensions and Discoveries   In 2009, worldwide extensions and discoveries of 4,387
BCF were attributed to consolidated companies. In Australia, the Gorgon Project accounted for all
of the 4,276 BCF additions. In Asia, development drilling in Thailand accounted for the majority of
the increase. In the United States, delineation drilling in California accounted for the majority
of the increase.

Sales   In 2009, worldwide sales of 117 BCF were related to consolidated companies.
For the Other Americas region, the sale of properties in Argentina accounted for 84 BCF. The sale
of properties in the Gulf of Mexico accounted for the majority of the 33 BCF decrease in the United
States.

Table VI   
 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash 
 Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves  

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil
and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the FASB. Estimated future
cash inflows from production are computed by applying 12-month average prices for oil and gas to
year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those
provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. Future
development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and
produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of
year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations.
Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates.
These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax
net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are
calculated using 10 percent midperiod discount factors. Discounting requires

a year-by-year estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be
produced.

The information provided does not represent management s estimate of the company s expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The
valuation prescribed by the FASB requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future
development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and should
not be relied upon as an indication of the company s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas
reserves. In the following table,  Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows  refers to the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows.

     Based on 12-month average price.

 Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted 
 Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves 

The changes in present values between years, which can be significant, reflect changes in
estimated proved-reserve quantities and prices and assumptions used in forecasting

production volumes and costs. Changes in the timing of production are included with  Revisions of
previous quantity estimates.

Exhibit 99.1  

DEFINITIONS
    OF SELECTED ENERGY TERMS  

Barrels
    of oil-equivalent (BOE)  

A unit of measure to quantify crude oil, natural gas liquids and
    natural gas amounts using the same basis. Natural gas volumes
    are converted to barrels on the basis of energy content. See
     oil-equivalent gas  and  production .

Development  

Drilling, construction and related activities following
    discovery that are necessary to begin production and
    transportation of crude oil and natural gas.

Exploration  

Searching for crude oil
     and/or 
    natural gas by utilizing geologic and topographical studies,
    geophysical and seismic surveys, and drilling of wells.

Gas-to-liquids 
    (GTL)  

A process that converts natural gas into high-quality
    transportation fuels and other products.

Liquefied
    natural gas (LNG)  

Natural gas that is liquefied under extremely cold temperatures
    to facilitate storage or transportation in specially designed
    vessels.

Liquefied
    petroleum gas (LPG)  

Light gases, such as butane and propane, that can be maintained
    as liquids while under pressure.

Oil-equivalent
    gas (OEG)  

The volume of natural gas needed to generate the equivalent
    amount of heat as a barrel of crude oil. Approximately 6,000
    cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of crude
    oil.

Oil
    sands  

Naturally occurring mixture of bitumen   a heavy,
    viscous form of crude oil   water, sand and clay.
    Using hydroprocessing technology, bitumen can be refined to
    yield  synthetic oil. 

Production  

Total production  refers to all the crude oil (including
    synthetic oil), natural gas liquids and natural gas produced
    from a property.  Gross production  is the company s
    share of total production before deducting both royalties paid
    to landowners and a government s
     agreed-upon 
    share of production under a  production-sharing contract. Net
    production  is gross production minus both royalties paid to
    landowners and a government s
     agreed-upon 
    share of production under a  production-sharing contract.
    Oil-equivalent production  is the sum of the barrels of
    liquids and the oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced.
    See  barrels of oil-equivalent  and  oil-equivalent
    gas. 

Production-sharing
    contract (PSC)  

An agreement between a government and a contractor (generally an
    oil and gas company) whereby production is shared between the
    parties in a prearranged manner. The contractor typically incurs
    all exploration, development and production costs, which are
    subsequently recoverable out of an
     agreed-upon 
    share of any future PSC production, referred to as cost recovery
    oil  and/or 
    gas. Any remaining production, referred to as profit oil
     and/or  gas,
    is shared between the parties on

E-25

an
     agreed-upon 
    basis as stipulated in the PSC. The government may also retain a
    share of PSC production as a royalty payment, and the contractor
    may owe income taxes on its portion of the profit oil or gas.
    The contractor s share of PSC oil
     and/or  gas
    production and reserves varies over time, as it is dependent on
    prices, costs and specific PSC terms.

Reserves  

Crude oil or natural gas contained in underground rock
    formations called reservoirs and saleable hydrocarbons extracted
    from oil sands, shale, coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural
    resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or
    gas.  Proved reserves  are the estimated quantities that
    geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
    certainty to be economically producible in the future from known
    reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods
    and government regulations. Estimates change as additional
    information becomes available.  Oil-equivalent reserves
     are the sum of the liquids reserves and the oil-equivalent
    gas reserves. See  barrels of oil-equivalent  and
     oil-equivalent gas. 

Shale
    gas  

Natural gas produced from shale (clay-rich, very fine grained)
    formations where the gas was sourced from within the shale
    itself and is trapped in rocks with low porosity and extremely
    low permeability. Production of shale gas requires the use of
    hydraulic fracturing (pumping a fluid-sand mixture into the
    formation under high pressure) to help produce the gas.

Synthetic
    oil  

A marketable and transportable hydrocarbon liquid, resembling
    crude oil, that is produced by upgrading highly viscous or solid
    hydrocarbons, such as extra-heavy crude oil or  oil sands .

E-26

DEFINITIONS
    OF SELECTED FINANCIAL TERMS  

Earnings  

The term  earnings  is net income attributable to Chevron
    Corporation as presented on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Goodwill  

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits
    arising from other assets acquired in a business combination
    that are not individually identified and separately recognized.

Return on
    capital employed (ROCE)  

ROCE is calculated by dividing  earnings  (adjusted for
    after-tax interest expense and noncontrolling interests) by the
    average of total debt, noncontrolling interests and Chevron
    Corporation stockholders  equity for the year.

Return on
    stockholders  equity  

Return on stockholders  equity is  earnings  divided
    by average Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity.
    Average Chevron Corporation stockholders  equity is
    computed by averaging the sum of the
     beginning-of-year 
    and
     end-of-year 
    balances.

Exhibit 99.2  

Mine
    Safety Disclosure  

Chevron is an operator of the following coal and molybdenum
    mines for which reporting requirements apply under
    Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
    Consumer Protection Act as a result of citations and orders
    received from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)
    during the year ending December 31, 2010. In evaluating
    this information, consideration should be given to factors such
    as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary
    depending on the size of the mine, (ii) the number of
    citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine
    to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested
    and appealed, and in that process, are often reduced in severity
    and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.

The items in the table below refer to the applicable sections of
    the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration Act of 1977
    under which the citations and orders were received.
