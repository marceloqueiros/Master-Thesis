PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively  we  or  our ) is a global integrated
biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of
innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory related diseases. We are
dedicated to innovative research and development which is designed to bring new therapies to market
and are involved in research in several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary
next-generation therapies, targeting areas such as intracellular signaling pathways in cancer and
immune cells, immunomodulation in cancer and autoimmunity and placental cell, including stem and
progenitor cell, research. The drug and cell therapies we develop are designed to treat
life-threatening diseases or chronic debilitating conditions. Building on our growing knowledge of
the biology underlying hematological and solid tumor cancers as well as in immune-inflammatory
diseases, we are investing in a range of innovative therapeutic programs that are investigating
ways to treat and manage chronic diseases by targeting the disease source through multiple
mechanisms of action.

Our commercial stage products include REVLIMID   , THALOMID    (inclusive of
Thalidomide Celgene TM  and Thalidomide Pharmion TM , subsequent to the
acquisition of Pharmion Corporation, or Pharmion), VIDAZA    and FOCALIN   .
FOCALIN    is sold exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. We also derive
revenues from a licensing agreement with Novartis, which entitles us to royalties on FOCALIN
XR    and the entire RITALIN    family of drugs, and sales of bio-therapeutic
products and services through our Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary. ALKERAN    was
licensed from GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, and sold under our label through March 31, 2009, the
conclusion date of the ALKERAN    license with GSK. For the ensuing two years, we will
continue to earn residual payments based upon GSK s ALKERAN    revenues.

In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and, in July 1987, completed an initial public
offering. Our initial operations focused on the research and development of chemical and
biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. We subsequently completed
the following strategic acquisitions to strengthen our research and manufacturing capabilities in
addition to enhancing our commercialized products:

In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., currently Signal
Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery
and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease.

In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., a privately held New Jersey-based
biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, developing technologies for the
recovery of stem cells from human placental tissues following the completion of full-term,
successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis d/b/a Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now
operates as our wholly owned subsidiary engaged in the research, recovery,
culture-expansion, preservation, development and distribution of placental cells, including
stem and progenitor cells, as therapeutic agents.

In October 2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, a UK-based global supplier of
THALOMID   . This acquisition expanded our corporate capabilities and enabled us
to control manufacturing for THALOMID    worldwide.

In December 2006, we acquired an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing
facility from Siegfried Ltd. and Siegfried Dienste AG (together  Siegfried ) located in
Zofingen, Switzerland. The manufacturing facility has the capability to produce multiple
drug substances
and is being used to produce REVLIMID    and THALOMID    API to supply
global markets. The facility may also be used to produce drug substance for our future
drugs and drug candidates.

In March 2008, we acquired Pharmion Corporateion, or Pharmion, a global
biopharmaceutical company that acquired, developed and commercialized innovative products
for the treatment of hematology and oncology patients. Pharmion was acquired to enhance
our portfolio of therapies for patients with life-threatening illnesses worldwide with the
addition of Pharmion s marketed products, and several products in development for the
treatment of hematological and solid tumor cancers. By combining this new product
portfolio with our existing operational and financial capabilities, we enlarged our global
market share through increased product offerings and expanded clinical, regulatory and
commercial capabilities.

In January 2010, we acquired Gloucester Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Gloucester, a privately held
pharmaceutical company, for $340.0 million in cash plus $300.0 million in contingent regulatory
milestone payments. The acquisition is expected to advance our leadership position in the
development of disease-altering therapies through innovative approaches for patients with rare and
debilitating blood cancers. Gloucester developed ISTODAX    (romidepsin),
which was approved in November 2009 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the
treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, in patients who have received at least one prior
systemic therapy. Additionally, ISTODAX    has received both orphan drug designation for
the treatment of non-Hodgkin s T-cell lymphomas, which includes CTCL and peripheral T-cell
lymphoma, or PTCL, and fast track status in PTCL from the FDA. The European Agency for the
Evaluation of Medicinal Products, or EMEA, has granted orphan status designation for
ISTODAX    for the treatment of both CTCL and PTCL.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we reported revenue of $2.690 billion, net income of $776.7
million and diluted earnings per share of $1.66. Revenue increased by $435.1 million in 2009
compared to 2008 primarily due to our continuing expansion into international markets and growth of
REVLIMID    and VIDAZA   , which more than offset decreases in revenues from
THALOMID    and ALKERAN   . The decrease in THALOMID    was primarily
due to lower unit volumes in the United States resulting from the increased use of
REVLIMID   , while the decrease in ALKERAN    was due to the March 31, 2009
conclusion of the ALKERAN    license with GSK. Net income and earnings per share for 2009
reflect the earnings contributions from higher REVLIMID    and VIDAZA   
revenues, partly offset by increased spending for new product launches, research and development
and expansion of our international operations. The year ended December 31, 2008 included a $1.740
billion charge for acquired in-process research and development, or IPR D, related to the Pharmion
acquisition in March 2008.

Our future growth and operating results will depend on the continued acceptance of our currently
marketed products, regulatory approvals and successful commercialization of new products and new
product indications, depth of our product pipeline, competition with our marketed products and
challenges to our intellectual property. See also Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS 

REVLIMID        (lenalidomide)   :   REVLIMID    is an oral immunomodulatory drug
approved by the FDA and a number of other regulatory agencies in Europe, Latin America, Middle East
and Asia/Pacific for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who
have received at least one prior therapy and in Australia and New Zealand in combination with
dexamethasone for the treatment of patients whose disease has progressed after one therapy.

In addition, REVLIMID    was approved by the regulatory agencies in the United States,
Canada, and a number of countries in Latin America for treatment of patients with
transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS,
associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic
abnormalities.

We continue to launch REVLIMID    in European markets and are preparing to launch in Latin
America, the Middle East and Asia/Pacific. REVLIMID    has obtained orphan drug
designation for the treatment of MDS in the United States and a number of international markets.

REVLIMID    is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies
under the RevAssist    program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution
program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of
REVLIMID   . Internationally, REVLIMID    is also distributed under mandatory
risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities  specifications
to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID   . These
programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management
program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.

REVLIMID    continues to be evaluated in numerous clinical trials worldwide either alone
or in combination with one or more other therapies in the treatment of a broad range of
hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, MDS, non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, or NHL,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, other cancers and other diseases.

THALOMID          (thalidomide)   :   THALOMID    has been approved by the FDA for
use in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema
nodosum leprosum, or ENL, and as maintenance therapy for prevention and suppression of the
cutaneous manifestation of ENL recurrence. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, or
TGA, approved a supplemental filing granting THALOMID    marketing approval for use in
combination with melphalan and prednisone for patients with untreated multiple myeloma or
ineligible for high dose chemotherapy, and also granted THALOMID    marketing approval in
combination with dexamethasone for induction therapy prior to high dose chemotherapy with
autologous stem cell rescue, for the treatment of patients with untreated multiple myeloma. In
addition, THALOMID    was granted full marketing authorization by the European Commission,
or EC, for use in combination with melphalan and prednisone as a treatment for patients with newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma.

THALOMID    is distributed in the United States under our   System for Thalidomide
Education and Prescribing Safety ,  or S.T.E.P.S.   , program which we developed and is a
proprietary comprehensive education and risk-management distribution program with the objective of
providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of THALOMID   .
Internationally, THALOMID    is also distributed under mandatory risk-management
distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities  specifications to help ensure
the safe and appropriate distribution and use of THALOMID   . These programs may vary by
country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product
may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.

VIDAZA        (azacitidine for injection)   :   VIDAZA      is a pyrimidine
nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation and promote
subsequent gene re-expression. VIDAZA    was licensed from Pharmacia   Upjohn, now part
of Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, and was approved by the FDA for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS.
Additionally, VIDAZA    was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment
of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. In December 2008, VIDAZA    was granted full marketing
authorization by the EC for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic
stem cell transplantation with Intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International
Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, or CMML, with 10-29
percent marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, or AML with 20-30 percent blasts and
multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organization, or WHO, classification. In
November 2009, the TGA also granted VIDAZA    approval for the same treatment.

VIDAZA    is distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply
chain. VIDAZA    is not subjected to the same risk-management distribution programs as
THALOMID    and REVLIMID   .

RITALIN        Family of Drugs   :   In April 2000, we licensed to Novartis the worldwide
rights (excluding Canada) to FOCALIN    and FOCALIN XR   , which are approved for
the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. We retained the rights to
these products for the treatment of oncology-related disorders. We sell FOCALIN   
exclusively to Novartis and receive royalties on all of Novartis  sales of FOCALIN XR    
 and RITALIN    family of ADHD-related products. FOCALIN    is formulated
with the active d-isomer of methylphenidate and contains only the more active isomer responsible
for the effective management of the symptoms of ADHD.

ALKERAN        (melphalan)   :   ALKERAN    was licensed from GSK and sold under
the Celgene label through March 31, 2009, the conclusion date of the ALKERAN    license
with GSK. ALKERAN    was approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple
myeloma and of carcinoma of the ovary.

PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STAGE PIPELINE 

Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug candidates and cell therapies, is
highlighted by multiple classes of small molecule, orally administered therapeutic agents designed
to selectively regulate disease-associated genes and proteins. The product candidates in our
pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. Successful results in
preclinical or Phase I/II clinical studies may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety
or effectiveness of a drug or product candidate.

Phase I Clinical Trials  

Phase I human clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies allow a request to initiate
clinical investigations of a new drug or product candidate to become effective and usually
involve between 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or patients. The tests study a drug s safety
profile, and may include preliminary determination of a drug or product candidate s safe
dosage range. The Phase I clinical studies also determine how a drug is absorbed,
distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and therefore potentially the duration of
its action.

Phase II Clinical Trials  

Phase II clinical trials are conducted on a limited number of patients with the targeted
disease. An initial evaluation of the drug s effectiveness on patients is performed and
additional information on the drug s safety and dosage range is obtained.

4 

Table of Contents   

Phase III Clinical Trials  

Phase III clinical trials typically include controlled multi-center trials and involve a
larger target patient population to ensure that study results are statistically significant.
During Phase III clinical trials, physicians monitor patients to determine efficacy and to
gather further information on safety.

IMiDs            COMPOUNDS   :   IMiDs    compounds are proprietary novel
small molecule, orally available compounds that modulate the immune system and other biologically
important targets through multiple processes. The IMiDs    compound CC-4047
(pomalidomide) is being evaluated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for various disease
indications. CC-4047 is one of the most potent IMiDs    compounds that we are developing.
Our initial Investigational New Drug, or IND, application was to evaluate CC-4047 in a U.S.
proof-of-principle study in sickle cell anemia. We are also evaluating CC-4047 for treatment of
other diseases including myelofibrosis and multiple myeloma. Additional compounds are in
preclinical development. Our IMiDs    compounds are covered by an extensive and
comprehensive intellectual property estate of U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent
applications including composition-of-matter, use and other patents and patent applications.

ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS:    Our oral PDE-4 inhibitor, CC-10004 (apremilast), is a
member of a proprietary pipeline of novel small molecules with anti-inflammatory activities that
impede the production of multiple proinflammatory mediators by inhibiting PDE-4, also causing
reductions in TNF-    as well as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-17 and IL-23, interferon-gamma,
leukotrienes and nitric oxide synthase. Apremilast is our lead investigational drug in this class
of anti-inflammatory compounds and a current Phase II clinical trial for psoriasis and psoriatic
arthritis has exhibited encouraging results. We are also exploring the use of CC-10004 in additional rheumatic, dermatologic and inflammatory
diseases to determine the potential of apremilast. In addition, we are investigating our next oral
PDE-4 inhibitor, CC-11050, which has completed Phase I trials, towards evaluating its safety and
efficacy in a number of inflammatory conditions and are moving forward with its development.

KINASE INHIBITORS   :   We have generated valuable intellectual property in the identification
of kinases that regulate pathways critical in inflammation and oncology. Our kinase inhibitor
platform includes inhibitors of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK, including CC-401, which has
successfully completed a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers and in AML patients to determine
safety and tolerability. No further studies with CC-401 are planned at this time as we intend to
advance our new second generation JNK inhibitors, specifically CC-930, which recently completed a
Phase Ib multiple dose study. We are also planning to investigate CC-930 in fibrotic conditions
assuming safety and tolerability continue to be acceptable.

SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER   :   Amrubicin is a third-generation fully synthetic anthracycline
molecule with potent topoisomerase II inhibition and is currently being studied as a single agent
and in combination with anti-cancer therapies for solid
tumors. In 2008, the FDA granted amrubicin orphan drug designation for the treatment of
small cell lung cancer and fast track product designation for the treatment of small cell lung
cancer after first-line chemotherapy. A drug designated as a fast track product is intended for
the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to provide
a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy which may offer a significant improvement in
safety and/or effectiveness over existing therapy.

CELLULAR THERAPIES   :   At CCT, we are researching stem cells derived from the human placenta
as well as from the umbilical cord. CCT is our state-of-the-art research and development division
dedicated to fulfilling the promise of cellular technologies by developing cutting-edge products
and therapies to significantly benefit patients. Our goal is to develop proprietary cell therapy
products for the treatment of unmet medical needs.

5 

Table of Contents   

Stem cell based therapies offer the potential to provide disease-modifying outcomes for serious
diseases which lack adequate therapy. We have developed proprietary technology for collecting,
processing and storing placental stem cells with potentially broad therapeutic applications in
cancer, auto-immune diseases, including Crohn s disease and multiple sclerosis, neurological
disorders including stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, graft-versus-host disease, or
GVHD, and other immunological / anti-inflammatory, rheumatologic and bone disorders. We have
completed enrollment into a Phase I study for our human placenta
derived cell product (PDA-001),
which is a multi-center clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn s disease
refractory to oral corticosteroids and immune suppressants.

We also maintain an IND with the FDA for a trial with human umbilical cord blood in sickle cell
anemia and an IND for human placental-derived stem cells, or HPDSC, to support a study to assess
the safety of its transplantation with umbilical cord blood obtained from fully or partially
matched related donors in subjects with certain malignant hematological diseases and non-malignant
disorders. We are continuing additional preclinical and clinical research to define further the
potential of placental-derived stem cells and to characterize other placental-derived products.

ACTIVIN INHIBITORS:    We have a collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron, and have
initiated Phase I and II clinical trials of ACE-011 for treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia in
metastatic breast cancer, metastatic bone disease and renal anemia. ACE-011 is an inhibitor of
activin, a member of the growth and differentiation factor, or GDF, family of proteins responsible
for the growth and repair of a number of systems in the body. ACE-011 acts as a decoy receptor for
activin, blocking activin s effects upon growth and repair of various tissues including bone and
red blood cells, as well as breast, ovary and other reproductive tissues.

PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY 

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. It is our policy to seek
patent protection for our inventions, and also to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing
technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive
position.

We own or have exclusively licensed over 175 issued U.S. patents. In addition, approximately 210
additional pending patent applications are owned by or exclusively licensed to us. We have a policy
to seek worldwide patent protection for our inventions and have foreign patent rights corresponding
to most of our U.S. patents.

In August 2001, we entered into an agreement, termed the  New Thalidomide Agreement,  with
EntreMed, Inc., or EntreMed, Children s Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC, and Bioventure
Investments kft relating to patents and patent applications owned by CMCC, which agreement
superceded several agreements already in place between CMCC, EntreMed and us. Pursuant to the New
Thalidomide Agreement, CMCC directly granted to us an exclusive worldwide license under the
relevant patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide. Several U.S. and European
patents have been issued to CMCC in this patent family and certain of these patents expire in 2013
and 2014. We have applied for and received Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, in
Europe relative to certain of these issued CMCC thalidomide patents. These SPCs extend the terms
of these patents relative to uses of thalidomide to 2019. Corresponding foreign patent
applications and additional U.S. patent applications are still pending.

In addition to the New Thalidomide Agreement, we entered into an agreement, entitled the  New
Analog Agreement,  with CMCC and EntreMed in December 2002, pursuant to which we have been granted
an exclusive worldwide license to certain CMCC patents and patent applications relating to
thalidomide analogs. Under the New Analog Agreement, CMCC exclusively licensed to us these patents
and patent applications, which relate to analogs, metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products
of thalidomide, and stereoisomers thereof. Under the New Analog Agreement, we are obligated to
comply with certain milestones and other obligations, including those relating to
REVLIMID    brand drug sales. The New Analog Agreement grants us control over the
prosecution and maintenance of the licensed thalidomide analog patent rights.

Our research leads us to seek patent protection for molecular targets and drug discovery
technologies, as well as therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. More specifically,
proprietary technology has been developed for use in molecular target discovery, the identification
of regulatory pathways in cells, assay design and the discovery and development of pharmaceutical
product candidates. An increasing percentage of our recent patent applications have been related
to potential product candidates or compounds. As of December 2009, included in those inventions
described above, we owned, in whole or in part, over 70 issued U.S. patents and have filed over 90
U.S. pending patent applications, including pending provisional applications, some of which are
related to sponsored or collaborative research relationships.

In addition, we pursue, where appropriate, patent term extension and patent term adjustment
strategies. For example, we have applied for and received SPCs in Europe relative to certain
in-licensed CMCC thalidomide patents. These SPCs extend the terms of these patents relative to
certain uses of thalidomide to 2019. In addition, we have applied for and received SPCs to 2022 in
Europe, and patent term extensions in Australia, relative to certain of our patents claiming
lenalidomide. In the United States, we have been granted a patent term extension of our REVLIMID   
compositions of matter patent to 2019. In the United States, we have been granted patent term
adjustment with respect to a REVLIMID    polymorph patent; this patent is presently scheduled to
expire in 2026.

Our patents are regularly subject to challenge by generic drug companies and manufacturers. See
Part I, Item 3,  Legal Proceedings.  We rely on several different types of patents to protect our
products,
including, without limitation, compound, polymorph, formulation and method of use patents. We do
not know whether any of these patents will be circumvented, invalidated or found unenforceable as a
result of challenge by generic companies or manufacturers.

CCT, our cellular therapeutics subsidiary, seeks patent protection for the collection, processing,
composition, formulation and uses of mammalian placental and umbilical cord tissue and placental
and umbilical cord stem cells, as well as cells and biomaterials derived from the placenta. As of
December 2009, CCT owned, in whole or in part, eight U.S. patents, including claims to novel cells
and cellular compositions. In addition, CCT has approximately 50 U.S. patent applications,
including pending provisional applications.

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade
secrets and obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties where it is necessary to conduct
our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including ours, can be uncertain and involve complex legal
and factual questions. In addition, the coverage sought in a patent application can be
significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Further, our competitors, including generic drug
companies regularly attack or design around patents, particularly use and formulation patents.

Consequently, we do not know whether any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications,
which have not already been allowed, will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are
issued, whether they will be dominated by third-party patent rights, whether they will provide
significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they will be circumvented,
opposed, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or infringed by others. Further, we are aware of
third-party U.S. patents that relate to the use of certain stem cell technologies and cannot be
assured as to any impact to our potential products, or guarantee that our patents or pending
applications will not be involved in, or be defeated as a result of, opposition proceedings before
a foreign patent office or any interference proceedings before the United States Patent   Trademark
Office, or PTO.

With respect to patents and patent applications we have licensed-in, there can be no assurance that
additional patents will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have licensed patent
rights, or that, if any new patents are issued, such patents will not be opposed, challenged,
invalidated, infringed or dominated or provide us with significant proprietary protection or
commercial advantage. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed
patents will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Nor can we guarantee
that these licensed patents will not be either infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others, or
that the relevant agreements will not be terminated. Any termination of the licenses granted to us
by CMCC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Because 1) patent applications filed in the United States on or before November 28, 2000 are
maintained in secrecy until patents issue, 2) patent applications filed in the United States on or
after November 29, 2000 are not published until approximately 18 months after their earliest
claimed priority date, 3) United States patent applications that are not filed outside the United
States may not publish at all until issued, and 4) publication of discoveries in the scientific or
patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, or our
licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each of the issued patents or pending
patent applications or that we, or our licensors, were the first to file patent applications for
such inventions. In the event a third party has also filed a patent for any of our inventions, we,
or our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings before the PTO to determine
priority of invention, which could result in the loss of a U.S. patent or loss of any opportunity
to secure U.S. patent protection for the invention. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to
us, such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us.

We are aware of U.S. patents that have been issued to third parties claiming subject matter
relating to the NF B pathway, including U.S. patents which could overlap with technology claimed in
some of our
owned or licensed patents or patent applications, and a U.S. patent that has been asserted against
certain pharmaceutical companies. We are also aware of third-party U.S. patents that relate to
the use of certain TNF-    inhibitors to treat inflammation or conditions such as asthma. Further,
third parties may, from time to time, assert patents claimed to relate to commercially relevant
uses of our products and should such a claim be asserted, we will vigorously and appropriately
defend against such action.

Table of Contents   

We may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing patents or we may be required to
obtain licenses to such patents. However, we do not know whether such licenses will be available
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Prosecution of patent applications and litigation to
establish the validity and scope of patents, to assert patent infringement claims against others
and to defend against patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time-consuming.
There can be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our owned or licensed patents
are challenged by one or more third parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge
will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable. An adverse outcome in such
litigation could cause us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated by such
patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on our business. If a third party is found to
have rights covering products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease using the
products or processes covered by the disputed rights, be subject to significant liabilities to such
third party and/or be required to license technologies from such third party. Also, different
countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued by different
countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by
others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent
covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the
same invention or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the
claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a
corresponding patent issued in another country. Competitors have chosen and in the future may
choose to file oppositions to patent applications, which have been deemed allowable by foreign
patent examiners. Furthermore, even if our owned or licensed patents are determined to be valid
and enforceable, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such
patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. Additionally, for these
same reasons, we cannot be sure that patents of a broader scope than ours may be issued and thereby
create freedom to operate issues. If this occurs we may need to reevaluate pursuing such
technology, which is dominated by others  patent rights, or alternatively, seek a license to
practice our own invention, whether or not patented.

We also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret technology that we seek to protect, in
part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants,
outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. There can be no
assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached,
that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets, proprietary
know-how and technological advances will not otherwise become known to others. In addition, there
can be no assurance that, despite precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain
access to our proprietary technology or that such technology will not be found to be
non-proprietary or not a trade secret.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION/EXCLUSIVITIES AFFORED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant
factor in the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and
development activities. Most, if not all, of our therapeutic products require regulatory approval
by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are
subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval
requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States,
various federal and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or impact upon the
manufacturing, testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling, storage, record-keeping and
marketing of such products. The lengthy process of
seeking required approvals, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and
regulations, requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when
obtained, may be limited in scope which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a
product may be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to
ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products or the manufacturing
or quality control procedures used in their production may result in restrictions on their
manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure by us, our suppliers
of manufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees to obtain or maintain, or any delay in
obtaining, regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our
ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit sharing payments.

Table of Contents   

The activities required before a product may be marketed in the United States begin with
preclinical testing not involving human subjects. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation
of a product candidate s chemistry and its biological activities and the conduct of animal studies
to assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate and its formulations. The
results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must be reviewed by
the FDA primarily for safety considerations before proposed clinical trials in humans can begin.

Typically, clinical trials involve a three-phase process as previously described. In some cases,
further studies (Phase IV) are required as a condition for a new drug application, or NDA, or
biologics license application, or BLA, approval, to provide additional information concerning the
drug or product. The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials, and reports of all
adverse events must be made to the agency before drug approval. After approval, we have ongoing
reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the drug, including expedited
reports for serious and unexpected adverse events. Additionally, we may have limited control over
studies conducted with our proprietary compounds or biologics if such studies are performed by
others (e.g., cooperative groups).

The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an
NDA or BLA for evaluation to determine if the product is sufficiently safe and effective for
approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing
approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the
application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. When an NDA or BLA is approved, the
NDA or BLA holder must a) employ a system for obtaining reports of experience and side effects
associated with the drug and make appropriate submissions to the FDA and b) timely advise the FDA
if any marketed product fails to adhere to specifications established by the NDA or BLA internal
manufacturing procedures.

Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug intended to
treat a  rare disease or condition  as an  orphan drug.  The term  orphan drug  can refer to
either a drug or biologic. A rare disease or condition is defined as one which affects less than
200,000 people in the United States, or which affects more than 200,000 people, but for which the
cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of
the product in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated
as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven
years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States for such drug or product containing the
active ingredient for the same indication unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of
sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the disease. However, orphan
drug status is particular to the approved indication and does not prevent another company from
seeking approval of other labeled indications. The period of orphan exclusivity is concurrent with
any patent exclusivity that relates to the drug or biologic. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for
federal income tax credits for costs associated with the drugs  development. Possible amendment of
the Orphan Drug Act by the U.S. Congress and possible reinterpretation by the FDA has been
discussed by regulators and legislators. FDA regulations reflecting certain definitions,
limitations and procedures for orphan drugs initially went into effect in January 1993 and were
amended in certain respects in 1998. Therefore, there is no assurance as to the precise scope of
protection that may be afforded by orphan drug status in the future or that the current level of
exclusivity and tax credits will
remain in effect. Moreover, even if we have an orphan drug designation for a particular use of a
drug, there can be no assurance that another company also holding orphan drug designation will not
receive approval prior to us for the same indication. If that were to happen, our applications for
that indication could not be approved until the competing company s seven-year period of
exclusivity expired. Even if we are the first to obtain approval for the orphan drug indication,
there are certain circumstances under which a competing product may be approved for the same
indication during our seven-year period of exclusivity. Further, particularly in the case of large
molecule drugs or biologics, a question can be raised whether the competing product is really the
 same drug  as that which was approved. In addition, even in cases in which two products appear to
be the same drug, the agency may approve the second product based on a showing of clinical
superiority compared to the first product. In order to increase the development and marketing of
drugs for rare disorders, regulatory bodies outside the United States have enacted regulations
similar to the Orphan Drug Act. REVLIMID      brand drug has been granted orphan medicinal
product designation by the EC for treatment of CLL following the favorable opinion of the European
Medicines Agency s, or EMA, Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.

Table of Contents   

Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s
quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDA s current Good
Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations (which are regulations established by the FDA
governing the manufacture, processing, packing, storage and testing of drugs and biologics intended
for human use). In complying with cGMP, manufacturers must devote extensive time, money and effort
in the area of production and quality control and quality assurance to maintain full technical
compliance. Manufacturing facilities and company records are subject to periodic inspections by
the FDA to ensure compliance. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with
these requirements, regulatory enforcement action may be taken by the FDA, which may include
seeking an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and recall of products
previously shipped from the facility.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, products covered by
approved NDAs or supplemental NDAs may be protected by periods of patent and/or non-patent
exclusivity. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA is generally prevented from granting
effective approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Further, NDAs submitted under 505(b)(2) of the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act may not reference data contained in the NDA for a product protected by
an effective and unexpired exclusivity. ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications are generally less
burdensome than full NDAs in that, in lieu of new clinical data, the applications rely in whole, or
in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings of the referenced approved drug in conjunction with
bridging data, typically bioequivalence data. Upon the expiration of the applicable exclusivities,
through passage of time or successful legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective approval of an
ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a previously protected NDA in a 505(b)(2)
application. Depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities, any such approval could be
limited to certain formulations and/or indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any
outstanding exclusivities. While the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the Act, provides for ANDA
and 505(b)(2) abbreviated approval pathways for drugs earlier submitted as NDAs and approved under
section 505 of the Act, there are presently no similar provisions for biologics submitted as BLAs
and approved under the Public Health Service, or PHS, Act. That is, there is currently no
abbreviated application that would permit approval of a generic or  follow-on  biologic based on
the FDA s earlier approval of another manufacturer s application under section 351 of the PHS Act.

Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions
such as warning letters, recalls or adverse publicity issued by the FDA or in legal actions such as
seizures, injunctions, fines based on the equitable remedy of disgorgement, restitution and
criminal prosecution.

Approval procedures similar to those in the United States must be undertaken in virtually every
other country comprising the market for our products before any such product can be commercialized
in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to
country and may involve additional testing. There can be no assurance that approvals will be
granted on a timely
basis or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of drug and biologics pricing is required in
most countries other than the United States. There can be no assurance that the resulting pricing
of our products would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.

COMPETITION 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in which we compete are each highly competitive and
some of the major companies within these industries have considerably greater financial,
scientific, technical and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with universities and
research institutions in the development of products and processes and in the acquisition of
technology from outside sources.

Competition in the pharmaceutical industry, and specifically in the oncology and
immune-inflammatory areas is particularly intense. Numerous pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
generic drug companies have extensive anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug discovery, development
and commercial resources. Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca PLC., Biogen Idec Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., Eisai Co., Ltd., F.Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd, Johnson and Johnson, Merck and Co., Inc., Novartis
AG, Pfizer and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. are among some of the companies researching and
developing new compounds in the oncology, inflammation and immunology fields. We, along with other
pharmaceutical brand-name makers, face the challenges brought on by generic drug manufacturers in
their pursuit of obtaining bulk quantities of certain drugs in order for them to be able to develop
similar versions of these products and be ready to market as soon as permitted.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have undergone, and are expected to continue to
undergo, rapid and significant technological change. Consolidation and competition are expected to
intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved and become more widely known. In order
to compete effectively, we will be required to continually upgrade and expand our scientific
expertise and technology, identify and retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible
and commercially viable opportunities.

Our competition will be determined in part by the indications and geographic markets for which our
products are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The relative speed with
which we develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, receive
pricing and reimbursement approvals, finalize agreements with outside contract manufacturers when
needed and market our products are critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage.
Competition among products approved for sale will include product efficacy, safety, convenience,
reliability, availability, price, third-party reimbursement and patent and non-patent exclusivity.

SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES 

From time to time we enter into strategic alliances with third parties whereby we either grant
rights to certain of our compounds in exchange for rights to receive payments, or acquire rights to
compounds owned by other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies in exchange for obligations to
make payments to the partnering companies. Payments either to or from third parties may be in the
form of cash, upfront payments, milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of
pre-determined criteria, research and development funding, product supply contracts and royalty
payments based on net product sales.

Novartis Pharma AG:   We entered into an agreement with Novartis in which we granted to Novartis an
exclusive worldwide license (excluding Canada) to develop and market FOCALIN   
(d-methylphenidate, or d   MPH) and FOCALIN XR   , the long-acting drug formulation. We
have retained the exclusive commercial rights to FOCALIN    and FOCALIN XR    for
oncology-related disorders, such as chronic fatigue associated with chemotherapy. We also granted
Novartis rights to all of its related intellectual property and patents, including formulations of
the currently marketed RITALIN LA   . We also sell FOCALIN    to Novartis and
receive royalties on sales of all of Novartis  FOCALIN XR      and RITALIN   
family of ADHD-related products.

Array BioPharma Inc.:   We have a research collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma Inc., or
Array, focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer
and inflammation. As part of this agreement, we made an upfront payment in September 2007 to Array
of $40.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expense, in return for an option
to receive exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against two of the four research
targets defined in the agreement, except for Array s limited U.S. co-promotional rights. In June
2009, we made an additional payment of $4.5 million to expand the research targets defined in the
agreement, which was also recorded as research and development expense. Array will be responsible
for all discovery and clinical development through Phase I or Phase IIa and be entitled to receive,
for each compound, potential milestone payments of approximately $200.0 million, if certain
discovery, development and regulatory milestones are achieved and $300.0 million if certain
commercial milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on net sales.

Our option will terminate upon the earlier of either a termination of the agreement, the date we
have exercised our options for compounds developed against two of the four research targets defined
in the agreement, or September 21, 2012, unless the term is extended. We may unilaterally extend
the option term for two additional one-year terms until September 21, 2014 and the parties may
mutually extend the term for two additional one-year terms until September 21, 2016. Upon exercise
of an option, the agreement will continue until we have satisfied all royalty payment obligations
to Array. Upon the expiration of the agreement, Array will grant us a fully paid-up, royalty-free
license to use certain intellectual properties of Array to market and sell the compounds and
products developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire on a product-by-product and
country-by-country basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect to each product
in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be terminated by:

(i) 
       
      us at our sole discretion, or

(ii) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or by Array for a material breach by
us, then our rights to the compounds and products developed under the agreement will revert to
Array. If the agreement is terminated by Array for a material breach by us, then we will also
grant to Array a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property controlled by
us necessary to continue the development of such compounds and products. If the agreement is
terminated by us for a material breach by Array, then, among other things, our payment obligations
under the agreement could be either reduced by 50% or terminated entirely.

PTC Therapeutics, Inc.:   In September 2007, we invested $20.0 million, of which $1.1 million
represented research and development expense, in Series F-2 Convertible Preferred Stock of PTC
Therapeutics, Inc., or PTC, and in December 2009, we invested an additional $1.5 million in Series
G Convertible Preferred Stock of PTC. In September 2007, we also entered into a separate research
and option agreement whereby PTC would perform discovery research activities. Under the agreement,
both parties could subsequently agree to advance research on certain discovery targets and enter
into a separate pre-negotiated collaboration and license agreement which would replace the original
research and option agreement.

On July 16, 2009, we and PTC agreed to advance research on one discovery target and entered into a
pre-negotiated collaboration and license agreement under which PTC is eligible to receive quarterly
research fees, as defined in the agreement, and is entitled to receive potential milestone payments
of approximately $129.0 million if certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones are
achieved. PTC will also receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales. Under the agreement, we
may transfer certain research and development activities from PTC to us and upon such transfer we
will no longer fund such quarterly research fees to PTC.

Table of Contents   

The agreement will continue until we have satisfied all royalty payment obligations to PTC. Upon
our full satisfaction of our royalty payment obligations to PTC under the agreement, the license
granted to us by PTC under the agreement will become a non-exclusive, fully paid-up,
sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use certain intellectual property of PTC to market and sell
the products developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire on a product-by-product and
country-by-country basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect to each product
in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be terminated by:

(i) 
       
      us at our sole discretion following the first anniversary of the agreement, or

(ii) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or by PTC for a material breach by us,
then all licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate. If PTC materially breaches any
of its obligations under the agreement, we can either terminate the agreement, in which case all
licenses and rights granted under the agreement are terminated, or elect to continue the agreement,
in which case all milestone obligations cease and future royalties payable by us under the
agreement will be reduced by between 50% and 70%.

Acceleron Pharma:   We have a worldwide strategic collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron,
for the joint development and commercialization of ACE-011, currently being studied for treatment
of chemotherapy-induced anemia in metastatic breast cancer, metastatic bone disease and renal
anemia. The collaboration combines both companies  resources and commitment to developing
products for the treatment of cancer and cancer-related bone loss. The agreement also includes an
option for certain discovery stage programs. Under the terms of the agreement, we and Acceleron
will jointly develop, manufacture and commercialize Acceleron s products for bone loss. We made an
upfront payment to Acceleron in February 2008 of $50.0 million, which included a $5.0 million
equity investment in Acceleron, with the remainder recorded as research and development expense.
In addition, in the event of an initial public offering of Acceleron, we will purchase a minimum of
$7.0 million of Acceleron common stock.

Acceleron will retain responsibility for initial activities, including research and development,
through the end of Phase IIa clinical trials, as well as manufacturing the clinical supplies for
these studies. In turn, we will conduct the Phase IIb and Phase III clinical studies and will
oversee the manufacture of Phase III and commercial supplies. Acceleron will pay a share of the
development expenses and is eligible to receive development, regulatory approval and sales-based
milestones of up to $510.0 million for the ACE-011 program and up to an additional $437.0 million
for each of the three discovery stage programs. The companies will co-promote the products in
North America. Acceleron will receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.

The agreement will continue until we have satisfied all royalty payment obligations to Acceleron
and we have either exercised or forfeited all of our options under the agreement. Upon our full
satisfaction of our royalty payment obligations to Acceleron under the agreement, all licenses
granted to us by Acceleron under the agreement will become fully paid-up, perpetual, non-exclusive,
irrevocable and royalty-free licenses. The agreement may expire on a product-by-product and
country-by-country basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect to each product
in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be terminated by:

(i) 
       
      us at our sole discretion, or

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y)

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or by Acceleron for a material breach
by us, then all licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate and we will also grant to
Acceleron a
non-exclusive license to certain of our intellectual property related to the compounds and
products. If the agreement is terminated by us for a material breach by Acceleron, then, among
other things, (A) the licenses granted to Acceleron under the agreement will terminate, (B) the
licenses granted to us will continue in perpetuity, (C) all future royalties payable by us under
the agreement will be reduced by 50% and (D) our obligation to make any future milestone payments
will terminate.

Cabrellis Pharmaceuticals Corp.:   As a result of our acquisition of Pharmion, we obtained an
exclusive license to develop and commercialize amrubicin in North America and Europe pursuant to a
license agreement with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd, or DSP. Pursuant to Pharmion s
acquisition of Cabrellis Pharmaceutics Corp., or Cabrellis, prior to our acquisition of Pharmion,
we will pay $12.5 million for each approval of amrubicin in an initial indication by regulatory
authorities in the United States and the European Union, or E.U., to the former shareholders of
Cabrellis. Upon approval of amrubicin for a second indication in the United States or E.U., we
will pay an additional $10.0 million for each market to the former shareholders of Cabrellis.
Under the terms of the license agreement for amrubicin, we are required to make milestone payments
of $7.0 million and $1.0 million to DSP upon regulatory approval of amrubicin in the United States
and upon receipt of the first approval in the E.U., respectively, and up to $17.5 million upon
achieving certain annual sales levels in the United States. Pursuant to the supply agreement for
amrubicin, we are to pay DSP a semiannual supply price calculated as a percentage of net sales for
a period of ten years. In September 2008, amrubicin was granted fast track product designation by
the FDA for the treatment of small cell lung cancer after first-line chemotherapy.

The amrubicin license expires on a country-by-country basis and on a product-by-product basis upon
the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the applicable product in a
given country after the issuance of marketing authorization in such country and (ii) the first day
of the first quarter for which the total number of generic product units sold in a given country
exceeds 20% of the total number of generic product units sold plus licensed product units sold in
the relevant country during the same calendar quarter.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the amrubicin license may be terminated by:

(i) 
       
      us at our sole discretion,

(ii) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy,

(iii) 
       
      DSP if we take any action to challenge the title or validity of the patents
owned by DSP, or

(iv) 
       
      DSP in the event of our change in control.

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or by DSP under circumstances described
in clauses (ii)(x) and (iii) above, then we will transfer our rights to the compounds and products
developed under the agreement to DSP and will also grant to DSP a non-exclusive, perpetual,
royalty-free license to certain intellectual property controlled by us necessary to continue the
development of such compounds and products. If the agreement is terminated by us for a material
breach by DSP, then, among other things, DSP will grant to us an exclusive, perpetual, paid-up
license to all of the intellectual property of DSP necessary to continue the development, marketing
and selling of the compounds and products subject to the agreement.

GlobeImmune, Inc.:   In September 2007, we made a $3.0 million equity investment in GlobeImmune,
Inc., or GlobeImmune. In April 2009 and May 2009, we made additional $0.1 million and $10.0
million equity investments, respectively, in GlobeImmune. In addition, we have a collaboration and
option agreement with GlobeImmune focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of
novel therapeutics in cancer. As part of this agreement, we made an upfront payment in May 2009 of
$30.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expense, to GlobeImmune in return for
the option to license compounds and products based on the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000
oncology drug candidate programs as well as oncology compounds and products resulting from future
programs controlled by GlobeImmune. GlobeImmune will be responsible for all discovery and clinical
development until we exercise our option with respect to a drug candidate program and GlobeImmune
will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments of approximately $230.0 million for the
GI-4000 program, $145.0 million for each of the GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 programs as well as
$161.0 million for each additional future program if certain development, regulatory and
sales-based milestones are achieved. GlobeImmune will also receive tiered royalties on worldwide
net sales.

Table of Contents   

Our options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate
programs will terminate if we do not exercise our respective options after delivery of certain
reports from GlobeImmune on the completed clinical trials with respect to each drug candidate
program, as set forth in the initial development plan specified in the agreement. If we do not
exercise our options with respect to any drug candidate program or future program, our option with
respect to the oncology products resulting from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune will
terminate three years after the last of the options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000
and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs terminates. Upon exercise of an option, the
agreement will continue until we have satisfied all royalty payment obligations to GlobeImmune.
Upon the expiration of the agreement, on a product by product, country by country basis,
GlobeImmune will grant us an exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free perpetual, license to use
certain intellectual properties of GlobeImmune to market and sell the compounds and products
developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire on a product-by-product and
country-by-country basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect to each product
in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be terminated by:

(i) 
       
      us at our sole discretion, or

(ii) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or by GlobeImmune for a material breach
by us, then our rights to the compounds and products developed under the agreement will revert to
GlobeImmune. If the agreement is terminated by us for a material breach by GlobeImmune, then,
among other things, our royalty payment obligations under the agreement will be reduced by 50%, our
development milestone payment obligations under the agreement will be reduced by 50% or terminated
entirely and our sales milestone payment obligations under the agreement will be terminated
entirely.

MANUFACTURING 

We own and operate an FDA approved API manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. The API
facility is used to produce REVLIMID    and THALOMID    API. We have also
contracted with third-party manufacturing service providers in order to maintain backup
manufacturing capabilities. These manufacturing service providers manufacture API in accordance
with our specifications and are required to meet the FDA s and foreign regulatory authorities  cGMP
regulations and guidelines. Our backup API manufacturing service provider is Aptuit Inc. with
respect to REVLIMID    and THALOMID   .

We own and operate an FDA approved drug product manufacturing facility in Boudry (near Neuchatel),
Switzerland to perform formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution. We
maintain backup FDA approved drug product manufacturing service providers for the manufacture of
REVLIMID    and THALOMID   . These drug product manufacturing service providers
include Penn Pharmaceutical Ltd. and Institute of Drug Technology Australia Ltd. Our packaging
service providers include Sharp Corporation for worldwide packaging and Acino Holding Ltd. for
non-U.S. packaging.

The API for VIDAZA    is supplied by Ash Stevens, Inc. We also have contract
manufacturing agreements with Baxter GmBH and Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc. for VIDAZA   
product formulation,
filling vials and packaging. Our packaging service provider for non-U.S. packaging is Catalent
Pharma Solutions.

The API for FOCALIN    and FOCALIN XR    is currently obtained from two
suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc. and Siegfried USA Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer,
Mikart, Inc., for the tableting and packaging of FOCALIN    finished product.

CCT currently operates an FDA registered facility for the recovery and storage of cord blood and
placental stem cells for LifeBankUSA   . In addition, in our Warren, New Jersey facility
we are producing PDA-001, a culture-expanded placenta-derived stem cell under cGMP to supply
clinical studies. This is a multi-purpose facility capable of supporting other products.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS 

Our international headquarters and a drug product manufacturing facility which performs
formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution are located in Boudry,
Switzerland. Our API manufacturing facility located in Zofingen, Switzerland has the capability to
produce multiple drug substances and expands our global commercial manufacturing capabilities. We
continue to expand our international regulatory, clinical and commercial infrastructure and
currently conduct our international operations in over 65 countries and regions including Europe,
Latin America, Middle East, Asia/Pacific and Canada. Aside from our international headquarters,
the office facilities we maintain in these markets are on a leased basis with terms expiring at
various dates between 2010 and 2018.

SALES AND COMMERCIALIZATION 

We have a highly trained global pharmaceutical commercial organization with considerable experience
in the pharmaceutical industry, specializing products in the areas of oncology and immunology. Our
intention is to expand and develop our sales and commercialization capabilities internally as
needed in order to support our existing products. We are also positioned to expand our sales and
marketing resources as appropriate to take advantage of product acquisition and in-licensing
opportunities, and may also consider partnering with other pharmaceutical companies on future
products with indications involving large patient populations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report are
forward-looking statements concerning our business, results of operations, economic performance and
financial condition based on our current expectations. Forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and within the meaning of Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are included, for
example, in the discussions about:

strategy;

new product discovery and development;

current or pending clinical trials;

our products  ability to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile;

actions by the FDA;

product manufacturing, including our arrangements with third party suppliers;

product introduction and sales;

royalties and contract revenues;

expenses and net income;

credit and foreign exchange risk management;

liquidity;

asset and liability risk management; and

operational and legal risks.

From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the
public, as well as oral forward-looking statements. All our forward-looking statements give our
then current expectations or forecasts of future events. None of our forward-looking statements are
guarantees of future performance, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and
assumptions. Each forward-looking statement involves risks, uncertainties and potentially
inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by
our forward-looking statement. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or
should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past
results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider
our forward-looking statements. Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

We have tried, wherever possible, to identify these forward-looking statements by using words such
as  forecast,   project,   anticipate,   plan,   strategy,   intend,   potential,   outlook, 
 target,   seek,   continue,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expect,   may,   probable, 
 should,   will  or other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things,
discussions of our future operations, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product
approvals, our strategies for growth, product development and regulatory approval, our expenses,
the impact of foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and
our financial performance and results generally. You also can identify our forward-looking
statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

Table of Contents   

We provide in this report a cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our
business under the headings  Item 1A. Risk Factors  and  Item 7. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We note these factors as permitted by
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These are factors that, individually or in
the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and
historical results. You should understand, however, that it is not possible to predict or identify
all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the factors that are noted to be a complete
discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, we disclaim and do not undertake any obligations to
update or revise publicly any of our forward-looking statements, including forward-looking
statements in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in
assumptions, or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make on
related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with
or furnished to the SEC.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered
carefully. Any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our
business, prospects, financial condition, operating results or credit ratings, which could cause
the trading price of our common stock to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks
we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we
currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect our business, our results and
operations.

We may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results which could cause our
financial results to be below expectations and cause our stock price to be volatile.  

We have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our
quarterly operating results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are
outside our control, and may result in volatility of our stock price. Future operating results
will depend on many factors, including:

demand or lack of demand for our products, including demand that adversely affects our
ability to optimize the use of our manufacturing facilities;

the introduction and pricing of products competitive with ours, including generic
competition;

developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products;

regulatory approvals for our products and pricing determinations with respect to our
products;

regulatory approvals for our and our competitor s manufacturing facilities;

timing and levels of spending for research and development, sales and marketing;

timing and levels of reimbursement from third-party payors for our products;

development or expansion of business infrastructure in new clinical and geographic
markets;

the acquisition of new products and companies;

tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;

timing and recognition of certain research and development milestones and license fees;

ability to control our costs;

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and

economic and market instability.

Table of Contents   

We remain dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary products
REVLIMID   , THALOMID    and
VIDAZA    and a significant decline in
demand for or use of these products or our other commercially available products could materially
and adversely affect our operating results.  

During the next several years, the growth of our business will be largely dependent on the
commercial success of REVLIMID   , THALOMID   , and
VIDAZA   . We cannot predict whether these or our other existing or new products will be
accepted by regulators, physicians, patients and other key opinion leaders as effective drugs with
certain advantages over existing or future therapies. We are
continuing to introduce our
products in additional international markets and to obtain approvals for additional indications
both in the United States and internationally. A delay in gaining the requisite regulatory
approvals for these markets or indications could negatively impact our growth plans and the value
of our stock.

Further, if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of our products,
physician and patient comfort with the product could be undermined, the commercial success of such
products could be adversely affected and the acceptance of our other products could be
negatively impacted. We are subject to adverse event reporting regulations that require us to
report to the FDA or similar bodies in other countries if our products are associated with a death
or serious injury. These adverse events, among others, could result in additional regulatory
controls, such as the performance of costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our
approved labeling, which could limit the indications or patient population for our products or
could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market. Similarly, the occurrence of
serious adverse events known or suspected to be related to the products could negatively impact
product sales. For example, THALOMID      is known to be toxic to the human fetus and
exposure to the drug during pregnancy could result in significant deformities in the baby.
REVLIMID      is also considered fetal toxic and there are warnings against use of
VIDAZA    in pregnant women as well. While we have restricted distribution systems for
both THALOMID      and REVLIMID       and we endeavor to educate patients regarding
the potential known adverse events including pregnancy risks, we can not ensure that all such
warnings and recommendations will be complied with or that adverse events resulting from
non-compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business.

It is necessary that our primary products achieve and maintain market acceptance as well as our
other products including ISTODAX   , FOCALIN XR    and the RITALIN   
family of drugs. A number of factors may adversely impact the degree of market acceptance of our
products, including the products  efficacy, safety and advantages, if any, over competing products,
as well as the reimbursement policies of third-party payors, such as government and private
insurance plans, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects.

Sales of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and reimbursement for our products
by governmental and other third party payors is reduced or terminated.  

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will
be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health care management
organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health
coverage insurers and other third-party payors. Generally, in Europe and other countries outside
the United States, the government-sponsored healthcare system is the primary payor of healthcare costs of patients. These health
care management organizations and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has
become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in
this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant
interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on
reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. The establishment of
limitations on patient access to our drugs, adoption of price controls, and cost-containment
measures in new jurisdictions or programs, and adoption of more restrictive policies in
jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could adversely impact our business and our
future results. If these organizations and third-party payors do not consider our products to be
cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not reimburse providers or consumers
of our products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to
sell our products on a profitable basis.

22 

Table of Contents   

Our ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United States depends in part on our
relationships with group purchasing organizations, or GPOs. Many existing and potential customers
for our products become members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts,
sometimes on an exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these
negotiated prices are made available to a GPO s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are
not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less
likely to purchase our products, and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share
compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer s products, we may be precluded from
making sales to members of the GPO for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to
renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse
effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to renew these contracts at the current or substantially similar terms. If we are
unable to keep our relationships and develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position
may suffer.

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the United States.
International operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other
market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in
Europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our
pharmaceutical and medical device products. Although we cannot predict the extent to which our
business may be affected by future cost-containment measures or other potential legislative or
regulatory developments, additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation
could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products, which
could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.

If we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products we will be unable to sell our
current products and products in development.  

Changes in law, government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of
operations. The discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, risk
evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our S.T.E.P.S.    and RevAssist   
programs), marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive
laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
the U.S. Public Health Service Act, Medicare Modernization Act, Food and Drug Administration
Amendments Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act, patent laws,
environmental laws, privacy laws and other federal and state statutes, including anti-kickback,
antitrust and false claims laws, as well as similar laws in foreign jurisdictions. Enforcement of
and changes in laws, government regulations or policies can have a significant adverse impact on
our ability to continue to commercialize our products or introduce new products to the market,
which would adversely affect our results of operations.

23 

Table of Contents   

If we or our agents, contractors or collaborators are delayed in receiving, or are unable to obtain
all, necessary governmental approvals, we will be unable to effectively market our products.

The testing, marketing and manufacturing of our products requires regulatory approval, including
approval from the FDA and, in some cases, from the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, or
governmental authorities outside of the United States that perform roles similar to those of the
FDA and EPA, including the EMA, EC, the Swissmedic, the TGA and Health Canada. Certain of our
pharmaceutical products, such as FOCALIN   , fall under the Controlled Substances Act of
1970 that requires authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, of the U.S.
Department of Justice in order to handle and distribute these products.

The regulatory approval process presents a number of risks to us, principally:

In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years, and require the
expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials can
be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory
approval;

Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process based
upon the failure of the clinical or other data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the
failure of the product to meet, a regulatory agency s requirements for safety, efficacy and
quality or, in the case of a product seeking an orphan drug indication, because another
designee received approval first or receives approval of other labeled indications;

Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency
policy, or the adoption of new regulations or legislation;

The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may significantly limit the
indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and reimbursed and may impose
significant limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and contra-indications that
could materially affect the sales and profitability of the drug;

Approved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to continuing and ongoing
review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to
adhere to manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their
manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market;

Regulatory authorities and agencies of the United States or foreign governments may
promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our existing and proposed
products, including specifically tailored risk evaluation and mitigation strategies;

Guidelines and recommendations published by various governmental and non-governmental
organizations can reduce the use of our products;

Once a product receives marketing approval, we may not market that product for broader
or different applications, and the FDA may not grant us approval with respect to separate
product applications that represent extensions of our basic technology. In addition, the
FDA may withdraw or modify existing approvals in a significant manner or promulgate
additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. The FDA
may also request that we perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our
existing or proposed products if we or others identify side effects after our products are
on the market;

Products, such as REVLIMID   , that are subject to accelerated approval can be
subject to an expedited withdrawal if the post-marketing study commitments are not
completed with due diligence, the post-marketing restrictions are not adhered to or are
shown to be inadequate to assure the safe use of the drug, or evidence demonstrates that
the drug is not shown to be safe and
effective under its conditions of use. Additionally, promotional materials for such
products are subject to enhanced surveillance, including pre-approval review of all
promotional materials used within 120 days following marketing approval and a requirement
for the submissions 30 days prior to initial dissemination of all promotional materials
disseminated after 120 days following marketing approval; and

24 

Table of Contents   

Our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, labeling and promotional activities
relating to our products as well as our post-marketing activities are regulated by the FDA,
the Federal Trade Commission, The United States Department of Justice, the DEA, state
regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory agencies and are subject to associated risks.
In addition, individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active
as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer
protection and false advertising laws. If we fail to comply with regulations regarding the
promotion and sale of our products, appropriate distribution of our products under our
restricted distribution systems, prohibition on off-label promotion and the promotion of
unapproved products, such agencies may bring enforcement actions against us that could
inhibit our commercial capabilities as well as result in significant penalties.

Other matters that may be the subject of governmental or regulatory action which could adversely
affect our business include:

changes in laws and regulations, including without limitation, patent, environmental,
privacy, health care and competition laws;

importation of prescription drugs from outside the U.S. at prices that are regulated by
the governments of various foreign countries;

additional restrictions on interactions with healthcare professionals; and

privacy restrictions that may limit our ability to share data from foreign
jurisdictions.

We collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our unrelated allogeneic and private stem cell
banking businesses. The FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research currently regulates
human tissue or cells intended for transplantation, implantation, infusion or transfer to a human
recipient under 21 CFR Parts 1270 and 1271. Part 1271 requires cell and tissue establishments to
screen and test donors, to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread
of communicable disease and to register the establishment with FDA. This part also provides for
inspection by the FDA of cell and tissue establishments. The FDA recently announced that as of
October 21, 2011, a BLA will be required to distribute cord blood for unrelated allogeneic use.
Currently, we are required to be, and are, licensed to operate in New York, New Jersey, Maryland
and California. If other states adopt similar licensing requirements, we would need to obtain such
licenses to continue operating our stem cell banking businesses. If we are delayed in receiving,
or are unable to obtain at all, necessary licenses, we will be unable to provide services in those
states and this could impact negatively on our revenues.

Our products may face competition from lower cost generic or follow-on products and providers of
these products may be able to sell them at a substantially lower cost than us.  

Generic drug manufactures are seeking to compete with our drugs and will become an important
challenge to us. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents,
protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties and to conduct our
business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, can be uncertain and involve
complex legal and factual
questions including those related to our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our
S.T.E.P.S.    and RevAssist    programs).

25 

Table of Contents   

Furthermore, even if our patent applications, or those we have licensed-in, are issued, our
competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of such patents in court, requiring
us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation. Alternatively, our competitors may be able
to design around our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative
technology. If any of our issued or licensed patents are infringed or challenged, we may not be
successful in enforcing or defending our or our licensor s intellectual property rights and
subsequently may not be able to develop or market the applicable product exclusively.

Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the  at-risk 
launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic
manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products, we can quickly lose a significant portion
of our sales of that product, which can adversely affect our business. In addition, if generic
versions of our competitors  branded products lose their market exclusivity, our patented products
may face increased competition which can adversely affect our business.

The FDA approval process allows for the approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a generic
version of our approved products upon the expiration, through passage of time or successful legal
challenge, of relevant patent or non-patent exclusivity protection. Generic manufacturers pursuing
ANDA approvals are not required to conduct costly and time-consuming clinical trials to establish
the safety and efficacy of their products; rather, they are permitted to rely on the innovator s
data regarding safety and efficacy. Thus, generic manufacturers can sell their products at prices
much lower than those charged by the innovative pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies who have
incurred substantial expenses associated with the research and development of the drug product.
Accordingly, while our products currently may retain certain regulatory and or patent exclusivity;
our products are or will be subject to ANDA applications to the FDA in light of the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The ANDA procedure includes provisions
allowing generic manufacturers to challenge the effectiveness of the innovator s patent protection
prior to the generic manufacturer actually commercializing their products the so-called  Paragraph
IV  certification procedure. In recent years, generic manufacturers have used Paragraph IV
certifications extensively to challenge the applicability of Orange Book-listed patents on a wide
array of innovative pharmaceuticals, and we expect this trend to continue and to implicate drug
products with even relatively modest revenues. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA is
generally prevented from granting effective approval of an ANDA. Upon the expiration of the
applicable exclusivities, through passage of time or successful legal challenge, the FDA may grant
effective approval of an ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a previously protected
NDA in a 505(b)(2) application. Further, upon such expiration event, the FDA may require a
generic competitor to participate in some form of risk management system which could include our
participation as well. Depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities, any such approval
could be limited to certain formulations and/or indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any
outstanding exclusivities.

If an ANDA filer or a generic manufacturer were to receive approval to sell a generic or follow-on
version of one of our products, that product would become subject to increased competition and our
revenues for that product would be adversely affected.

If
we are not able to effectively compete our business will be adversely affected.  

The pharmaceutical and biotech industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to
rapid and significant technological change. Our present and potential competitors include major
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms, including,
but not limited to:

Takeda and Johnson   Johnson, compete with REVLIMID    and THALOMID    
 in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with our compounds;

Eisai Co., Ltd., SuperGen, Inc. and Johnson   Johnson compete or may potentially compete
with VIDAZA   ;

Amgen, which potentially competes with our TNF-    and kinase inhibitors;

AstraZeneca plc, which potentially competes in clinical trials with our compounds and
TNF-    inhibitors;

Biogen Idec Inc. and Genzyme Corporation, both of which are generally developing drugs
that address the oncology and immunology markets;

Bristol Myers Squibb Co., which potentially competes in clinical trials with our
compounds and TNF-    inhibitors;

F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., which potentially competes in clinical trials with our
IMiDs    compounds and TNF-    inhibitors;

Johnson   Johnson, which potentially competes with certain of our proprietary programs,
including our oral anti-inflammatory programs;

Novartis, which potentially competes with our compounds and kinase programs; and

Pfizer, which potentially competes in clinical trials with our kinase inhibitors.

Many of these companies have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than
we do. This enables them, among other things, to make greater research and development investments
and spread their research and development costs, as well as their marketing and promotion costs,
over a broader revenue base. Our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in
obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA, and other regulatory authorities. We also experience
competition from universities and other research institutions, and in some instances, we compete
with others in acquiring technology from these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has undergone,
and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change, and we expect
competition to intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known.
The development of products, including generics, or processes by our competitors with significant
advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause the marketability of our products
to stagnate or decline.

We may be required to modify our business practices, pay fines and significant expenses or
experience losses due to governmental investigations or other litigation.  

From time to time, we may be subject to governmental investigation or litigation on a variety of
matters, including, without limitation, regulatory, intellectual property, product liability,
antitrust, consumer, commercial, securities and employment litigation and claims and other legal
proceedings that may arise from the conduct of our business as currently conducted or as conducted
in the future.

In particular, we are subject to significant product liability risks as a result of the testing of
our products in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval.

Pharmaceutical companies involved in Hatch-Waxman litigation are often subject to follow-on
lawsuits and governmental investigations, which may be costly and could result in lower-priced
generic products that are competitive with our products being introduced to the market.

27 

Table of Contents   

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we received a civil inquiry and demand from the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC requested documents and other information relating to
requests by generic companies to purchase our patented THALOMID    and REVLIMID    
 brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to believe that we have engaged in
unfair methods of competition. We continue to cooperate with the FTC s request for information.

Litigation and governmental investigations are inherently unpredictable and may:

result in rulings that are materially unfavorable to us, including a requirement that
we pay significant damages, fines or penalties or prevent us from operating our business
in a certain manner;

cause us to change our business operations to avoid perceived risks associated with
such litigation or investigations;

have an adverse affect on our reputation and the demand for our products; and

require the expenditure of significant time and resources, which may divert the
attention of our management and interfere with the pursuit of our strategic objectives.

While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be
adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible
to obtain insurance to protect against all potential risks and liabilities. If any litigation or
governmental investigation were to have a material adverse result, there could be a material impact
on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. See also Legal Proceedings
contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and complex process, and we
may be unable to commercialize any of the products we are currently developing.  

Many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of research and development and will
require the commitment of substantial financial resources, extensive research, development,
preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to being
ready for sale. This process involves a high degree of risk and takes many years. Our product
development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail for many reasons, including the
failure of the product candidate in preclinical studies; adverse patient reactions to the product
candidate or indications or other safety concerns; insufficient clinical trial data to support the
effectiveness or superiority of the product candidate; our inability to manufacture sufficient
quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and
cost-efficient manner; our failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory
approvals for the product candidate, the facilities or the process used to manufacture the product
candidate; or changes in the regulatory environment, including pricing and reimbursement, that make
development of a new product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer desirable.
Moreover, our commercially available products may require additional studies with respect to
approved indications as well as new indications pending approval.

The stem cell products that we are developing through our CCT subsidiary may represent substantial
departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional
products and therapies which are now, or may be in the future, manufactured and marketed by major
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public attitudes may be influenced by
claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe, and stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the
public or the medical community.

28 

Table of Contents   

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in conducting clinical studies, we can give no assurances
that our studies will have a positive result or that we will receive regulatory approvals for our
new products or new indications.

Manufacturing and distribution risks including a disruption at certain of our manufacturing sites
would significantly interrupt our production capabilities, which could result in significant
product delays and adversely affect our results.  

We have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our products and we have contracted with third
party manufacturers and distributors to provide API, encapsulation, finishing services packaging
and distribution services to meet our needs. These risks include the possibility that our or our
suppliers  manufacturing processes could be partially or completely disrupted by a fire, natural
disaster, terrorist attack, governmental action or military action. In the case of a disruption, we
may need to establish alternative manufacturing sources for these products. This would likely lead
to substantial production delays as we build or locate replacement facilities and seek and obtain
the necessary regulatory approvals. If this occurs, and our finished goods inventories are
insufficient to meet demand, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis, if at
all. Further, our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses
that may occur and we would have to bear the additional cost of any disruption. For these reasons,
a significant disruptive event at certain of our manufacturing facilities or sites could materially
and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to predict
market demand for our products, we may be unable to sufficiently increase production capacity to
satisfy demand or may incur costs associated with excess inventory that we manufacture.

In all the countries where we sell our products, governmental regulations exist to define standards
for manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and storing. All of our suppliers of raw
materials, contract manufacturers and distributors must comply with these regulations as
applicable. In the United States, the FDA requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk
material and all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve and
maintain compliance with the FDA s cGMP regulations and guidelines. Our failure to comply, or
failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in
sanctions being imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement,
suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products,
operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely
affect supplies of our products. In addition, before any product batch produced by our
manufacturers can be shipped, it must conform to release specifications pre-approved by regulators
for the content of the pharmaceutical product. If the operations of one or more of our
manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason, any required FDA review and approval of
the operations of an alternative supplier could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products.

If our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality, quantity or timeliness, or
do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, our ability to continue
supplying such products at a level that meets demand could be adversely affected.

We have contracted with specialty distributors, to distribute THALOMID   ,
REVLIMID    and VIDAZA    in the United States. If our distributors fail to
perform and we cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable period of time, we may
experience adverse effects to our business and results of operations.

We are continuing to establish marketing and distribution capabilities in international markets
with respect to our products. At the same time, we are in the process of obtaining necessary
governmental and regulatory approvals to sell our products in certain countries. If we have not
successfully completed and
implemented adequate marketing and distribution support services upon our receipt of such
approvals, our ability to effectively launch our products in these countries would be severely
restricted.

Table of Contents   

The consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions could increase competitive and
pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.  

We sell our pharmaceutical products in the United States primarily through wholesale distributors
and contracted pharmacies. These wholesale customers comprise a significant part of the
distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network is
continuing to undergo significant consolidation. As a result, a smaller number of large wholesale
distributors control a significant share of the market. We expect that consolidation of drug
wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers,
including us. In addition, wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through fee-for-service
arrangements, and their purchases may exceed customer demand, resulting in reduced wholesaler
purchases in later quarters. We cannot assure you that we can manage these pressures or that
wholesaler purchases will not decrease as a result of this potential excess buying.

Risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents or contractors or collaborators could
adversely affect our business or reputation.  

We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance
protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators that would
violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including without
limitation, employment, foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition and privacy laws.
Such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive
penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and
reputation.

We may face significant challenges in effectively integrating entities and businesses that we
acquire and we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from any such acquisition.  

Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of entities will depend in part upon
whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner. Our
integration of these entities involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:

demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition;

the diversion of management s attention from the management of daily operations to the
integration of operations;

failure of the acquired entity to meet or exceed our expected returns;

higher integration costs than anticipated;

failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;

difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;

difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the
assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and

difficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems,
technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards,
controls (including
internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002) and related procedures and policies.

30 

Table of Contents   

If we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses, we may experience material negative
consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our failure to attract and retain key managerial, technical, scientific, selling and marketing
personnel could adversely affect our business.  

The success of our business depends, in large part, on our continued ability to (i) attract and
retain highly qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel,
(ii) successfully integrate large numbers of new employees into our corporate culture and (iii)
develop and maintain important relationships with leading research and medical institutions and key
distributors. Competition for these types of personnel and relationships is intense.

Among other benefits, we use share-based compensation to attract and retain personnel. Share-based
compensation accounting rules require us to recognize all share-based compensation costs as
expenses. These or other factors could reduce the number of shares and options management and our
board of directors grants under our incentive plan. We cannot be sure that we will be able to
attract or retain skilled personnel or maintain key relationships, or that the costs of retaining
such personnel or maintaining such relationships will not materially increase.

We could be subject to significant liability as a result of risks associated with using hazardous
materials in our business.  

We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development, manufacturing and general business
activities. While we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with the federal, state
and local laws and regulations governing the use of these materials, we cannot be certain that
accidental injury or contamination will not occur. If an accident or environmental discharge
occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and
operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines.
This could result in substantial liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial
resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations
may increase in the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or
in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage.

Changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.  

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our
domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among
these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our
effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of
existing tax laws, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in
tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development spending, changes in accounting
standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the
outcome of examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other jurisdictions, the accuracy of
our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax assets, and changes in
overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the
above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have an impact on our results of operations.

Currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could increase our costs and may cause our
profitability to decline.  

We collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and expenditures in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating
results.

31 

Table of Contents   

We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk, but not to engage in
currency speculation. We use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions and
balance sheet exposures denominated in foreign currencies. We use derivative instruments,
including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to
movements in foreign exchange rates. The use of these derivative instruments mitigates the
exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost but may not fully offset any
change in operating results that result from fluctuations in foreign currencies. Any significant
foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

We may experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet our financial reporting
obligations.  

As we continue to expand at a rapid pace, the development of new and/or improved automated systems
will remain an ongoing priority. During this expansion period, our internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting. Such misstatements
may result in litigation and/or negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction
that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock.

The decline of global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations.  

Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on reimbursement from government health
administration authorities, private health insurers, distribution partners and other organizations.
As a result of the current global credit and financial market conditions, these organizations may
be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment. In addition, U.S.
federal and state health authorities may reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and private
insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. A reduction in the availability or extent of
reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales, revenue and cash flows.

Due to the recent tightening of global credit, there may be a disruption or delay in the
performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or collaborators. We rely on third parties
for several important aspects of our business, including portions of our product manufacturing,
royalty revenue, clinical development of future collaboration products, conduct of clinical trials
and raw materials. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our
business could be adversely affected.

The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you may lose some or all of your
investment in us.  

The market for our shares of common stock may be subject to disruptions that could cause volatility
in its price. In general, the current global economic crisis has caused substantial market
volatility and instability. Any such disruptions or continuing volatility may adversely affect the
value of our common stock. In addition to current global economic instability in general, the
following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock:

results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our marketed products;

fluctuations in our commercial and operating results;

announcements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors;

market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular;

32 

Table of Contents   

stock market conditions generally;

changes in governmental regulations and laws, including, without limitation, changes in
tax laws, health care legislation, environmental laws, competition laws, and patent laws;

new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;

public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of the disease states
that we are targeting;

patent or proprietary rights developments;

changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for our products;

the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes related to production and
formulation of those products or uses of those products;

other litigation or governmental investigations;

competition; and

investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product acquisitions.

In addition, our operations may be materially affected by conditions in the global markets and
economic conditions throughout the world, including the current global economic and market
instability. The global market and economic climate may continue to deteriorate because of many
factors beyond our control, including continued economic instability and market volatility, rising
interest rates or inflation, terrorism or political uncertainty. In the event of a continued or
future market downturn in general and/or the biotechnology sector in particular, the market price
of our common stock may be adversely affected.

A breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or
interrupt the operation of our business.  

We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. The size and
complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious
intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others who access
our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the
public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and
information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns
or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.

We have certain charter and by-law provisions that may deter a third-party from acquiring us and
may impede the stockholders  ability to remove and replace our management or board of directors.  

Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time, without further stockholder
approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the price, rights, privileges
and preferences of those shares. An issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party
from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Additionally, our board of directors
has adopted certain amendments to our by-laws intended to strengthen the board s position in the
event of a hostile takeover attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders  ability to
remove and replace our management and/or board of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to the
provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer of our common
stock.

ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

Our corporate headquarters, which is located in Summit, New Jersey on approximately 45 acres of
land, was purchased in 2004 and consists of several buildings, which house our administrative,
sales, marketing and research functions.

Our international headquarters is located in Boudry, Switzerland and includes a drug product
manufacturing facility to perform formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and
distribution. We operate an API manufacturing facility located in Zofingen, Switzerland which has
the capability to produce multiple drug substances. The facility is being used to produce
REVLIMID    and THALOMID    API to supply global markets and may also be used to
produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates.

We occupy the following facilities, located in the United States, under operating lease
arrangements that have remaining lease terms greater than one year. Under these lease
arrangements, we also are required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance,
utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. All leases are with unaffiliated parties.

78,000 square feet of office space in Basking Ridge, New Jersey with a term ending in
September 2011 at an annual cost of $1.4 million.

73,500 square feet of laboratory and office space in Warren, New Jersey. The two leases
for this facility extend through May 2012 and July 2010, respectively, and contain
five-year renewal options. Annual rent for these facilities is approximately $1.1 million.

23,500 square feet of office space in Warren, New Jersey with a term ending in September
2010 at an annual cost of $0.5 million.

34 

Table of Contents   

20,800 square feet of office and laboratory space in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey. The
lease for this facility has a term ending in October 2010 with renewal options for
additional five-year terms. Annual rent for this facility is approximately $0.3 million
and is subject to specified annual rental increases.

78,200 square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego, California. The lease
for this facility has a term ending in August 2012 with one five-year renewal option.
Annual rent for this facility is approximately $2.2 million and is subject to specified
annual rental increases.

55,900 square feet of office and research space in San Francisco, California with a term
ending in September 2016 at an annual cost of $2.4 million.

27,700 square feet of office space in Overland Park, Kansas with a term ending in May
2011 at an annual cost of $0.4 million.

We also lease a number of offices under various lease agreements in Europe, Canada and
Asia/Pacific. The minimum annual rents may be subject to specified annual rent increases. At
December 31, 2009, the non-cancelable lease terms for these operating leases expire at various
dates between 2010 and 2017 and in some cases include renewal options. The total amount of rent
expense recorded for leased facilities in 2009 was $20.5 million.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, commercial and other claims;
government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of our business.

Patent proceedings include challenges to scope, validity or enforceability of our patents relating
to our various products or processes. Although we believe we have substantial defenses to these
challenges with respect to all our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of
these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the
drug at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially
affect future results of operations.

Among the principal matters pending to which we are a party, are the following:  
THALOMID   

Barr Laboratories, Inc., or Barr, a generic drug manufacturer located in Pomona, New York,
filed an ANDA for the treatment of ENL in the manner described in our label and seeking permission
from the FDA to market a generic version of 50mg, 100mg and 200mg THALOMID   .
Barr has notified us that it merged with Teva, and Barr is now Barr Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Teva. Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic
manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a  Paragraph IV certification ) challenging the
validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book four years after the pioneer
company obtains approval of its NDA. On or after December 5, 2006, Barr mailed notices of
Paragraph IV certifications alleging that the following patents listed for THALOMID    in
the Orange Book are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,045,501 ( the
 501 patent ), 6,315,720 ( the  720 patent ), 6,561,976 ( the  976 patent ), 6,561,977 ( the  977
patent ), 6,755,784 ( the  784 patent ), 6,869,399 ( the  399 patent ), 6,908,432 ( the  432
patent ), and 7,141,018 ( the  018 patent ). The  501,  976, and  432 patents do not expire until
August 28, 2018, while the remaining patents do not expire until October 23, 2020. On January 18,
2007, we filed an infringement action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey against Barr. By
bringing
suit, we are entitled to a 30-month stay, from the date of our receipt of the Paragraph IV
certification, against the FDA s approval of a generic applicant s application to market a generic
version of THALOMID   . In June 2007, U.S. Patent No. 7,230,012, or  012 patent, was issued
to us claiming formulations of thalidomide and was then timely listed in the Orange Book. Barr
sent us a supplemental Paragraph IV certification against the  012 patent and alleged that the
claims of the  012 patent, directed to formulations which encompass THALOMID   , were
invalid. On August 23, 2007, we filed an infringement action in the U.S. District Court of New
Jersey with respect to the  012 patent. On or after October 4, 2007, Barr filed a second
supplemental notice of Paragraph IV certifications relating to the 150mg dosage strength of
THALOMID    alleging that the  501 patent,  720 patent,  976 patent,  977 patent,  784
patent,  399 patent,  432 patent and the  018 patent are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not
infringed. On November 14, 2007, we filed an infringement action in the U.S. District Court of New
Jersey against Barr which entitled us to a second 30-month stay, expiring in November 2010. All
three actions have subsequently been consolidated. We intend to enforce our patent rights. If the
ANDA is approved by the FDA, and Barr is successful in challenging our patents listed in the Orange
Book for THALOMID   , Barr would be permitted to sell a generic thalidomide product. If we
are unsuccessful in the suits and the FDA were to approve a comprehensive education and
risk-management distribution program for a generic version of thalidomide, sales of
THALOMID    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the entrance of a generic
thalidomide product, consequently reducing our revenue.

Table of Contents   

In July 2008, we and our co-plaintiff Children s Medical Center Corp., or CMCC, asserted two
Orange-Book listed patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,629,327 and 6,235,756) relating to uses of
thalidomide for the treatment of various cancers, including multiple myeloma. We filed the action
in response to Notices of Paragraph IV certification in connection with Barr s ANDA seeking
approval to market generic versions for our THALOMID    capsules. Because both of those patents were
listed in the Orange Book when Barr originally filed its ANDA (Barr originally failed to certify
under Paragraph IV against either patent), a second 30-month stay applies, and Barr s ANDA may not
receive final approval until November 2010. Barr has asserted counterclaims seeking declarations of
noninfringement, invalidity, and unenforceability. In December 2008, we and CMCC asserted a third
Orange-Book patent relating to uses of thalidomide for the treatment of various cancers, including
multiple myeloma. We filed the action in response to Notices of Paragraph IV certification in
connection with Barr s ANDA seeking approval to market generic versions for our THALOMID    capsules.
Barr has asserted counterclaims seeking declarations of noninfringement and invalidity. All
of the above thalidomide actions have been consolidated.

The parties have completed the bulk of fact discovery, and general fact discovery is now closed.
The parties expect the Court to resolve Barr s motion in February 2010. No schedule has been set
for claim construction or expert discovery. No trial date has been set.

FOCALIN    and FOCALIN XR   

On August 19, 2004, we, together with our exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement
action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., or Teva, in
response to notices of Paragraph IV certifications made by Teva in connection with the filing of an
ANDA for FOCALIN   . The notification letters from Teva contend that U.S. Patent Nos.
5,908,850, or  850 patent, and 6,355,656, or  656 patent, are invalid. After the suit was filed,
Novartis listed another patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,528,530, or  530 patent, in the Orange Book in
association with the FOCALIN    NDA. The original 2004 action asserted infringement of the
 850 patent. Teva amended its answer during discovery to contend that the  850 patent was not
infringed by the filing of its ANDA, and that the  850 patent is not enforceable due to an
allegation of inequitable conduct. Fact discovery in the original 2004 action expired on February
28, 2006. At about the time of the filing of the  850 patent infringement action, reexamination
proceedings for the  656 patent were initiated in the U.S. PTO. On September 28, 2006, the U.S.
PTO issued a Notice of Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate, and on March 27, 2007,
the Reexamination Certificate for the  656 patent issued. On December 21, 2006, we and Novartis
filed an action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey against Teva for infringement of the  656
patent.
Teva filed an amended answer and counterclaim on March 23, 2007. The amended counterclaim seeks a
declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability. The statutory
30-month stay, to which Paragraph IV certifications (including those below) are entitled to,
expired on January 9, 2007, and Teva proceeded to market with a generic version of
FOCALIN   . Plaintiffs  complaints included a request for an injunction against
future sales of Teva s generic products, as well as a claim for money damages for actual sales.
This action has been resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement dated December 9,
2009. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties sought (and the Court allowed) a 60-day
stay of the litigation, in order to allow for review of the settlement agreement by the Federal
Trade Commission and Department of Justice. The case was dismissed on February 1, 2010.

On September 14, 2007, we, together with our exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement
action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA,
Inc. in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by Teva in connection with the
filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN XR   . The notification letter from Teva contends that claims
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850 and 6,528,530 are invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed by the
proposed Teva products, and it contends that U.S. Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid
and not infringed by the proposed Teva products. We and Novartis asserted each of these patents
and additionally asserted U.S. Patent No. 6,355,656 in our complaint against Teva.
Subsequently, plaintiffs added claims for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,431,944. This
action has been resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement dated December 9, 2009.
Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties sought (and the Court allowed) a 60-day stay of
the litigation, in order to allow for review of the settlement agreement by the Federal Trade
Commission and Department of Justice. The case was dismissed on February 1, 2010.

On October 5, 2007, we, together with our exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement
action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against IntelliPharmaCeutics
Corp., or IPC, in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by IPC in connection
with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN XR   . The notification letter from IPC contends that claims
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed IPC
products. The notification letter also contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850,
6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are invalid, and that claims in U.S. Patent Nos.
5,908,850, 6,355,656 and 6,528,530 are unenforceable. In our complaint against IPC, we and
Novartis asserted U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284. IPC
filed an answer and counterclaim on November 20, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory
judgment of patent invalidity, non infringement, and unenforceability with respect to Patent Nos.
5,908,850, 6,355,656, and 6,528,530, and it seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and
non infringement with respect to Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. We and Novartis subsequently
added claims against IPC for infringement of United States patent No. 7,431,944. Fact discovery has
expired and claim construction briefing has been completed. Expert discovery has yet to be
completed. On October 23, 2009, the court administratively struck the pleadings relating to claim
construction, in order to afford the parties a chance to determine whether a settlement can be
reached. If we are unsuccessful in proving infringement or defending our patents, Novartis  sales
of FOCALIN XR    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the entrance of a generic
FOCALIN XR    product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties associated with these sales.
If settlement cannot be reached, the claim construction and other litigation proceedings will move
forward.

On November 8, 2007, we, together with our exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement
action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Actavis South Atlantic LLC
and Abrika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively,  Actavis ) in response to a notice of a Paragraph
IV certification made by Actavis in connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN XR   . The
notification letter from Actavis contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656,
5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed Actavis products, and it contends that
claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid.
In our complaint against Actavis, we and
Novartis asserted U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284.
Actavis filed an answer and counterclaim, seeking a declaratory judgment of patent
invalidity, non-infringement, and unenforceability with respect to the patents-in-suit. Plaintiffs
subsequently added claims against Actavis for infringement of U.S. Patent No.
7,431,944. Fact discovery has expired and claim construction briefing has been completed. Expert
discovery has yet to be completed. No trial date has been set. On October 23, 2009, the court
administratively struck the pleadings relating to claim construction, in order to afford the
parties a chance to determine whether a settlement can be reached. If we are unsuccessful in
proving infringement or defending our patents, Novartis  sales of FOCALIN XR    could be
significantly reduced in the United States by the entrance of a generic FOCALIN XR   
product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties associated with these sales. If
settlement cannot be reached, the claim construction and other litigation proceedings will move

RITALIN LA   

On December 4, 2006, we, together with our exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement
action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Abrika Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. and Abrika Pharmaceuticals, LLP, (collectively,  Abrika Pharmaceuticals ) in response to a
notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by Abrika Pharmaceuticals in connection with the filing
of an ANDA for RITALIN LA    20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg generic products. The notification letter from
Abrika Pharmaceuticals contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid
and are not infringed by the
proposed Abrika Pharmaceuticals products. In our complaint against Abrika Pharmaceuticals, we and
Novartis asserted U.S. Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. Abrika Pharmaceuticals filed an answer
and counterclaim in the New Jersey court on June 1, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory
judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect to the
patents-in-suit. On September 26, 2007, Abrika Pharmaceuticals sent a Paragraph IV certification to
us and Novartis in connection with the filing of an ANDA supplement with respect to Abrika
Pharmaceuticals  proposed generic 10 mg RITALIN LA    product. We and Novartis filed an amended
complaint against Abrika Pharmaceuticals on November 5, 2007 that includes infringement allegations
directed to Abrika Pharmaceuticals  proposed generic 10 mg RITALIN LA    product. Abrika
Pharmaceuticals filed an answer and counterclaim to the amended complaint on December 5, 2007. The
counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and
unenforceability with respect to the patents-in-suit. If we are unsuccessful in proving
infringement or defending our patents, Novartis  sales of RITALIN LA    could be significantly
reduced in the United States by the entrance of a generic RITALIN LA    product, consequently
reducing our revenue from royalties associated with these sales. Fact discovery has expired

OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary 

Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively  we  or  our ) is a global integrated
biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of
innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory related diseases.

Our primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID   , THALOMID    (inclusive
of Thalidomide Celgene TM  and Thalidomide Pharmion TM , subsequent to the
acquisition of Pharmion Corporation, or Pharmion) and VIDAZA   . ALKERAN    was
licensed from GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, and sold under our label through March 31, 2009, the
conclusion date of the ALKERAN    license with GSK. REVLIMID    is an oral
immunomodulatory drug marketed in the United States, Europe and Asia / Pacific for patients with
multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and in the United States, Canada and
certain countries in Latin America for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or
intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic
abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. THALOMID    is marketed
for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous
manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, an inflammatory
complication of leprosy. VIDAZA      is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown
to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re-expression.
VIDAZA    is licensed from Pfizer, and is marketed in the United States for the treatment
of all subtypes of MDS and was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of MDS through May
2011. In the third quarter of 2009, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, upgraded
VIDAZA    to a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and
high-risk MDS. In Europe, VIDAZA      is marketed for the treatment of certain qualified
adult patients and was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of MDS and acute myeloid
leukemia, or AML, in the European Union, or EU, expiring December 2018.

We continue to invest substantially in research and development, and the drug candidates in our
pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. These candidates include
our IMiDs      compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having
certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties, in addition to our leading
oral anti-inflammatory agents and cell products. We believe that continued acceptance of our
primary commercial stage products, depth of our product pipeline, regulatory approvals of both new
products and expanded use of existing products provide the catalysts for future growth.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we reported revenue of $2.690 billion, net income of $776.7
million and diluted earnings per share of $1.66. Revenue increased by $435.1 million in 2009
compared to 2008 primarily due to our continued expansion into international markets and revenue
growth of REVLIMID    and VIDAZA   , which more than offset decreases in revenues
from THALOMID    and ALKERAN   . The decrease in THALOMID    was
primarily due to lower unit volumes in the United States resulting from the increased use of
REVLIMID   , while the decrease in ALKERAN    was due to the March 31, 2009
conclusion of the ALKERAN    license with GSK. Net income and earnings per share for 2009
reflect the earnings contributions from higher REVLIMID    and VIDAZA   
revenues, partly offset by increased spending for new product launches, recurring research and
development activities and the expansion of our international operations. The year ended December
31, 2008 included a $1.740 billion charge for acquired in-process research and development, or
IPR D, related to the Pharmion acquisition in March 2008.

Factors Affecting Future Results 

Future operating results will depend on many factors, including demand for our existing products,
regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates, the timing and market acceptance of
new products launched by us or competing companies, the timing of research and development
milestones, challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs. See  Risk
Factors  contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Results of Operations   

Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 

Total Revenue:  Total revenue and related percentage changes for the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007 were as follows:

2009 compared to 2008:  Total revenue increased by $435.1 million, or 19.3%, in 2009 compared
to 2008. The revenue increase in the United States was $132.5 million, or 8.3% and the increase in
international markets was $302.6 million, or 46.3%.

2008 compared to 2007:  Total revenue increased by $849.0 million, or 60.4%, in 2008 compared to
2007. The revenue increase in the United States was $379.8 million, or 31.6% and the increase in
international markets was $469.2 million, or 230.2%.

Net Product Sales: 

2009 compared to 2008:  Net product sales increased by $429.7 million, or 20.1% to $2.567 billion
in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $428.0 million and
price increases of $61.5 million, partly offset by a decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange
of $59.8 million.

REVLIMID    net sales increased by $381.8 million, or 28.8% to $1.706 billion in 2009
compared to 2008 primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets.
Increased market penetration and the increase in duration of therapy and number of patients using
REVLIMID    in multiple myeloma contributed to U.S. growth. The growth in international
markets reflects the expansion of our commercial activities in over 65 countries and product
reimbursement approvals.

44 

Table of Contents   

THALOMID    net sales decreased by $67.8 million, or 13.4%, to $436.9 million in 2009
compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower unit volumes in the United States
resulting from the increased use of REVLIMID   , partially offset by higher pricing and
volume increases in international markets.

VIDAZA      net sales increased by $180.5 million, or 87.3%, to $387.2 million in 2009
compared to 2008 primarily due to the December 2008 full marketing authorization granted by the
European Commission,
or EC, for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell
transplantation with Intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic
System Score, or IPSS, or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, or CMML, with 10-29 percent marrow
blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, or AML with 20-30 percent blasts and multi-lineage
dysplasia, according to World Health Organization, or WHO, classification of VIDAZA   .
In addition, sales for 2008 only included sales subsequent to the March 7, 2008 acquisition of
Pharmion.

ALKERAN    net sales decreased by $61.6 million to $20.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008.
This product was licensed from GSK and sold under our label through March 31, 2009, the conclusion
date of the ALKERAN    license with GSK.

2008 compared to 2007:  Net product sales increased by $837.2 million, or 64.4% to $2.138 billion
in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $742.8 million, as
well as price increases of $93.0 million, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.4
million.

REVLIMID    net sales increased by $550.8 million, or 71.2%, to $1.325 billion in 2008
compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales in the United States and continued expansion in
international markets. Increased market penetration and the increase in duration of patients using
REVLIMID    in multiple myeloma accounted for most of the U.S. growth. International
sales growth primarily reflects the impact of the June 2007 EC s approval for the use of
REVLIMID    for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple
myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and continued expansion in international
markets.

THALOMID    net sales increased by $57.6 million, or 12.9%, to $504.7 million in 2008
compared to 2007 primarily due to the 2008 inclusion of international sales, resulting from the
acquisition of Pharmion. In addition, U.S. price increases were offset by lower sales volumes.

VIDAZA      net sales of $206.7 million represented sales recorded subsequent to the March
7, 2008 Pharmion acquisition in both the United States and international markets.

ALKERAN      net sales increased by $8.2 million, or 11.1%, to $81.7 million in 2008
compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in unit sales of the injectable form.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals:  We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and
allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and distributor service fees.

THALOMID    is distributed in the United States under our S.T.E.P.S.    program
which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive education and risk-management distribution
program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of
THALOMID   . Internationally, THALOMID    is also distributed under mandatory
risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities  specifications
to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of THALOMID   . These
programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management
program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. REVLIMID    is
distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the
RevAssist    program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution program tailored
specifically to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID   .

more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain. VIDAZA    is not subjected to the
same risk-management distribution programs as THALOMID    and REVLIMID   .

We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured
end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors,
such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory
centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable.
If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future
returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination
is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track
actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer
eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on
open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with
historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in
determining the current sales return allowance. THALOMID    is drop-shipped directly to
the prescribing pharmacy and, as a result, wholesalers do not stock the product.
REVLIMID    is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, lending
itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting
in lower returns activity to date.

Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.

Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for
purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals
are based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization
applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare
Services. Certain international markets have government-sponsored programs that require rebates to
be paid based on program specific rules and accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined
primarily on estimated eligible sales.

Chargebacks accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by
wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under
federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be
paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. On January 28, 2008, the Fiscal Year 2008
National Defense Authorization Act was enacted, which expands TRICARE to include prescription drugs
dispensed by TRICARE retail network pharmacies. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S.
Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military
personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals reflect this program
expansion and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE
rebate formula.

See Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of
gross to net sales accruals.

Table of Contents   

Gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

2009 compared to 2008 : Returns and allowances decreased by $5.9 million in 2009 compared to
2008 primarily due to the completion of an inventory centralization and rationalization initiative
conducted by a major pharmacy chain during 2009, decreased revenue from products with a higher
return rate history in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in ALKERAN    returns due to
the March 31, 2009 conclusion of the ALKERAN    license with GSK. In addition, 2008
includes an increase in THALOMID    returns resulting from the anticipated increase in the
use of REVLIMID    in multiple myeloma.

Discounts increased by $1.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to revenue increases in
the United States and international markets, both of which offer different discount programs.

Government rebates increased by $12.6 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to increased
sales levels of REVLIMID    and VIDAZA    in the United States and international
markets, as well as reimbursement approvals in new markets.

Chargebacks and distributor service fees decreased by $11.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008
primarily due to reduced revenue from products with a higher chargeback history in 2009 compared to
2008 and a decrease in ALKERAN    chargebacks, partially offset by an increase in
international distributor service fees due to certain programs commenced in 2009.

2008 compared to 2007 : Returns and allowances decreased by $19.2 million in 2008 compared 2007
primarily due to reduced THALOMID    inventory in the sales channel resulting from the
2007 THALOMID    inventory centralization and rationalization at several major pharmacy
chains, which also resulted in additional returns during 2007. In addition, 2007 includes an
increase in THALOMID    returns resulting from the anticipated increase in use of
REVLIMID    in multiple myeloma.

Discounts increased by $8.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of
REVLIMID      as well as the inclusion of former Pharmion products, which resulted in
additional discounts taken.

47 

Table of Contents   

Government rebates increased by $7.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased
international government rebates resulting from our global expansion, as well as the inclusion of
former Pharmion products.

Chargebacks and distributor service fees increased by $30.1 million in 2008 compared to 2007
primarily due to the new TRICARE rebate program, as well as the inclusion of former Pharmion
products.

Collaborative Agreements and Other Revenue: 

2009 compared to 2008:  Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources decreased by $1.2
million to $13.7 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the
elimination of license fees and amortization of deferred revenues related to Pharmion subsequent to
the March 7, 2008 acquisition and was partly offset by an increase in milestone payments received
in 2009.

2008 compared to 2007:  Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources totaled $14.9
million and $20.1 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $5.2 million decrease in 2008
compared to 2007 was primarily due to the elimination of license fees and amortization of deferred
revenues related to Pharmion.

Royalty Revenue: 

2009 compared to 2008:  Royalty revenue increased by $6.6 million to $108.8 million in 2009
compared to 2008 due to the 2009 inclusion of $9.0 million in residual ALKERAN    payments
earned by us based upon GSK s ALKERAN    revenues subsequent to the conclusion of the
ALKERAN    license with GSK. Royalty revenue related to Novartis  sales of RITALIN    
 decreased by $2.1 million from 2008.

2008 compared to 2007:  Royalty revenue totaled $102.2 million in 2008, representing an increase of
$16.9 million compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to amounts received from Novartis
on sales of FOCALIN XR   , partly due to patients transitioning from FOCALIN   
to FOCALIN XR   . We sell FOCALIN    to Novartis and receive royalties on sales
of Novartis  FOCALIN XR   .

Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets):  Cost of goods sold
and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

2009 compared to 2008 : Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible
assets) decreased by $42.0 million to $216.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008 partly due to the
March 31, 2009 conclusion date of the ALKERAN    license with GSK, reducing cost of goods
sold by approximately $39.0 million compared to 2008. In addition, costs related to
THALOMID      decreased as a result of lower unit volumes. Finally, 2008 included a
$24.6 million inventory step-up adjustment related to the March 7, 2008 acquisition of Pharmion
compared to an adjustment of $0.4 million included in 2009. The impact of these reductions was
partly offset by higher costs related to increased unit volumes for REVLIMID      and
VIDAZA     . As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding
amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 8.4% in 2009 from 12.1% in 2008 primarily
due to lower ALKERAN    sales, which carried a higher cost to sales ratio relative to our
other products, and the decrease in the inventory step-up adjustment.

48 

Table of Contents   

2008 compared to 2007 : Cost of goods sold increased by $128.1 million in 2008 compared to 2007
primarily due to the inclusion of costs related to VIDAZA      and
THALOMID     , which were obtained in the Pharmion acquisition. Also included in 2008
is $24.6 million of the $25.0 million of inventory step-up cost related to the acquisition date
fair value of former Pharmion inventories. Cost of sales also increased due to an increase in
material costs for ALKERAN      for injection and an increase in unit volume for
REVLIMID     , resulting in higher royalties. As a percent of net product sales, cost
of goods sold increased to 12.1% in the 2008 from 10.0% in 2007 primarily due to the inclusion of
higher costs for VIDAZA      and ALKERAN      and the $24.6 million of
inventory step-up cost.

Research and Development:  Research and development expenses and related percentages for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

2009 compared to 2008 : Research and development expenses decreased by $136.4 million in 2009
compared to 2008 primarily due to a $303.1 million charge included in 2008 for a royalty obligation
payment to Pfizer that related to the unapproved forms of VIDAZA      partly offset by
2009 spending increases related to drug discovery and clinical research and development in support
of multiple programs across a broad range of diseases. Included in 2009 were upfront payments of
$30.0 million and $4.5 million to GlobeImmune, Inc. and Array BioPharma, Inc., respectively,
related to research and development collaboration agreements. Included in 2008 was an upfront
payment of $45.0 million made to Acceleron Pharma, Inc. related to a research and development
collaboration agreement.

The following table provides an additional breakdown of research and development expenses:

Other pharmaceutical programs for 2009 includes $34.5 million for the GlobeImmune, Inc. and
Array BioPharma, Inc., or Array, research and development collaboration agreements noted above in
addition to spending for toxicology, analytical research and development, quality and regulatory
affairs. Other pharmaceutical programs for 2008 includes the $303.1 million
VIDAZA      royalty obligation payment, $45.0 million for the Acceleron Pharma, Inc.,
or Acceleron, research and development collaboration agreement noted above, in addition to spending
for toxicology, analytical research and development, quality and regulatory affairs.

49 

Table of Contents   

Research and development expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary
development programs for REVLIMID      and other IMiDs     
compounds; VIDAZA     ; amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer;
apremilast (CC-10004), our lead anti-inflammatory compound that
inhibits PDE-4, which results in the inhibition of multiple proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-   
and which is currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials in the treatment of psoriasis
and psoriatic arthritis; pomalidomide, which is currently being evaluated in Phase I and II
clinical trials; CC-11050, for which Phase II clinical trials are planned; our kinase and ligase
inhibitor programs; as well as the placental stem cell program. In June 2009, we filed a New Drug
Application, or NDA, with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, for
REVLIMID      in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with
multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. REVLIMID      had
previously been granted orphan drug status by the MHLW in Japan for this same indication.

Research and development expense may continue to grow as earlier stage compounds are moved through
the preclinical and clinical stages. Due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties
inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and
development projects, the cost to complete such projects can vary. The data obtained from these
tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent a
project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development, which would significantly
impact the costs incurred to bring a project to completion.

For information about the commercial and development status and target diseases of our drug
compounds, refer to the product overview table contained in Part I, Item I,  Business,  of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2008 compared to 2007 : Research and development expenses increased by $530.8 million in 2008
compared to 2007, primarily due to a $303.1 million charge for the October 3, 2008 royalty
obligation payment to Pfizer that related to the unapproved forms of VIDAZA     .
Clinical program spending increased by $147.4 million in support of ongoing multiple proprietary
development programs. Regulatory spending increased by $20.2 million primarily due to the
expansion of REVLIMID      in international markets and costs related to apremilast.
Also included in 2008 was $45.0 million in upfront payments made to Acceleron related to a research
and development collaboration arrangement. The increase was partly offset by the 2007 inclusion of
a combined $41.1 million in upfront payments for collaborative research and development
arrangements for early stage compounds with Array and PTC Therapeutics.

Selling, General and Administrative:  Selling, general and administrative expenses and related
percentages for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

2009 compared to 2008:  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $68.3
million to $753.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting increases in marketing and
sales related expenses of $75.1 million, which were partly offset by a $6.7 million reduction in
bad debt expense and other customer account charges. Marketing and sales related expenses in 2009
included product launch activities for REVLIMID     , VIDAZA      and THALOMID    in Europe, Canada and Australia, in
addition to VIDAZA      relaunch expenses in the United States upon receipt of an
expanded FDA approval to reflect new overall survival data. The increase in expense also reflects
the continued expansion of our international commercial activities.

50 

Table of Contents   

2008 compared to 2007:  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $244.6 million in
2008 compared to 2007, primarily reflecting an increase in marketing and sales related expenses of
$167.5 million, general and administrative expenses of $63.8 million and an increase in donations
to non-profit foundations that assist patients with their co-payments of $13.3 million. The
increase reflects marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities for
REVLIMID      and THALOMID    in Europe, Canada and Australia, in addition to
the activities related to the relaunch of VIDAZA      in the United States and new
launches in Europe.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets:  Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased
by $20.6 million to $83.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to several intangible
assets obtained in the Pharmion acquisition in March 2008 becoming fully amortized during the
fourth quarter of 2008 and third quarter of 2009.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development:  The $1.74 billion IPR D charge in 2008 represents
the fair value of compounds under development by Pharmion at the date of acquisition that had not
yet achieved regulatory approval for marketing in certain markets or had not yet been completed and
have no alternative future use. These intangibles primarily related to development and approval
initiatives for VIDAZA      IV in the EU market, the oral form of azacitidine in the
U.S. and EU markets and THALOMID    in the EU market.

Interest and investment income, net:  The following table provides a summary of interest and
investment income, net for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Interest and investment income decreased by $8.1 million to $76.8 million in 2009 compared to
2008 primarily due to reduced yields on invested balances, partly offset by higher invested
balances.

Interest and investment income decreased by $25.0 million to $84.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007
primarily due to lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting
from the March 2008 cash payment of $746.8 million related to the Pharmion acquisition and the
October 3, 2008 payment of $425.0 million to Pfizer where we prepaid our royalty obligation under
the June 7, 2001 5-azacytidine license in full, in addition to reduced yields on invested balances.
Interest and investment income, net included other-than-temporary impairment losses on marketable
securities available for sale totaling $2.4 million in 2008 and $5.5 million in 2007.

51 

Table of Contents   

Equity in losses of affiliated companies:  Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded
losses of $1.1 million, $9.7 million and $4.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Included in 2008 were impairment losses of $6.0 million which were based on an evaluation of
several factors, including an other-than-temporary decrease in fair value of an equity
investment below our cost.

Interest expense : Interest expense was $2.0 million, $4.4 million and $11.1 million in 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively. The $2.4 million decrease in expense in 2009 compared to 2008 and the $6.7
million expense decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 were primarily due to the June 2008 completion of
convertible debt conversions related to our $400 million convertible notes issued on June 3, 2003
and the completion of amortization of their debt issuance costs.

Other income (expense), net:  Other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

Other income increased by $35.7 million to $60.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily
due to transaction exchange gains and net gains on foreign currency forward contracts that have not
been designated as hedges entered into in order to offset net foreign exchange gains and losses.
In addition, 2008 included an impairment loss of $4.1 million.

Other income increased by $27.1 million to $24.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to
favorable foreign exchange rates, which was partly offset by an other-than-temporary impairment
loss recorded on an equity investment. The $2.4 million expense in 2007 included expenses related
to a termination benefit resulting from the modification of certain outstanding stock options of a
terminated employee and was partly offset by foreign exchange gains.

Income tax provision :

2009 compared to 2008:  The income tax provision increased by $34.2 million to $199.0 million in
2009 compared to 2008. The 2009 effective tax rate of 20.4% reflects the impact from our low tax
Swiss manufacturing operations and our overall global mix of income. The income tax provision
included a $17.0 million net tax benefit, which was primarily the result of filing 2008 income tax
returns with certain items being more favorable than originally estimated, reduction in a valuation
allowance related to capital loss carryforwards and the settlement of tax examinations, partially
offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to certain ongoing income tax audits.

2008 compared to 2007:  The income tax provision decreased by $125.7 million to $164.8 million in
2008 compared to 2007. The effective tax rate of negative 12% reflects non-deductible IPR D
charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of Pharmion. The effective tax rate, excluding
the impact of IPR D and the expense related to the prepayment of our royalty obligation for
unapproved products, was 24.8%, which reflects the benefit of our low tax Swiss manufacturing
operations and our overall global mix of income.

52 

Table of Contents   

Net income (loss):  Net income (loss) and per common share amounts for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

(1) 
       
      In computing diluted earnings per share for 2007, the numerator has been adjusted to add back the after-tax amount of
interest expense recognized in the year on our convertible debt. No adjustment to the numerator or denominator was made
in 2008 due to the anti-dilutive effect of any potential common stock as a result of our net loss. As of their maturity date,
June 1, 2008, substantially all of our convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock.

2009 compared to 2008:  Net income for 2009 reflects the earnings impact from higher sales of
REVLIMID      and VIDAZA     , which was partly due to sales increases in the United
States and our continued expansion into new international markets and the granting of full
marketing authorization by the EC of VIDAZA      for specified treatment of adult patients.
The earnings generated from increased sales were partly offset by increased R D spending, the
costs related to new product launches and our ongoing expansion of international operations. Net
loss for 2008 included $1.74 billion in IPR D charges related to our acquisition of Pharmion and a
$303.1 million charge for the October 2008 royalty obligation payment to Pfizer related to
unapproved forms of VIDAZA     .

2008 compared to 2007:  Net income decreased by $1.76 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily
due to $1.74 billion in IPR D charges and $102.3 million in acquired intangibles amortization
related to the acquisition of Pharmion in March 2008, in addition to a $303.1 million charge for
the October 2008 royalty obligation payment to Pfizer related to the unapproved forms of
VIDAZA     . These costs were partly offset by an increase in net revenues provided by
REVLIMID      and VIDAZA     .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

53 

Table of Contents   

Operating Activities:  Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 increased by $727.7
million to $909.9 million as compared to 2008. The increase in net cash provided by operating
activities was primarily attributable to:

higher net income,

timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and

Also see discussion of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and working capital below.

Investing Activities:  Net cash used in investing activities in 2009 increased by $333.8 million to
$856.1 million as compared to 2008. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was
primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities available for sale of $749.3
million in 2009 compared to net proceeds from net sales of marketable securities available for sale
of $312.1 million in 2008, partly offset by the $746.8 million of cash paid to acquire Pharmion in
2008.

Capital expenditures made in 2009, 2008 and 2007 related primarily to the expansion of our
manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities, as well as spending on computer and
laboratory equipment to accommodate our business growth. In 2009, capital expenditures included the
cost of developing an enhanced risk management system and in 2008, capital expenditures included
the cost of implementing the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite, or EBS. In 2007, capital
expenditures included the cost of building our international headquarters in Boudry, Switzerland
and computer equipment. For 2010, we are forecasting capital expenditures in the range of
approximately $140 million to $150 million compared to approximately $93.4 million in 2009, and we
expect to fund this with our operating cash flows.

Financing Activities:  Net cash used in financing activities was $61.9 million in 2009 compared to
net cash provided by financing activities of $281.6 million in 2008. The increase in net cash used
in financing activities compared to net cash provided by financing activities was primarily
attributable to:

a decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants in
2009 and

a decrease in the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements in 2009.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and working capital : Working capital and cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as
follows:

(1) 
       
      Includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory and other
current assets, less accounts payable, accrued expenses, income taxes payable and other current liabilities.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available for Sale:  We invest our excess cash
primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored
agency fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed fixed rate
securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt,
non-U.S. government issued securities and non-U.S. government guaranteed securities. All liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as
cash equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than three months from the date of
purchase are classified as marketable securities available for sale. We determine the appropriate
classification of our investments in marketable debt and equity securities at the time of purchase.
The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale at the end of
2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to increased cash generated from operations, which more
than offset the cash paid out under our share repurchase program announced in April 2009 and
capital expenditures.

54 

Table of Contents   

Accounts Receivable, Net : Accounts receivable, net increased by $126.4 million to $438.6 million
in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to increased sales of REVLIMID      and
VIDAZA     . Days of sales outstanding, or DSO, in 2009 amounted to 56 days compared to 42
days in 2008. The DSO increase was primarily due to increased international sales for which the
collection period is longer than for U.S. sales. We expect this trend to continue as our
international sales continue to expand.

Inventory : Inventory balances increased by $0.5 million to $100.7 million in 2009 compared to
2008. The increase reflected higher levels of REVLIMID      and VIDAZA     
inventories, which were mostly offset by the elimination of ALKERAN      inventories
resulting from the conclusion of the GSK supply agreement and reductions in THALOMID     
due to lower sales volumes.

Other Current Assets : Other current assets increased by $68.5 million to $258.9 million in 2009
compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in the fair value of foreign currency forward
derivative contracts and an increase in prepaid expenses, primarily sales, use and value added
taxes.

Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities : Accounts payable, accrued
expenses and other current liabilities decreased by $28.7 million to $446.0 million in 2009
compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the fair value of
foreign currency forward derivative contracts, which was partly offset by an increase in clinical
trial accruals and accrued payroll related expenses, resulting from our expanded business
activities.

Income Taxes Payable (Current and Non-Current) : Income taxes payable increased $59.5 million in
2009 compared to 2008 primarily from the current provision for income taxes of $225.9 million
partially offset by tax payments of $60.0 million and a tax benefit on stock option exercises of
$103.4 million.

We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly those related to research and product
development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, international expansion, commercialization of
products and capital investments. However, we anticipate that existing cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities available for sale, combined with cash received from expected net product
sales and royalty agreements, will provide sufficient capital resources to fund our operations for
the foreseeable future.

Contractual Obligations 

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009:

Operating leases:  We lease office and research facilities under various operating lease agreements
in the United States and various international markets. The non-cancelable lease terms for the
operating leases expire at various dates between 2010 and 2018 and include renewal options. In
general, we are also required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities,
maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases. For more information on the
major facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements refer to Part I, Item 2,  Properties  of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

55 

Table of Contents   

Manufacturing Facility Note Payable : In December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility
and certain other assets and liabilities from Siegfried located in Zofingen, Switzerland. At
December 31, 2009, the fair value of our note payable to Siegfried approximated the carrying value
of the note of $25.0 million.

Other Contract Commitments : Other contract commitments include $146.2 million in contractual
obligations related to product supply contracts. In addition, we have committed to invest $20.0
million in an investment fund over a ten-year period, which is callable at any time. On December
31, 2009, our remaining investment commitment was $10.5 million. For more information refer to
Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Income Taxes Payable:  We have provided a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to
various federal, state and foreign income tax matters of $450.2 million at December 31, 2009 of
which $27.8 million is classified as current. The remaining balance of $422.4 million is classified
as non-current because the timing of the settlement of these amounts is not reasonably estimable as
of December 31, 2009. We do not expect a settlement of the unrecognized tax benefits classified as
non-current within the next 12 months.

Collaboration Arrangements:  We have entered into certain research and development collaboration
arrangements with third parties that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and
commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the
achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and /or commercial targets. See Note 17
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on 10-K for a description
of our collaboration agreements. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued
involvement in the programs, the successful development of research compounds that we choose to
license and/or the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the programs.

The table of contractual obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include potential
milestone payments totaling approximately $3.750 billion, which are either contingent on the
achievement of various research, development and regulatory approval milestones (approximately
$2.220 billion) or are sales-based milestones (approximately $1.530 billion). Research,
development and regulatory approval milestones depend primarily upon future favorable clinical
developments and regulatory agency actions, neither of which may ever occur. Sales-based
milestones are contingent on generating certain levels of future sales of products. Since the
achievement and timing of these milestones is neither determinable nor reasonably estimable, such
contingencies have not been included in the contractual obligations table or recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets.

New Accounting Principles 

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, established the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification TM , or ASC, as the source of authoritative accounting principles
recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. All
other accounting literature not included in the ASC is now nonauthoritative. The ASC was effective
for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 and
its adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ASC is updated
through the FASB s issuance of Accounting Standard Updates, or ASUs. Summarized below are recently
issued accounting pronouncements as described under the new ASC structure.

In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC No. 825,  Fair Value Measurements,  or ASC 825, which
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. The FASB partially deferred the effective date of ASC 825 for non-financial assets
and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
nonrecurring basis to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Our adoption of ASC 825
related to non-financial assets beginning January 1, 2009 did not have any impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified ASC No. 808,  Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related
to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property,  or ASC 808, which provides
guidance for ASC No. 730,  Research and Development,  related to how the parties to a collaborative
agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties, how
sharing payments pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the income statement
and certain related disclosure requirements. The guidance for ASC 808 was effective for us
beginning January 1, 2009 on a retrospective basis and did not have any impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC No. 805,  Business Combinations,  or ASC 805, which requires
an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date,
with limited exceptions. This Statement also requires the capitalization of research and
development assets acquired in a business combination at their acquisition date fair values,
separately from goodwill. In addition, ASC 805 requires that any post-acquisition adjustments to
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions be
recognized in current period income tax expense. ASC 805 was effective for us beginning January 1,
2009 and we accounted for post-acquisition tax-related adjustments for pre-2009 business
combinations and will account for future business combinations and certain other developments from
past combinations in accordance with its provisions.

In December 2007, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 810,  Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements,  which changes the accounting for and reporting of
noncontrolling interests (formerly known as minority interests) in consolidated financial
statements. The amendment was effective for us beginning January 1, 2009 and did not have any
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 815,  Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,  which is intended to improve financial reporting about
derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors
to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position, financial performance and
cash flows. The amendment was effective for us beginning January 1, 2009 and the expanded
disclosures are included in Note 6.

In April 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 350,  Determination of the Useful Life of
Intangible Assets,  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or
extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The
amendment was effective for us beginning January 1, 2009 and did not have any impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 470  Accounting for Convertible Debt
Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement),  which
requires separate accounting for the debt and equity components of convertible debt issuances that
have a cash settlement feature permitting settlement partially or fully in cash upon conversion. A
component of such debt issuances that is representative of the approximate fair value of the
conversion feature at inception should be bifurcated and recorded to equity, with the resulting
debt discount amortized to interest expense in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible,
unsecured debt borrowing rate. The requirements for separate accounting must be applied
retrospectively to previously issued convertible debt issuances as well as prospectively to newly
issued convertible debt issuances, negatively affecting both net income and earnings per share, in
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Since our past
convertible debt issuance did not include a cash settlement feature, the amendment did not have any
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents   

In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC No. 260,  Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities,  or ASC 260. The ASC addresses whether
instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to
vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per
share under the two-class method and requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment
awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as a separate class of
securities in calculating earnings per share. ASC 260 was effective for us beginning January 1,
2009. Since our past share-based payment awards did not include non-forfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents, the adoption of ASC 260 did not have any impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified ASC No. 323,  Equity Method Investment Accounting
Considerations,  or ASC 323, which clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment
considerations involving equity method investments. ASC 323 was effective for us beginning January
1, 2009 and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified an amendment to ASC No. 350,  Accounting for Defensive
Intangible Assets,  which clarifies the accounting for certain separately identifiable intangible
assets which an acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its
competitors from obtaining access to them. The amendment requires an acquirer in a business
combination to account for a defensive intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting, which
should be amortized to expense over the period the asset diminishes in value. The amendment was
effective for us beginning January 1, 2009 and we will account for defensive intangible assets
acquired in future business combinations in accordance with its provisions.

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 820,  Determining Fair Value When the Volume
and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying
Transactions That Are Not Orderly,  or ASC 820. This amendment provides additional guidance for
estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820 when the volume and level of activity for the
asset or liability have significantly decreased and also includes guidance on identifying
circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly for fair value measurements. This
amendment shall be applied prospectively with retrospective application not permitted. This
amendment was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 320,  Recognition and Presentation of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.  This amendment was issued to make the other-than-temporary
impairments guidance more operational and to improve the presentation of other-than-temporary
impairments in the financial statements. This amendment replaces the existing requirement that the
entity s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired debt security
until recovery with a requirement that management assert it does not have the intent to sell the
security, and it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of
its cost basis. This amendment provides increased disclosure about the credit and noncredit
components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold and also requires increased
and more frequent disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses and an aging of
securities with unrealized losses. Although this amendment does not result in a change in the
carrying amount of debt securities, it does require that the portion of an other-than-temporary
impairment not related to a credit loss for a held-to-maturity security be recognized in a new
category of other comprehensive income and be amortized over the remaining life of the debt
security as an increase in the carrying value of the security. This amendment was effective for
interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this amendment did not have
any impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 825,  Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of
Financial Instruments,  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not
measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as well as in annual
financial statements. Prior to this amendment, fair values for these assets and liabilities were
only disclosed annually. This amendment applies to all financial instruments within the scope of
ASC 825 and requires all entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This amendment was effective for interim periods
ending after June 15, 2009. This amendment does not require disclosures for earlier periods
presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption. In periods after initial adoption, this
amendment requires comparative disclosures only. The adoption did not have any impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 805,  Accounting for Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies.  This amendment
clarifies application issues associated with initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in
a business combination. This amendment was effective for us beginning January 1, 2009 and we will
account for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies acquired in future business
combinations in accordance with its provisions.

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC No. 855,  Subsequent Events,  or ASC 855, which established
general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet
date but before financial statements are issued. It sets forth the period after the balance sheet
date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that
occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under
which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in
its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or
transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. ASC 855 was effective for financial
statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 860,  Accounting for Transfers of Financial
Assets,  which eliminates the concept of a  qualifying special-purpose entity,  changes the
requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional disclosures. This
amendment clarifies the determination whether a transferor and all of the entities included in the
transferor s financial statements being presented have surrendered control over transferred
financial assets. It also enhances information reported to users of financial statements by
providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a company s continuing
involvement in transferred financial assets. This amendment will be effective for our fiscal year
beginning January 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of
this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 810,  Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,  which changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized
or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination
of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an
entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that
most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. This amendment requires ongoing
reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and
will require a company to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable
interest entities, any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement and how its
involvement with a variable interest entity affects the company s financial statements. This
amendment will be effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010. We are currently
evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on our consolidated
financial statements.

Table of Contents   

In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05,  Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,  or ASU
2009-05, which amends ASC 820 to provide clarification of a circumstances in which a quoted price
in an active market for an identical liability is not available. A reporting entity is required to
measure fair value using one or more of the following methods: 1) a valuation technique that uses
a) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b) quoted prices for
similar liabilities (or similar liabilities when traded as assets) and/or 2) a valuation technique
that is consistent with the principles of ASC 820. ASU 2009-05 also clarifies that when estimating
the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs
relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability. The adoption of this ASU did
not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-12,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,  or
ASU 2009-12, which provides additional guidance on using the net asset value per share, provided by
an investee, when estimating the fair value of an alternate investment that does not have a readily
determinable fair value and enhances the disclosures concerning these investments. ASU 2009-12 was
effective for our interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2009.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13,  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,  or
ASU 2009-13, which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently
within the scope of ASC 605. This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value
of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based
upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other
means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. ASU 2009-13 is effective for us
prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning January 1,
2011. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this amendment will
have on our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies 

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, we believe
the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical:

Revenue Recognition:  Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss
of the product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for discounts, early payments, rebates,
sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in
the same period the related sales are recorded. We record estimated reductions to revenue for
volume-based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to
revenue for such volume-based discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms, historical
experience and trend analysis.

We recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees  sales of our products or products using our
technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when
royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured. If
royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectibility of a royalty amount is not reasonably
assured, royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals:  We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and
allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and distributor service fees.

THALOMID      is distributed in the United States under our S.T.E.P.S.      program
which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive education and risk-management distribution
program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of
THALOMID     . Internationally, THALOMID      is also distributed under mandatory
risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities  specifications
to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of THALOMID     . These
programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management
program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. REVLIMID      is
distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the
RevAssist      program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution program tailored
specifically to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID     .
Internationally, REVLIMID      is also distributed under mandatory risk-management
distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities  specifications to help ensure
the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID     . These programs may vary by
country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product
may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. VIDAZA      is distributed through the
more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain. VIDAZA      is not subjected to the
same risk-management distribution programs as THALOMID      and REVLIMID     .

We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured
end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors,
such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory
centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable.
If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future
returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination
is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track
actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer
eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on
open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with
historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in
determining the current sales return allowance. THALOMID      is drop-shipped directly to
the prescribing pharmacy and, as a result, wholesalers do not stock the product.
REVLIMID      is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, lending
itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting
in lower returns activity to date.

Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.

Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for
purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals
are based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization
applied to the Medicaid unit rebate amount formula established by the Center for Medicaid and
Medicare Services. Certain international markets have government-sponsored programs that require
rebates to be paid and accordingly the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated
eligible sales.

Chargebacks are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers
and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified
programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the
wholesale distributor for services provided. On January 28, 2008, the Fiscal Year 2008 National
Defense Authorization Act was enacted, which expands TRICARE to include prescription drugs
dispensed by TRICARE retail network pharmacies. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S.
Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military
personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals reflect this program
expansion and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE
rebate formula.

Income Taxes : We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision
for income taxes. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among
multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these
estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and
subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the IRS and other taxing authorities, as
well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. If our
estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially
impacted.

61 

Table of Contents   

We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the
carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a
portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future
realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing
jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax
reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment
is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would have
to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. At December 31, 2009, it was
more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.

Share-Based Compensation : The cost of share-based compensation is recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations based on the fair value of all awards granted, using the Black-Scholes
method of valuation. The fair value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is
recognized over the service period required to obtain full vesting. Compensation cost to be
recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into
consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Available-For-Sale Marketable Securities:  A decline in the
market value of any available-for-sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be
other-than-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is
charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established. The determination of
whether an available-for-sale marketable security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires
significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence
in evaluating the potential impairment. Factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired include: significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings
performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the issuer, adverse changes in the
general market conditions in which the issuer operates, length of time that the fair value has been
below our cost, our expected future cash flows from the security, our intent not to sell and an
evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery
of our cost basis. Assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and
economic conditions, which could differ from our assessment.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities:  All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet
at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period
in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative
instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging
transaction. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period,
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item.
We assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether the derivative instruments that are
used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows
of hedged items. We assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss
related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if any, to current earnings. If we
determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge
accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in
current earnings. We use derivative instruments, including those not designated as part of a
hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. The use of
these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our
risk or cost. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes and are not a
party to leveraged derivatives.

Investment in Affiliated Companies:  We apply the equity method of accounting to our investments in
common stock of affiliated companies and certain investment funds, which primarily invest in
companies conducting business in life sciences such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical
technology, medical devices, diagnostics and health and wellness.

Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment. If an investment s fair
value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be
other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is
judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances. Factors considered in determining
whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit price
of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the
investee; length of time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition and
business prospects of the investee; our intent and ability to retain the investment for a
sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues that
raise concerns about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern; and any other
information that we may be aware of related to the investment.

Accounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans : We have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or
LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with performance-based incentive
opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives
covering a three-year period. We currently have three three-year performance cycles running
concurrently ending December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Performance measures for each LTIP are
based on the following components in the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP
earnings per share, 25% on non-GAAP net income and 50% on total non-GAAP revenue, as defined.

Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participant s salary for the plans. Awards are
payable in cash or, at our discretion, in our common stock based upon our stock price at the payout
date. We accrue the long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end of
a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the
cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to
their target award, or an award based on actual performance, if higher, through the date of the
change in control.

Accruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions concerning future non-GAAP
earnings per share, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP revenues, as defined; the actual results of
which could be materially different than the assumptions used. Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed
on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated
estimates of future payouts. In estimating the accruals, management considers actual results to
date for the performance period, expected results for the remainder of the performance period,
operating trends, product development, pricing and competition.

Valuation of acquired intangible assets and acquired in-process research and development:  We have
acquired intangible assets primarily through business combinations. When identifiable intangible
assets, including in-process research and development, are acquired we determine the fair values of
these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these
valuations, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but
not limited to:

projecting regulatory approvals,

estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and
in-process projects and

developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair
value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method of
accounting and is not amortized, but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a
triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. We test our goodwill annually
for impairment each November 30. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to
their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if
certain events occur. We currently have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from
adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the
likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.

We have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to
maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified
depending on market conditions. Although investments may be subject to credit risk, our investment
policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit
exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment. At December 31, 2009, our market
risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale, our manufacturing
facility note payable and certain foreign currency forward contracts.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale:  At December 31, 2009, our marketable securities
available for sale consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
fixed rate securities, FDIC guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt, non-U.S. government issued fixed
rate securities, non-U.S. government guaranteed fixed rate securities and a marketable equity
security. U.S. government-sponsored agency securities include general unsecured obligations of the
issuing agency, including issues from the Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, Federal National
Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac.
U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities include fixed rate asset-backed
securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Government National Mortgage Association, or
Ginnie Mae. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, guaranteed corporate debt includes
obligations of bank holding companies that meet certain criteria set forth under the Federal
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, or TLGP, and is unconditionally guaranteed by the FDIC.

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHLB and Ginnie Mae are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency,
or FHFA. Working with the Congress and the Office of the President, the U.S. Treasury and the
Federal Reserve have pledged to continue to provide capital and liquidity to these U.S.
government-sponsored agencies. We have not recorded any impairment against our holdings in these
securities due to the support of the U.S. government of these agencies.

Non-U.S. government issued securities consist of direct obligations of highly-rated governments of
nations other then the United States. Non-U.S. government guaranteed securities consist of
obligations of agencies and other entities that are explicitly guaranteed by highly-rated
governments of nations other then the United States. We have not recorded impairments against our
holdings in these securities due to the support of the governments of these agencies and entities.

Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value, held for an unspecified period
of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a
separate component of stockholders  equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is adjusted
for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with
realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges, is included in interest and
investment income, net.

As of December 31, 2009, the principal amounts, fair values and related weighted average interest
rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available-for-sale
were as follows:

Note Payable:  In December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and certain other
assets and liabilities from Siegfried. At December 31, 2009, the fair value of our note payable to
Siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note of $25.0 million (See Note 11 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report). Assuming other factors are
held constant, an increase in interest rates generally will result in a decrease in the fair value
of the note. The note is denominated in Swiss francs and its fair value will also be affected by
changes in the U.S. dollar / Swiss franc exchange rate. The carrying value of the note reflects
the U.S. dollar / Swiss franc exchange rate and Swiss interest rates.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:  We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific
forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign
currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in anticipated foreign
currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily associated
with non-functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The
foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008 had settlement
dates within 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow
hedges under ASC 815 and, accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or losses on
them are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, and reclassified to operations in
the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect operations. Any
ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other income, net.
Foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as
follows:

The notional settlement amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $1.107 billion and $704.2 million, respectively. We consider the
impact of our own and the counterparties  credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as
the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract. As of December 31, 2009
and 2008, credit risk did not materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward
contracts.

66 

Table of Contents   

We recognized reductions in net product sales for certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of
$36.4 million for 2009 and $0.4 million for 2008. These settlements were recorded in the same
period as the related forecasted sales occurred. We recognized an increase in research and
development expenses for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of $0.6
million for 2009 and a decrease in research and development expenses for the settlement of certain
effective cash flow hedge instruments of $4.0 million for 2008. These settlements were recorded in
the same period as the related forecasted research and development expenses occurred. We recognized
an increase in other income, net for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge
instruments of $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These settlements were recorded
in the same period as the related forecasted expenses occurred. Changes in time value, which we
excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, were included in other income, net.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency
fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These
foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges under ASC 815 and,
accordingly, any changes in their fair value are recognized in other income, net in the current
period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency forward non-designated hedging
contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $483.2 million and $56.6 million,
respectively.

Although not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 10% threshold reflects a reasonably
possible near-term change in foreign currency rates. Assuming that the December 31, 2009 exchange
rates were to change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair value of the foreign currency forward
contracts would change by approximately $154.1 million. However, since the contracts either hedge
specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies or hedge assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities  functional currencies, any change in
the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and
reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect
earnings or remeasured through earnings each period along with the underlying hedged item.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Celgene Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders  equity for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2009. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited the consolidated financial statement schedule,  Schedule
II   Valuation and Qualifying Accounts.  These consolidated financial statements and consolidated
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has, as of January
1, 2009, changed its method of accounting for business combinations, as of January 1, 2008, changed
its method of accounting for the measurement of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities,
and, as of January 1, 2007, changed its method of recognizing and measuring the tax effects related
to uncertain tax positions, each due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 18, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.

1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation:  Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries
(collectively  Celgene  or the  Company ) is a global integrated biopharmaceutical company
primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies
designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases.

The Company s primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID   , THALOMID   
(inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene TM  and Thalidomide Pharmion TM , subsequent to
the acquisition of Pharmion Corporation, or Pharmion), VIDAZA    and FOCALIN   .
FOCALIN    is sold exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. The Company also
derives revenues from a licensing agreement with Novartis, which entitles it to royalties on
FOCALIN XR    and the entire RITALIN    family of drugs, and sales of
bio-therapeutic products and services through the Company s Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary.
ALKERAN    was licensed from GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, and sold under the Celgene label
through March 31, 2009, the conclusion date of the ALKERAN    license with GSK. For the
ensuing two years, the Company will continue to earn residual payments based upon GSK s
ALKERAN    revenues.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celgene Corporation and its
subsidiaries. Investments in limited partnerships and interests where the Company has an equity
interest of 50% or less and does not otherwise have a controlling financial interest are accounted
for by either the equity or cost method. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year s presentation.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties related to product
development, regulatory approval, market acceptance, scope of patent and proprietary rights,
intense competition, rapid technological change and product liability.

In January 2010, the Company acquired Gloucester Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Gloucester, a privately
held pharmaceutical company, for $340.0 million in cash plus $300.0 million in contingent U.S. and
international regulatory milestone payments. The acquisition is expected to advance the Company s
leadership position in the development of disease-altering therapies through innovative approaches
for patients with rare and debilitating blood cancers. Gloucester
developed ISTODAX    (romidepsin), which was approved in November 2009 by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, in patients who
have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Additionally, ISTODAX    has received
both orphan drug designation for the treatment of non-Hodgkin s T-cell lymphomas, which includes
CTCL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, and Fast Track status in PTCL from the FDA. The
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) has granted orphan status
designation for ISTODAX    for the treatment of both CTCL and PTCL. Due to the
limitations on access to Gloucester information prior to the acquisition date and the
limited time since the acquisition date, the initial accounting for the business combination is
incomplete at this time. As a result, the Company is unable to provide the contingent
consideration disclosures and amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for the major classes
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the information required for pre-acquisition
contingencies and goodwill.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Financial Instruments:  Certain financial instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
(e.g., cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other assets, accounts payable and
certain other liabilities) are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their
short-term nature. The fair values of financial instruments other than marketable securities are
determined through a combination of management estimates and information obtained from third
parties using the latest market data. The fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities is
determined utilizing the valuation techniques appropriate to the type of security (See Note 5).

Derivative Instruments and Hedges:  All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet
at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period
in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative
instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging
transaction. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period,
the Company formally documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and
hedged item. The Company assesses, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether the
derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company assesses hedge ineffectiveness
on a quarterly basis and records the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative
instruments, if any, to current earnings. If the Company determines that a forecasted transaction
is no longer probable of occurring, it discontinues hedge accounting and any related unrealized
gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. The Company uses
derivative instruments, including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction, to manage
its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. The use of these derivative instruments
modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the Company s risk or cost. The
Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes and is not a party to
leveraged derivatives.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available for Sale:  The Company invests its
excess cash primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
fixed rate securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, guaranteed fixed rate
corporate debt, non-U.S. government issued securities and non-U.S. government guaranteed
securities. All liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of
purchase are classified as cash equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than
three months from date of purchase are classified as marketable securities available for sale. The
Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt and equity
securities at the time of purchase. Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair
value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting the Company s
ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, which are
deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders  equity, net of tax.
The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to
maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary
impairment charges, is included in interest and investment income, net.

A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below its carrying value that is
determined to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to earnings and decrease in the
security s carrying value down to its newly established fair value. Factors evaluated to determine
if an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in earnings
performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the issuer; adverse changes in
the general market condition in which the issuer operates; the Company s intent not to sell and an
evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell before
recovery of its cost basis; and issues that raise concerns about the issuer s ability to continue
as a going concern.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Concentration of Credit Risk:  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk. The Company
invests its excess cash primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed fixed rate
securities and FDIC guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt, non-U.S. government issued securities and
non-U.S. government guaranteed securities (See Note 7). The Company may also invest in unrated or
below investment grade securities, such as equity in private companies. The Company has
established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity.
These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified to take advantage of trends in
yields and interest rates.

The Company sells its products in the United States primarily through wholesale distributors and
contracted pharmacies. Therefore, wholesale distributors and large pharmacy chains account for a
large portion of the Company s U.S. trade receivables and net product revenues (See Note 20).
International sales are primarily made directly to hospitals, clinics and retail chains. The
Company continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and has internal policies
regarding customer credit limits. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts
primarily based on the credit worthiness of its customers, aging of receivable balances and general
economic conditions.

Inventory:  Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a
first-in, first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews the composition of inventory in order
to identify obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise non-saleable items. If non-saleable items are
observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory, the Company will record a write-down to
net realizable value in the period that the decline in value is first recognized. Included in
inventory are raw materials used in the production of preclinical and clinical products, which are
charged to research and development expense when consumed.

Property, Plant and Equipment:  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation of plant and equipment is recorded using the straight-line method.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the economic useful life of the asset or
the remaining term of the lease, including anticipated renewal options. The estimated useful lives
of plant and equipment are as follows:

Buildings

40 years 

Building and operating equipment

15 years 

Manufacturing machinery and equipment

10 years 

Other machinery and equipment

5 years 

Furniture and fixtures

5 years 

Computer equipment and software

3-7 years 

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred, while expenditures for improvements
which extend the life of an asset are capitalized.

Investment in Affiliated Companies:  The Company applies the equity method of accounting to its
investments in common stock of affiliated companies and certain investment funds, which primarily
invest in companies conducting business in life sciences such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals,
medical technology, medical devices, diagnostics and health and wellness.

Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment. If an investment s fair
value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be
other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is
judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances. Factors considered in determining
whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit price
of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the
investee; length of time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition and
business prospects of the investee; the Company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a
sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues that
raise concerns about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern; any other information
that the Company may be aware of related to the investment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair
value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method of
accounting and is not amortized, but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a
triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. The Company tests its goodwill
annually for impairment each November 30. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are
amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for
impairment if certain events occur as described in  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  below. The
Company currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the assets exceed their estimated future
undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of would be
separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities
of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate
asset and liability sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Foreign Currency Translation:  Operations in non-U.S. entities are recorded in the functional
currency of each entity. For financial reporting purposes, the functional currency of an entity is
determined by a review of the source of an entity s most predominant cash flows. The results of
operations for non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities are translated from functional
currencies into U. S. dollars using the average currency rate during each period, which
approximates the results that would be obtained using actual currency rates on the dates of
individual transactions. Assets and liabilities are translated using currency rates at the end of
the period. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of the Company s
foreign entities into the U.S. dollar are excluded from the determination of net income and are
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are
recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company
had net foreign exchange gains of $54.5 million, $4.7 million, and $1.1 million in 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively.

Research and Development Costs:  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These
include all internal costs, external costs related to services contracted by the Company. Upfront
and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development
collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the
remaining useful life of the related product.

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Income Taxes:  The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a
deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the benefit of an uncertain tax
position that it has taken or expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax position
is more likely than not to be sustained.

Revenue Recognition:  Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss
of the product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for discounts, early payments, rebates,
sales returns and
distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period
the related sales are recorded. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for free goods
and volume-based discounts at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue
for such free goods and volume-based discounts are based on the sales terms, historical experience
and trend analysis. The cost of free goods is included in Cost of Goods Sold (excluding
amortization of acquired intangible assets).

The Company bases its sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories,
measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other
factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory
centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains. If the
historical data used by the Company to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future
returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination
is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, the
Company tracks actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots
no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience.
Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared
with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in
determining the current sales return allowance.

The Company recognizes revenue from royalties based on licensees  sales of its products or products
using its technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms
when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured.
If royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectibility of a royalty amount is not reasonably
assured, royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received.

Share-Based Compensation:  The cost of share-based compensation is recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations based on the fair value of all awards granted, using the Black-Scholes
method of valuation. The fair value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is
recognized over the service period required to obtain full vesting. Compensation cost to be
recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into
consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience.

Earnings Per Share:  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
is computed by dividing net income adjusted to add back the after-tax amount of interest recognized
in the period associated with any convertible debt issuance that may be dilutive by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include all
additional common shares that would have been outstanding as if the outstanding convertible debt
was converted into shares of common stock and assuming potentially dilutive common shares,
resulting from option exercises, restricted stock units, warrants and other incentives had been
issued and any proceeds thereof used to repurchase common stock at the average market price during
the period. The assumed proceeds used to repurchase common stock is the sum of the amount to be
paid to the Company upon exercise of options, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future
services and not yet recognized and, if applicable, the amount of excess income tax benefit that
would be credited to paid-in capital upon exercise. As of their maturity date, June 1, 2008,
substantially all of the Company s convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Comprehensive Income:  The components of comprehensive income (loss) consist of net income (loss),
changes in pension liability, changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities
classified as available-for-sale, net unrealized gains (losses) related to cash flow hedges and
changes in foreign currency translation adjustments.

A summary of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, is summarized as follows:

Capitalized Software Costs:  The Company capitalizes software costs incurred in connection
with developing or obtaining software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant
and equipment, net and are amortized over their estimated useful life of three to seven years from
the date the systems are ready for their intended use.

New Accounting Principles:  In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification TM , or ASC, as the source of
authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental
entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. All other accounting literature not included in the ASC is now
nonauthoritative. The ASC was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual
periods ending after September 15, 2009 and its adoption did not have any impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. The ASC is updated through the FASB s issuance of Accounting
Standard Updates, or ASUs. Summarized below are recently issued accounting pronouncements as
described under the new ASC structure.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC No. 805,  Business Combinations,  or ASC 805, which requires
an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date,
with limited exceptions. This Statement also requires the capitalization of research and
development assets acquired in a business combination at their acquisition date fair values,
separately from goodwill. In addition, ASC 805 requires that any post-acquisition adjustments to
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions be
recognized in current period income tax expense. ASC 805 was effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2009. The Company accounted for post-acquisition tax-related adjustments for pre-2009
business combinations and will account for future business combinations in accordance with its
provisions.

In March 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 815,  Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,  or ASC 815, which is intended to improve financial reporting
about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable
investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. The amendment was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009
and the expanded disclosures are included in Note 6.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

In November 2008, the FASB ratified an amendment to ASC No. 350,  Accounting for Defensive
Intangible Assets,  which clarifies the accounting for certain separately identifiable intangible
assets which an acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its
competitors from obtaining access to them. The amendment requires an acquirer in a business
combination to account for a defensive intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting, which
should be amortized to expense over the period the asset diminishes in value. The amendment was
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009 and the Company will account for defensive
intangible assets acquired in future business combinations in accordance with its provisions.

In April 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 805,  Accounting for Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies.  This amendment
clarifies application issues associated with initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in
a business combination. This amendment was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009 and
the Company will account for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies acquired in future
business combinations in accordance with its provisions.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC No. 860,  Accounting for Transfers of Financial
Assets,  which eliminates the concept of a  qualifying special-purpose entity,  changes the
requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional disclosures. This
amendment clarifies the determination whether a transferor and all of the entities included in the
transferor s financial statements being presented have surrendered control over transferred
financial assets. It also enhances information reported to users of financial statements by
providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a company s continuing
involvement in transferred financial assets. This amendment will be effective for the Company s
fiscal year beginning after January 1, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if
any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 810,  Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,  which changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized
or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination
of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an
entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that
most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. This amendment requires ongoing
reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and
will require a company to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable
interest entities, any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement and how its
involvement with a variable interest entity affects the company s financial statements. This
amendment will be effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on its
consolidated financial statements.

In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-12,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,  or
ASU 2009-12, which provides additional guidance on using the net asset value per share, provided by
an investee, when estimating the fair value of an alternate investment that does not have a readily
determinable fair value and enhances the disclosures concerning these investments. ASU 2009-12 was
effective for the Company s interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2009.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13,  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,  or
ASU 2009-13, which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently
within the scope of ASC 605. This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value
of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based
upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other
means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. ASU 2009-13 is effective for the
Company prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning
January 1, 2011. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this
amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.

2. Acquisition of Pharmion Corporation 

On March 7, 2008, Celgene acquired all of the outstanding common stock and stock options of
Pharmion in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations. Celgene paid a combination of $920.8 million in cash and approximately 30.8 million
shares of Celgene
common stock valued at $1.749 billion to Pharmion shareholders. The operating results of Pharmion
are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

The 2008 acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations and the allocation of the purchase price paid resulted in goodwill of $556.4 million,
developed product rights of $509.7 million and an in-process research and development charge of
$1.740 billion.

The following table provides unaudited pro forma financial information for 2008 as if the
acquisition of Pharmion had occurred as of the beginning of the period presented. For the year
presented, the unaudited pro forma results include the nonrecurring charge for in-process research
and development, or IPR D, amortization of acquired intangible assets, elimination of expense and
income related to pre-acquisition agreements with Pharmion, reduced interest and investment income
attributable to cash paid for the acquisition and the amortization of the inventory step-up to fair
value of acquired Pharmion product inventories. The unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any
operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that may result from the combined operations of
Celgene and Pharmion. Accordingly, these unaudited pro forma results are presented for
illustrative purposes and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of
operations of the combined company that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred at
the beginning of the period presented, nor are they intended to represent or be indicative of
future results of operations.

Prior to the acquisition, Celgene had licensed exclusive rights relating to the development
and commercial use of THALOMID    and its distribution system to Pharmion, and
also maintained a THALOMID    supply agreement with Pharmion. The effective
settlement of these arrangements resulted in no settlement gain or loss as the contractual terms
were deemed to be at market rates due to several factors including, but not limited to, the
continued absence of European marketing authorization for THALOMID    since the
agreements were executed by unrelated entities in December 2004, the review of similar recent
agreements entered into by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies containing similar economic
terms and the lack of a termination penalty for either party to the agreements. In addition, the
Company has valued the reacquired THALOMID   -related rights when valuing the
developed product rights acquired. Any assets and liabilities that existed between Celgene and
Pharmion as of the acquisition date have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

3. Restructuring 

The March 7, 2008 acquisition cost of Pharmion included $58.6 million in restructuring liabilities
primarily related to the planned exit of certain business activities, involuntary terminations and
the relocation of certain Pharmion employees. Payments totaling $31.0 million were made in 2008.
The remaining balance of these restructuring liabilities totaled $27.6 million and $2.6 million as
of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The following table summarizes changes
to the restructuring liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2009:

(1)  
       
      In 2009, the Company amended two manufacturing contracts on terms other than those that had been expected. These
adjustments were credited to goodwill.

4.  
       
       Earnings per Share (EPS) 

The total number of potential common shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share
computation because the exercise price of the stock options exceeded the average price of the
Company s common stock was 23,337,108, 14,563,880 and 7,018,350 shares in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

83 

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

For the year ended December 31, 2008, an additional 19,762,916 of potential common shares were
excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation because their effect was anti-dilutive as a
result of the Company s 2008 net loss.

5. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurement 

The table below presents information about assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 with the valuation techniques the
Company utilized to determine such fair value, as required since accounting pronouncement revisions
adopted by the Company in 2008. Fair values determined based on Level 1 inputs utilize quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company s Level 1
assets consist of marketable equity securities. Fair values determined based on Level 2 inputs
utilize observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and
observable quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not very active. The
Company s Level 2 assets consist primarily of U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
fixed rate obligations, FDIC guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt, non-U.S. government issued fixed
rate securities, non-U.S. government guaranteed fixed rate securities and forward currency
contracts. Fair values determined based on Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable inputs and include
valuations of assets or liabilities for which there is little, if any, market activity. The
Company s Level 3 securities at December 31, 2009 consisted of warrants for the purchase of equity
securities in a non-publicly traded company in which the Company has invested and which is party to
a collaboration and option agreement with the Company.

The Company s Level 3 assets at December 31, 2008 consisted of a private cash fund with a carrying
value calculated pursuant to the amortized cost method, which values each investment at its
acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accumulation of discount over the
investment s remaining life, net of impairment.

6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:  Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the enhanced
disclosure requirement required under ASC 815 for derivative instruments and hedging activities by
providing additional information about its objectives for using derivative instruments, the level
of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related
hedged items affect its financial position and performance. Since the enhanced disclosure
requirements under ASC 815 require only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging
activities, the adoption did not affect the presentation of the Company s financial position or
results of operations.

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions
denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of
certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in
anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
primarily associated with non-functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign
subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 and
2008 had settlement dates within 24 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are
designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815 and, accordingly, to the extent effective, any
unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, and
reclassified to operations in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions
affect operations. Any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in
other income, net. Foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and
expenses were as follows:

The Company considers the impact of its own and the counterparties  credit risk on the fair
value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the
contract on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, credit risk did not materially
change the fair value of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts.

85 

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign
currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. These foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges and,
accordingly, any changes in their fair value are recognized in other income, net in the current
period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency forward non-designated hedging
contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $483.2 million and $56.6 million,
respectively.

instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008:

7. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available-for-Sale 

Money market funds of $860.9 million and $691.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, were recorded at cost, which approximates fair value and are included in cash and
cash equivalents.

The amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses and estimated
fair value of available-for-sale securities by major security type and class of security at
December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

88 

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

U.S. government-sponsored agency securities include general unsecured obligations of the
issuing agency. U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, include fixed rate
asset-backed securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation and the Government National Mortgage Association. FDIC guaranteed corporate
debt includes obligations of bank holding companies that meet certain criteria set forth under the
Temporary Liquidity Guaranty Program and are unconditionally guaranteed by the FDIC. Non-U.S.
government issued securities consist of direct obligations of highly-rated governments of nations
other then the United States. Non-U.S. government guaranteed securities consist of obligations of
agencies and other entities that are explicitly guaranteed by highly-rated governments of nations
other then the United States. Net unrealized gains in U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
fixed rate obligations and FDIC guaranteed corporate fixed rate debt primarily reflect the impact
of decreased interest rates at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The fair value of available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2009
was as follows:

The Company believes that the decline in fair value of securities held at December 31, 2009
below their cost is temporary and intends to retain its investment in these securities for a
sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of these investments. During
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company determined that certain securities had
sustained an other-than-temporary impairment partly due to a reduction in future estimated cash
flows and an adverse change in an investee s business operations. The Company recognized
impairment losses of $6.5 million and $5.5 million, respectively, in those years which were
recorded in interest and investment income, net.

Duration periods of available-for-sale debt securities were as follows at December 31, 2009:

10. Investment in Affiliated Companies 

At December 31, 2009, the Company held 10,364,864 shares of EntreMed, Inc., or EntreMed, common
stock, representing an ownership interest of approximately 11.8% in EntreMed. The Company also
holds 3,350,000 shares of EntreMed voting preferred shares that are convertible into 16,750,000
shares of common stock and determined that it has the ability to exercise significant influence
over EntreMed and therefore applies the equity method of accounting to its common stock investment.
The Company also owns an interest in two limited partnership investment funds to which it applies
the equity method of accounting.

A summary of the Company s equity investment in affiliated companies follows:

Additional equity method investments totaling $3.6 million and $12.9 million were made during 2009
and 2008, respectively. Affiliated losses for 2008 included other-than-temporary impairment losses
of $6.0 million. These impairment losses were based on an evaluation of several factors, including
a decrease in fair value of the equity investment below its cost.

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Notes Payable:  The Company has a note payable to Siegfried Ltd. and Siegfried Dienste AG
(referred to here together as  Siegfried ) with a present value of approximately $25.0 million and
$26.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The remaining payments on the note are
4.1 million Swiss Francs payable in each of 2010 and 2011 and 4.0 million Swiss Francs payable in
each of the subsequent five years. Amounts due within one-year at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
$4.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively, and were included in other current liabilities with
the remainder included in other non-current liabilities. The Company imputed interest on the note
payable using the effective yield method with a discount rate of 7.68%. At December 31, 2009 and
2008, the fair value of the note payable to Siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note
of $25.0 million and $26.0 million, respectively.

In June 2003, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured
convertible notes due June 2008, referred to herein as the convertible notes. The convertible
notes had a five-year term and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December
1. Each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes was convertible into 82.5592 shares of common
stock as adjusted, or a conversion price of $12.1125 per share. As of their maturity date, June 1,
2008, pursuant to the terms of the indenture, as amended, governing the convertible notes,
substantially all of the convertible notes were converted into an aggregate 33,022,740 shares of
common stock at the conversion price, with the balance paid in cash.

12. Intangible Assets and Goodwill 

Intangible Assets:  The Company s intangible assets consist of developed product rights
from the Pharmion acquisition, contract-based licenses, technology and an acquired workforce.
Remaining amortization periods related to these intangibles range from two to eleven years. A
summary of intangible assets by category follows:

The decrease in gross carrying value of intangibles at December 31, 2009 compared to December
31, 2008 was primarily due to the elimination of the $3.3 million intangible related to
RIMIFON   , which was obtained in the Pharmion acquisition and sold in March of 2009,
partly offset by the addition of two intangibles included under Technology totaling $2.5 million.

92 

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Amortization of intangible assets was $84.3 million, $104.4 million and $9.5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in amortization expense in 2009
compared to 2008 was due to several acquired developed product rights becoming fully amortized
during 2009 and the latter part of 2008. Assuming no changes in the gross carrying amount of
intangible assets, the amortization of intangible assets for the next five years is estimated to be
approximately $65.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2010, $64.8 million for the year
ending December 31, 2011 and approximately $64.5 million for each of the years ending December 31,
2012 through 2014.

Goodwill  :  At December 31, 2009, the Company s goodwill related to the March 7, 2008 acquisition of
Pharmion and the October 21, 2004 acquisition of Penn T Limited. The goodwill related to the
Pharmion acquisition reflects the allocation of the Pharmion purchase price.

The change in carrying value of goodwill is summarized as follows:

13. Related Party Transactions 

Under a license agreement between EntreMed and Royalty Pharma Finance Trust, or Royalty Pharma,
EntreMed is entitled to share in the THALOMID    royalty payments that the Company pays to
Royalty Pharma on annual THALOMID    sales in the United States and certain international
markets above an established threshold. The Company s share of EntreMed s royalties, based on its
ownership percentage in EntreMed, is eliminated from cost of goods sold and reflected in equity in
losses of affiliated companies (see Note 10).

14. Stockholders  Equity 

Preferred Stock:  The Board of Directors is authorized to issue, at any time, without further
stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the price,
rights, privileges, and preferences of such shares.

Common Stock:  At December 31, 2009, the Company was authorized to issue up to 575,000,000 shares
of common stock of which shares of common stock issued totaled 467,629,433.

Treasury Stock:  During 2009, 2008 and 2007, certain employees exercised stock options containing a
reload feature and, pursuant to the Company s stock option plan, tendered 39,681, 118,551
and 106,517 mature shares, respectively, related to stock option exercises. Such tendered shares
are reflected as treasury stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

On May 26, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase shares of its common stock from
Morgan Stanley   Co. Inc., for an aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million under an Accelerated
Share Repurchase, or ASR, program. The Company entered into this agreement as part of a $500.0
million
share repurchase program approved by its Board of Directors in April 2009. In addition, shares
were purchased on the open market under the share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2009, an
aggregate 4,314,625 shares have been repurchased at a total cost of $209.5 million.

A summary of changes in common stock issued and treasury stock is presented below:

Rights Plan:  During 1996, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan, or the Rights Plan.
The Rights Plan expired on February 17, 2010 and the Company did not adopt an updated plan. Prior
to its expiration, the Rights Plan involved the distribution of one right as a dividend on each
outstanding share of the Company s common stock to each holder of record on September 26, 1996.
Each right entitled the holder to purchase one-tenth of a share of common stock. The Rights traded
in tandem with the common stock until, and were exercisable upon, certain triggering events, and
the exercise price was based on the estimated long-term value of the Company s common stock. In
certain circumstances, the Rights Plan permitted the holders to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock at a discounted rate. The Company s Board of Directors retained the right at all
times prior to acquisition of 15% of the Company s voting common stock by an acquirer, to
discontinue the Rights Plan through the redemption of all rights or to amend the Rights Plan in any
respect. The Rights Plan, as amended on February 17, 2000, increased the exercise price per Right
from $100.00 to $700.00 and extended the final expiration date of the Rights Plan to February 17,
2010. On August 13, 2003, the Rights Plan was further amended to permit a qualified institutional
investor to beneficially own up to 17% of the Company s common stock outstanding without being
deemed an  acquiring person,  if such institutional investor meets certain requirements.

15. Share-Based Compensation 

On June 17, 2009, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment and restatement of the 2008
Stock Incentive Plan, or the Plan, which included the following key modifications:

Adoption of an aggregate share reserve of 70,781,641 shares of common stock. This number
includes the current share reserve of 52,372,191 shares of common stock, 18,100,000
additional new shares of common stock and 309,450 shares of common stock reserved but not
yet granted under the Directors  Incentive Plan. Each share of common stock subject to full
value awards (e.g., restricted stock, other stock-based awards or performance awards
denominated in common stock) will be counted as 1.6 shares against the aggregate share
reserve under the Plan;

Specifying that the maximum amount of shares of common stock subject to any award under
the Plan that may become subject to accelerated vesting will not be greater that 5% of the
total shares reserved for awards under the Plan, except that, with respect to any
participant other than a named executive officer, such 5% limit will not apply to any
accelerated vesting as a result of a change in control or a participant s retirement,
disability, death, layoff pursuant to a reduction in workforce or termination of employment
due to a business acquisition;

Clarification that the total number of shares of common stock available for awards will
be reduced by (i) the total number of stock options or stock appreciation rights exercised,
regardless of whether any of the shares of common stock underlying such awards are not
actually issued to the participant as the result of a net settlement and (ii) any shares of
common stock used to pay any exercise price or tax withholding obligation with respect to
any stock option or stock appreciation right. Shares of common stock repurchased by the
Company on the open market with the proceeds of a stock option exercise price will not be
added to the aggregate share reserve; and

an extension of the term of the Plan through April 15, 2019.

In lieu of the current awards under the Plan, an automatic grant to Non-Employee Directors as
follows (subject to adjustment in accordance with the Plan):

upon initial election or appointment to the Board of Directors, an award of a
nonqualified stock option to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock (this award is
consistent with the previous initial award under the Directors  Incentive Plan and vest in
four equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant);
and

upon election as a continuing member of the Board of Directors, an award of a
nonqualified stock option to purchase 12,333 shares of common stock
and 2,055 Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, in each
case, pro rated for partial years (this award will be in lieu of the previous annual award
under the Directors  Incentive Plan of an option to purchase 18,500 shares of common
stock). The stock options vest in full on the first anniversary of the date of the grant
and the Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs vest ratably over a three-year period. The
foregoing split between stock options and RSUs is based on a two-thirds and one-third mix
of stock options to RSUs, respectively, using a three-to-one ratio of stock options to RSUs
in calculating the number of RSUs. No discretionary award is permitted to be granted to
Non-Employee Directors, and the Compensation Committee will administer the Plan with
respect to awards for Non-Employee Directors (rather than the Board of Directors as
previously provided under the Directors  Incentive Plan).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

With respect to options granted under the Plan, the exercise price may not be less than the market
closing price of the common stock on the date of grant. In general, options granted under the Plan
vest over periods ranging from immediate vesting to four-year vesting and expire ten years from the
date of grant,
subject to earlier expiration in case of termination of employment unless the participant meets the
retirement provision under which the option would have a maximum of three additional years to vest.
The vesting period for options granted under the Plan is subject to certain acceleration
provisions if a change in control, as defined in the Plan, occurs. Plan participants may elect to
exercise options at any time during the option term. However, any shares so purchased which have
not vested as of the date of exercise shall be subject to forfeiture, which will lapse in
accordance with the established vesting time period.

As a result of the acquisition of Anthrogenesis in December 2002, the Company acquired the
Anthrogenesis Qualified Employee Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Non-Qualified Recruiting and
Retention Stock Option Plan. Neither plan has been approved by the Company s stockholders. No
future awards will be granted under either plan. Stock options issued and outstanding under both
plans are fully vested at December 31, 2009.

Shares of common stock available for future share-based grants under all plans were 25,899,044 at
December 31, 2009.

The following table summarizes the components of share-based compensation cost charged to the
consolidated statements of operations for years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Included in share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007 was compensation expense related to non-qualified stock options of $117.0 million, $77.5
million and $34.0 million, respectively.

Share-based compensation cost included in inventory was $1.9 million and $0.8 million at December
31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, there was $317.9 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the plans. That cost will be
recognized over an expected remaining weighted-average period of 2.5 years.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes method of valuation to determine the fair value of share-based
awards. Compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not
been rendered that are outstanding is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over
the remaining service period based on the award s original estimate of fair value and the estimated
number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimated forfeiture rate.

The Company does not recognize a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits that have not been
realized and has adopted the tax law method as its accounting policy regarding the ordering of tax
benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been realized.

Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
$49.8 million, $128.6 million and $144.7 million, respectively, and the excess tax benefit
recognized was $97.8 million, $153.0 million and $143.0 million, respectively.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of the stock options granted during the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $20.10, $25.94 and $24.54, respectively. The Company
estimated the fair value of options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions:

The fair value of stock options granted after January 1, 2006 is allocated to compensation
cost on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options granted before January 1, 2006 was
recognized over the attribution period using the graded vesting attribution approach. Compensation
cost is allocated over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting
periods.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon curve. Expected volatility
of stock option awards is estimated based on the implied volatility of the Company s publicly
traded options with settlement dates of six months. The use of implied volatility was based upon
the availability of actively traded options on the Company s common stock and the assessment that
implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.
The expected term of an employee share option is the period of time for which the option is
expected to be outstanding. The Company has made a determination of expected term by analyzing
employees  historical exercise experience from its history of grants and exercises in the Company s
option database and management estimates. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data.

In December 2005, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to grant the 2006 annual stock
option awards under the 1998 Incentive Stock Plan, currently renamed the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan,
in 2005. All stock options awarded were granted fully vested. Half of the options granted had an
exercise price of $34.05 per option, which was at a 5% premium to the closing price of the
Company s common stock of $32.43 per share on the grant date of December 29, 2005; the remaining
options granted had an exercise price of $35.67 per option, which was at a 10% premium to the
closing price of the Company s common stock of $32.43 per share on the grant date of December 29,
2005. The Board s decision to grant these options was in recognition of the REVLIMID   
regulatory approval and in response to a review of the Company s long-term incentive compensation
programs. The granting of these fully vested options resulted in the Company not being required to
recognize cumulative compensation expense of approximately $70.8 million for the four-year period
ended December 31, 2009.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007 was $157.3 million, $443.7 million and $470.5 million, respectively. The Company
primarily utilizes newly issued shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options. The total fair
value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $29.3 million,
$30.4 million and $38.9 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes information concerning options outstanding under all plans at
December 31, 2009:

Stock options granted to executives at the vice-president level and above under the Plan,
formerly the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, after September 18, 2000, contained a reload feature which
provided that if (1) the optionee exercises all or any portion of the stock option (a) at least six
months prior to the expiration of the stock option, (b) while employed by the Company and (c) prior
to the expiration date of the Plan and (2) the optionee pays the exercise price for the portion of
the stock option exercised or the minimum statutory applicable withholding taxes by using common
stock owned by the optionee for at least six months prior to the date of exercise, the optionee
shall be granted a new stock option under the Plan on the date all or any portion of the stock
option is exercised to purchase the number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares
of common stock exchanged by the optionee. The reload stock option is exercisable on the same
terms and conditions as apply to the original stock option except that (x) the reload stock option
will become exercisable in full on the day which is six months after the date the original stock
option is exercised, (y) the exercise price shall be the fair value (as defined in the Plan) of the
common stock on the date the reload stock option is granted and (z) the expiration of the reload
stock option will be the date of expiration of the original stock option. As of December 31, 2009,
236,380 options that contain the reload features noted above are still outstanding and are included
in the tables above. The Plan was amended to eliminate the reload feature for all stock options
granted on or after October 1, 2004.

Restricted Stock Units:  The Company began issuing restricted stock units, or RSUs, under its
equity program during the second quarter of 2009 in order to provide an effective incentive award
with a strong retention component. Equity awards may, at the option of employee participants, be
divided between stock options and RSUs based on a two-thirds and one-third mix, respectively, using
a three-to-one ratio of stock options to RSUs in calculating the number of RSUs to be granted. The
fair value of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the
grant dates. Information regarding the Company s RSUs for 2009 is as follows:

There were no RSUs that vested during 2009. The Company expects to primarily utilize newly
issued shares to satisfy the vesting of RSUs.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $14.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested awards of RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.3 years. The Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period for the entire award, as adjusted for expected forfeitures.

Warrants:   In connection with its acquisition of Anthrogenesis, the Company assumed the
Anthrogenesis warrants outstanding, which were convertible into warrants to purchase 867,356 shares
of the Company s common stock. Anthrogenesis had issued warrants to investors at exercise prices
equivalent to the per share price of their investment. As of December 31, 2009, Celgene had 72,868
warrants outstanding to acquire an equivalent number of shares of Celgene common stock at a
weighted average exercise price of $3.25 per warrant. Warrants exercised in 2009 totaled 305,784.
No warrants were exercised in 2008 and 2007. The remaining warrants expire on various dates from
2010 to 2012.

16. Employee Benefit Plans 

The Company sponsors an employee savings and retirement plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or the Code, for its U.S. employees. The Company s
contributions to the U.S. savings plan are discretionary and have historically been made in the
form of the Company s common stock (See Note 14). Such contributions are based on specified
percentages of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation or a maximum permitted by
law. Total expense for contributions to the U.S. savings plans were $10.6 million, $8.3 million
and $5.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company also sponsors defined
contribution plans in certain foreign locations. Participation in these plans is subject to the
local laws that are in effect for each country and may include statutorily imposed minimum
contributions. The Company also maintains defined benefit plans in certain foreign locations for
which the obligations and the net periodic pension costs were determined to be immaterial at
December 31, 2009.

In 2000, the Company s Board of Directors approved a deferred compensation plan effective September
1, 2000. In February 2005, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the Celgene Corporation 2005
Deferred Compensation Plan, effective as of January 1, 2005, and amended the plan in February 2008.
This plan operates as the Company s ongoing deferred compensation plan and is intended to comply
with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which added new Section 409A to the Code, changing the
income tax treatment, design and administration of certain plans that provide for the deferral of
compensation. The Company s Board of Directors froze the 2000 deferred compensation plan, effective
as of December 31, 2004, and no additional contributions or deferrals can be made to that plan.
Accrued benefits under the frozen plan will continue to be governed by the terms under the tax laws
in effect prior to the enactment of Section 409A. Eligible participants, which include certain
top-level executives of the Company as specified by the plan, can elect to defer up to an amended
90% of the participant s base salary, 100% of cash bonuses and equity compensation allowed under
Section 409A of the Code. Company contributions to the deferred compensation plan represent a
match to certain participants  deferrals up to a specified percentage (currently ranging from 10%
to 20%, depending on the employee s position as specified in the plan, and ranging from 10% to 25% through December 31, 2006) of the participant s base salary. The Company recorded expense of $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.6
million related to the deferred compensation plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
Company s recurring matches are fully vested, upon contribution. All other Company contributions
to the plan do not vest until the specified requirements are met. At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
the Company had a deferred compensation liability included in other non-current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets of approximately $36.6 million and $25.5 million, respectively, which
included the participant s elected deferral of salaries and bonuses, the Company s matching
contribution and earnings on deferred amounts as of that date. The plan provides various
alternatives for the measurement of earnings on the amounts participants defer under the plan. The
measuring alternatives are based on returns of a variety of funds that offer plan participants the
option to spread their risk across a diverse group of investments.

The Company has established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with performance-based incentive
opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a three-year period. The Company currently has
three separate three-year performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Performance measures for the Plans are
based on the following components in the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP earnings per share, 25% on non-GAAP net income and 50%
on total non-GAAP revenue, as defined.

Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participant s salary for the LTIPs. The estimated
payout for the concluded 2009 Plan is $5.9 million, which is included in other current liabilities at December
31, 2009, and the maximum potential payout, assuming maximum objectives are achieved for the 2010, 2011 and 2012
Plans are $9.6 million, $10.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively. Such awards are payable in cash or, at the Company s
discretion, payable in common stock based upon its stock price on the payout date. The Company accrues the long-term incentive
liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of the
Company s level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate
payment equal to their target award or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in
control. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized expense related to the
LTIP of $5.5 million, $6.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively.

17. Sponsored Research, License and Other Agreements 

Novartis Pharma AG:   The Company entered into an agreement with Novartis in which the Company granted to
Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding Canada) to develop and market FOCALIN    (d-methylphenidate, or d   MPH)
and FOCALIN XR   , the long-acting drug formulation. The Company has retained the exclusive commercial rights to FOCALIN   
and FOCALIN XR    for oncology-related disorders, such as chronic fatigue associated with chemotherapy. The Company also granted
Novartis rights to all of its related intellectual property and patents, including formulations of the currently
marketed RITALIN LA   . The Company also sells FOCALIN    to Novartis and receives royalties on sales
of all of Novartis  FOCALIN XR    and RITALIN    family of ADHD-related products.

Array BioPharma Inc.:   The Company has a research collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma
Inc., or Array, focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics
in cancer and inflammation. As part of this agreement, the Company made an upfront payment in
September 2007 to Array of $40.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expense,
in return for an option to receive exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against two
of the four research targets defined in the agreement, except for Array s limited U.S.
co-promotional rights. In June 2009, the Company made an additional upfront payment of $4.5
million to expand the research targets defined in the agreement, which was recorded as research and
development expense. Array will be responsible for all discovery and clinical development through
Phase I or Phase IIa and be entitled to receive, for each compound, potential milestone payments of
approximately $200.0 million, if certain discovery, development and regulatory milestones are
achieved and $300.0 million if certain commercial milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on
net sales.

The Company s option will terminate upon the earlier of either a termination of the agreement, the
date the Company has exercised its options for compounds developed against two of the four research
targets defined in the agreement, or September 21, 2012, unless the term is extended. The Company
may unilaterally extend the option term for two additional one-year terms until September 21, 2014
and the parties may mutually extend the term for two additional one-year terms until September 21,
2016. Upon exercise of a Company option, the agreement will continue until the Company has
satisfied all royalty payment obligations to Array. Upon the expiration of the agreement, Array
will grant the Company a fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use certain intellectual properties
of Array to market and sell the compounds and products developed under the agreement. The
agreement may expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis as the Company satisfies
its royalty payment obligation with respect to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be terminated by:

(iii) 
       
      the Company at its sole discretion, or

(iv) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole discretion or by Array for a material
breach by the Company, then the Company s rights to the compounds and products developed under the
agreement will revert to Array. If the agreement is terminated by Array for a material breach by
the Company, then the Company will also grant to Array a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to
certain intellectual property controlled by the Company necessary to continue the development of
such compounds and products. If the agreement is terminated by the Company for a material breach
by Array, then, among other things, the Company s payment obligations under the agreement could be
either reduced by 50% or terminated entirely.

PTC Therapeutics, Inc.:   In September 2007, the Company invested $20.0 million, of which $1.1
million represented research and development expense, in Series F-2 Convertible Preferred Stock of
PTC Therapeutics, Inc., or PTC, and in December 2009, we invested an additional $1.5 million in
Series G Convertible Preferred Stock of PTC. In September 2007, we also entered into a separate
research and option agreement whereby PTC would perform discovery research activities. Under the
agreement, both parties could subsequently agree to advance research on certain discovery targets
and enter into a separate pre-negotiated collaboration and license agreement which would replace
the original research and option agreement.

On July 16, 2009, the Company and PTC agreed to advance research on one discovery target and
entered into a pre-negotiated collaboration and license agreement under which PTC is eligible to
receive quarterly research fees, as defined in the agreement, and is entitled to receive potential
milestone payments of approximately $129.0 million if certain development, regulatory and
sales-based milestones are achieved.

102

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

PTC will also receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales. Under the agreement, the Company
may transfer certain research and development activities from PTC to the Company and upon such
transfer the Company will no longer fund such quarterly research fees to PTC.

The agreement will continue until the Company has satisfied all royalty payment obligations to PTC.
Upon the Company s full satisfaction of its royalty payment obligations to PTC under the
agreement, the license granted to the Company by PTC under the agreement will become a
non-exclusive, fully paid-up, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use certain intellectual
property of PTC to market and sell the products developed under the agreement. The agreement may
expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis as the Company satisfies its royalty
payment obligation with respect to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be terminated by:

(iii) 
       
      the Company at its sole discretion following the first anniversary of the agreement, or

(iv) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole discretion or by PTC for a material
breach by the Company, then all licenses granted to the Company under the agreement will terminate.
If PTC materially breaches any of its obligations under the agreement, the Company can either
terminate the agreement, in which case all licenses and rights granted under the agreement are
terminated, or elect to continue the agreement, in which case all milestone obligations cease and
future royalties payable by the Company under the agreement will be reduced by between 50% and 70%.

Acceleron Pharma:   The Company has a worldwide strategic collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or
Acceleron, for the joint development and commercialization of ACE-011, currently being studied for
treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia in metastatic breast cancer, metastatic bone disease and
renal anemia. The collaboration combines both companies  resources and commitment to developing
products for the treatment of cancer and cancer-related bone loss. The agreement also includes an
option for certain discovery stage programs. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company and
Acceleron will jointly develop, manufacture and commercialize Acceleron s products for bone loss.
The Company made an upfront payment to Acceleron in February 2008 of $50.0 million, which included
a $5.0 million equity investment in Acceleron, with the remainder recorded as research and
development expense. In addition, in the event of an initial public offering of Acceleron, the
Company will purchase a minimum of $7.0 million of Acceleron common stock.

Acceleron will retain responsibility for initial activities, including research and development,
through the end of Phase IIa clinical trials, as well as manufacturing the clinical supplies for
these studies. In turn, the Company will conduct the Phase IIb and Phase III clinical studies and
will oversee the manufacture of Phase III and commercial supplies. Acceleron will pay a share of
the development expenses and is eligible to receive development, regulatory approval and
sales-based milestones of up to $510.0 million for the ACE-011 program and up to an additional
$437.0 million for each of the three discovery stage programs. The companies will co-promote the
products in North America. Acceleron will receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.

The agreement will continue until the Company has satisfied all royalty payment obligations to
Acceleron and the Company has either exercised or forfeited all of its options under the agreement.
Upon the Company s full satisfaction of its royalty payment obligations to Acceleron under the
agreement, all licenses granted to the Company by Acceleron under the agreement will become fully
paid-up, perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable and royalty-free licenses. The agreement may expire
on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis as the Company satisfies its royalty payment
obligation with respect to each product in each country.

the Company for a material breach by Acceleron, then, among other things, (A) the licenses granted
to Acceleron under the agreement will terminate, (B) the licenses granted to the Company will
continue in perpetuity, (C) all future royalties payable by the Company under the agreement will be
reduced by 50% and (D) the Company s obligation to make any future milestone payments will
terminate.

Cabrellis Pharmaceuticals Corp.:   The Company, as a result of its acquisition of Pharmion, obtained
an exclusive license to develop and commercialize amrubicin in North America and Europe pursuant to
a license agreement with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd, or DSP. Pursuant to Pharmion s
acquisition of Cabrellis Pharmaceutics Corp., or Cabrellis, prior to the Company s acquisition of
Pharmion, the Company will pay $12.5 million for each approval of amrubicin in an initial
indication by regulatory authorities in the United States and the European Union, or E.U., to the
former shareholders of Cabrellis. Upon approval of amrubicin for a second indication in the United
States or E.U., the Company will pay an additional $10.0 million for each market to the former
shareholders of Cabrellis. Under the terms of the license agreement for amrubicin, the Company is
required to make milestone payments of $7.0 million and $1.0 million to DSP upon regulatory
approval of amrubicin in the United States and upon receipt of the first approval in the E.U.,
respectively, and up to $17.5 million upon achieving certain annual sales levels in the United
States. Pursuant to the supply agreement for amrubicin, the Company is to pay DSP a semiannual
supply price calculated as a percentage of net sales for a period of ten years. In September 2008,
amrubicin was granted fast track product designation by the FDA for the treatment of small cell
lung cancer after first-line chemotherapy.

The amrubicin license expires on a country-by-country basis and on a product-by-product basis upon
the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the applicable product in a
given country after the issuance of marketing authorization in such country and (ii) the first day
of the first quarter for which the total number of generic product units sold in a given country
exceeds 20% of the total number of generic product units sold plus licensed product units sold in
the relevant country during the same calendar quarter.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the amrubicin license may be terminated by:

(iii) 
       
      the Company at its sole discretion,

(iv) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy,

(iii) 
       
      DSP if the Company takes any action to challenge the title or validity of the
patents owned by DSP, or

(iv) 
       
      DSP in the event of a change in control of the Company.

If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole discretion or by DSP under circumstances
described in clauses (ii)(x) and (iii) above, then the Company will transfer its rights to the
compounds and products developed under the agreement to DSP and will also grant to DSP a
non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property controlled by the
Company necessary to continue the development of such compounds and products. If the agreement is
terminated by the Company for a material breach by DSP, then, among other things, DSP will grant to
the Company an exclusive, perpetual, paid-up license to all of the intellectual property of DSP
necessary to continue the development, marketing and selling of the compounds and products subject
to the agreement.

GlobeImmune, Inc.:   In September 2007, the Company made a $3.0 million equity investment in
GlobeImmune, Inc., or GlobeImmune. In April 2009 and May 2009, the Company made additional $0.1
million and $10.0 million equity investments, respectively, in GlobeImmune. In addition, the
Company has a collaboration and option agreement with GlobeImmune focused on the discovery,
development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer. As part of this agreement, the
Company made an upfront payment in May 2009 of $30.0 million, which was recorded as research and
development expense, to GlobeImmune in return for the option to license compounds and products
based on the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs as well as
oncology compounds and products resulting from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune.
GlobeImmune will be responsible for all discovery and clinical development until the Company
exercises its option with respect to a drug candidate program and GlobeImmune will be entitled to
receive potential milestone payments of approximately $230.0 million for the GI-4000 program,
$145.0 million for each of the GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 programs as well as $161.0 million for
each additional future program if certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones are
achieved. GlobeImmune will also receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.

The Company s options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug
candidate programs will terminate if the Company does not exercise its respective options after
delivery of certain reports from GlobeImmune on the completed clinical trials with respect to each
drug candidate program, as set forth in the initial development plan specified in the agreement.
If the Company does not exercise its options with respect to any drug candidate program or future
program, the Company s option with respect to the oncology products resulting from future programs
controlled by GlobeImmune will terminate three years after the last of the options with respect to
the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs terminates. Upon
exercise of a Company option, the agreement will continue until the Company has satisfied all
royalty payment obligations to GlobeImmune. Upon the expiration of the agreement, on a product by
product, country by country basis, GlobeImmune will grant the Company an exclusive, fully paid-up,
royalty-free, perpetual, license to use certain intellectual properties of GlobeImmune to market
and sell the compounds and products developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire on a
product-by-product and country-by-country basis as the Company satisfies its royalty payment
obligation with respect to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be terminated by:

(iii) 
       
      the Company at its sole discretion, or

(iv) 
       
      either party if the other party:

(x) 
       
      materially breaches any of its material obligations under the
agreement, or

(y) 
       
      files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole discretion or by GlobeImmune for a
material breach by the Company, then the Company s rights to the compounds and products developed
under the agreement will revert to GlobeImmune. If the agreement is terminated by the Company for
a material breach by GlobeImmune, then, among other things, the Company s royalty payment
obligations under the agreement will be reduced by 50%, the Company s development milestone payment
obligations under the agreement will be reduced by 50% or terminated entirely and the Company s
sales milestone payment obligations under the agreement will be terminated entirely.

18. Income Taxes 

The income tax provision is based on income (loss) before income taxes as follows:

The provision (benefit) for taxes on income is as follows:

Amounts are reflected in the preceding tables based on the location of the taxing authorities. As
of December 31, 2009, the Company has not made a U.S. tax provision on $2.846 billion of unremitted
earnings of its international subsidiaries. These earnings are expected to be reinvested overseas
indefinitely. It is not practicable to compute the estimated deferred tax liability on these
earnings.

The Company operates under an incentive tax holiday in Switzerland that expires in 2015 and exempts
the Company from most Swiss income taxes.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax
accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect on these temporary
differences as deferred tax assets (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
in future periods) or deferred tax liabilities (generally items for which the Company received a
tax deduction but that have not yet been recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations).
The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and
reduces the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it
believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the
likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings
experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods
available to it for tax reporting purposes, tax planning strategies and other relevant factors.
Significant judgment is required in making this assessment.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008 the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred
tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified on the Company s

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

At December 31, 2009, the Company had combined state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of
approximately $431.7 million that will expire in the years 2010 through 2029. The Company also has
research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $40.8 million that will expire
in the years 2015 through 2028. Excess tax benefits related to stock option deductions incurred
after December 31, 2005 are required to be recognized in the period in which the tax deduction is
realized through a reduction of income taxes payable. As a result, the Company has not recorded
deferred tax assets for certain stock option deductions included in its NOL carryforwards and
research and experimentation credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2009, deferred tax assets have
not been recorded on combined state NOL carryforwards of approximately $226.0 million and for
research and experimentation credits of approximately $18.8 million. These stock option tax
benefits will be recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital when realized.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, it was more likely than not that the Company would realize its
deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. The principal valuation allowance relates to
Swiss deferred tax assets and is the result of the Swiss tax holiday.

The Company realized stock option deduction benefits in 2009, 2008 and 2007 for income tax purposes
and has increased additional paid-in capital in the amount of approximately $98.8 million ,  $160.6
million and $159.3 million, respectively. The Company has recorded deferred income taxes as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income resulting in deferred income tax liabilities at
December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $0.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively.

The Company s U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited by the IRS through the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2005. Tax returns for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 are
currently under examination by the IRS. The Company is also subject to audits by various state and
foreign taxing authorities, including, but not limited to, most U.S. states and major European and
Asian countries where the Company has operations.

The Company regularly reevaluates its tax positions and the associated interest and penalties, if
applicable, resulting from audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, as well as
changes in tax law that would reduce the technical merits of the position to below more likely than
not. The Company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years.
Many factors are considered in making these evaluations, including past history, recent
interpretations of tax law and the specifics of each matter. Because tax regulations are subject to
interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain, these evaluations can involve a series
of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The
Company applies a variety of methodologies in making these estimates and assumptions, which include
studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation
of public actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as
the Company s industry experience. These evaluations are based on estimates and assumptions that
have been deemed reasonable by management. However, if management s estimates are not
representative of actual outcomes, the Company s results of operations could be materially
impacted.

Unrecognized tax benefits, generally represented by liabilities on the balance sheet, arise when
the estimated benefit recorded in the financial statements differs from the amounts taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return because of the uncertainties described above. A reconciliation
of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its
provision for income taxes. Accrued interest at December 31, 2009 and 2008 is approximately $21.2
million and $13.4 million, respectively.

The Company effectively settled examinations with the IRS and with a foreign taxing jurisdiction in
early 2009. The foreign examination related to a subsidiary acquired in the Pharmion acquisition.
These settlements resulted in a net decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related
to tax positions taken in prior years of $35.8 million. In 2009, the Company recorded an increase
in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for prior years related to ongoing income tax audits
in various taxing jurisdictions.

These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations.
If recognized, unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $400.8 million would have a net impact on
the effective tax rate. The Company s tax returns are under routine examination in many taxing
jurisdictions. The Company anticipates that certain of these examinations may be settled in their
ordinary course and it is reasonably possible that the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will
decrease by $27.8 million over the next 12 months as part of these settlements. Liabilities for
unrecognized tax benefits that the Company anticipates will be settled within one year are
classified as current liabilities. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is expected to
increase in the next 12 months relating to operations occurring in that period.

19. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings 

Leases:  The Company leases offices and research facilities under various operating lease agreements
in the United States and international markets. At December 31, 2009, the non-cancelable lease
terms for the operating leases expire at various dates between 2010 and 2018 and include renewal
options. In general, the Company is also required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes,
insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2009 are:

Total rental expense under operating leases was approximately $24.4 million in 2009, $20.4 million
in 2008 and $11.7 million in 2007.

Lines of Credit:  The Company maintains lines of credit with several banks to support its hedging
programs and to facilitate the issuance of bank letters of credit and guarantees on behalf of its
subsidiaries. Lines of credit supporting the Company s hedging programs as of December 31, 2009
allowed the Company to enter into derivative contracts with settlement dates through 2011. As of
December 31, 2009, the Company has entered into derivative contracts with net notional amounts
totaling $1.107 billion. Lines of credit facilitating the issuance of bank letters of credit and
guarantees as of December 31, 2009 allowed the Company to have letters of credit and guarantees
issued on behalf of its subsidiaries totaling $30.3 million.

Other Commitments:  The Company s obligations related to product supply contracts totaled $146.2
million at December 31, 2009. The Company also owns an interest in two limited partnership
investment funds. The Company has committed to invest an additional $10.5 million into one of the
funds which is callable any time within a ten-year period, which expires on February 28, 2016.

Collaboration Arrangements:  The Company has entered into certain research and development
collaboration arrangements with third parties that include the funding of certain development,
manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty
payments upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and /or commercial
targets. The Company s obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in
the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the
programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the future potential payments are inherently
uncertain, and accordingly no amounts have been recorded in the Company s consolidated balance
sheets at December 31, 2009 or 2008, respectively (See Note 17).

Contingencies:  The Company believes it maintains insurance coverage adequate for its current needs.
The Company s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose
limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the
treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company reviews the effects of
such laws and regulations on its operations and modifies its operations as appropriate. The Company
believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Legal Proceedings: 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various patent, commercial and other
claims; government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the
ordinary course of the Company s business.

Patent proceedings include challenges to scope, validity or enforceability of its patents relating
to its various products or processes. Although the Company believe it has substantial defenses to
these challenges with respect to all of its material patents, there can be no assurance as to the
outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent
protection for the drug at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and
could materially affect future results of operations.

Among the principal matters pending to which the Company is a party, are the following:

THALOMID   

Barr Laboratories, Inc., or Barr, a generic drug manufacturer located in Pomona, New York, filed an
ANDA for the treatment of ENL in the manner described in the Company s label and seeking permission
from the FDA to market a generic version of 50mg, 100mg and 200mg THALOMID   . Barr has
notified us that it merged with Teva, and Barr is now Barr Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Teva. Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic manufacturer may file
an ANDA with a certification (a  Paragraph IV certification ) challenging the validity or
infringement of a patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book four years after the pioneer company
obtains approval of its NDA. On or after December 5, 2006, Barr mailed notices of Paragraph IV
certifications alleging that the following patents listed for THALOMID    in the Orange
Book are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,045,501 ( the  501
patent ), 6,315,720 ( the  720 patent ), 6,561,976 ( the  976 patent ), 6,561,977 ( the  977
patent ), 6,755,784 ( the  784 patent ), 6,869,399 ( the  399 patent ), 6,908,432 ( the  432
patent ), and 7,141,018 ( the  018 patent ). The  501,  976, and  432 patents do not expire until
August 28, 2018, while the remaining patents do not expire until October 23, 2020. On January 18,
2007, the Company filed an infringement action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey against
Barr. By bringing suit, the Company is entitled to a 30-month stay, from the date of its receipt of
the Paragraph IV certification, the last of which will expire in November 2010, against the FDA s
approval of a generic applicant s application to market a generic version of THALOMID   . In June
2007, U.S. Patent No. 7,230,012, or  012 patent, was issued to the Company claiming formulations of
thalidomide and was then timely listed in the Orange Book. Barr sent the Company a supplemental
Paragraph IV certification against the  012 patent and alleged that the claims of the  012 patent,
directed to formulations which encompass THALOMID   , were invalid. On August 23, 2007, the Company
filed an infringement action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey with respect to the  012
patent. On or after October 4, 2007, Barr filed a second supplemental notice of Paragraph IV
certifications relating to the 150 mg dosage strength of THALOMID    alleging that the
 501 patent,  720 patent,  976 patent,  977 patent,  784 patent,  399 patent,  432 patent and the
 018 patent are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed. On November 14, 2007, the Company
filed an infringement action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey against Barr which entitled
us to a second 30-month stay, expiring in November 2010. All three actions have subsequently been
consolidated. The Company intends to enforce its patent rights. If the ANDA is approved by the FDA,
and Barr is successful in challenging the Company s patents listed in the Orange Book for
THALOMID   , Barr would be permitted to sell a generic thalidomide product. If the Company is
unsuccessful in the suits and the FDA were to approve a comprehensive education and risk-management
distribution program for a generic version of thalidomide, sales of THALOMID    could be
significantly reduced in the United States by the entrance of a generic thalidomide product,
consequently reducing the Company s revenue.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

In July 2008, the Company and its co-plaintiff Children s Medical Center Corp., or CMCC, asserted
two Orange-Book listed patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,629,327 and 6,235,756) relating to uses of
thalidomide for the treatment of various cancers, including multiple myeloma. The Company filed the
action in response to Notices of Paragraph IV certification in connection with Barr s ANDA seeking
approval to market generic versions for the Company s THALOMID    capsules. Because both of those
patents were listed in the Orange Book when Barr originally filed its ANDA (Barr originally failed
to certify under Paragraph IV against either patent), a second 30-month stay applies, and Barr s
ANDA may not receive final approval until November 2010. Barr has asserted counterclaims seeking
declarations of noninfringement, invalidity, and unenforceability. In December 2008, the Company
and CMCC asserted a third Orange-Book patent relating to uses of thalidomide for the treatment of
various cancers, including multiple myeloma. The Company filed the action in response to Notices of
Paragraph IV certification in connection with Barr s ANDA seeking approval to market generic
versions for its THALOMID    capsules. Barr has asserted counterclaims seeking declarations of
noninfringement and invalidity. All of the above thalidomide actions have been consolidated.

The parties have completed the bulk of fact discovery, and general fact discovery is now closed.
The parties expect the Court to resolve Barr s motion in February 2010. No schedule has been set
for claim construction or expert discovery. No trial date has been set.

FOCALIN    and FOCALIN XR   

On August 19, 2004, the Company, together with its exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an
infringement action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA,
Inc., or Teva, in response to notices of Paragraph IV certifications made by Teva in connection
with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN   . The notification letters from Teva contend that U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,908,850, or  850 patent, and 6,355,656, or  656 patent, are invalid. After the suit
was filed, Novartis listed another patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,528,530, or  530 patent, in the Orange
Book in association with the FOCALIN    NDA. The original 2004 action asserted infringement of the
 850 patent. Teva amended its answer during discovery to contend that the  850 patent was not
infringed by the filing of its ANDA, and that the  850 patent is not enforceable due to an
allegation of inequitable conduct. Fact discovery in the original 2004 action expired on February
28, 2006. At about the time of the filing of the  850 patent infringement action, reexamination
proceedings for the  656 patent were initiated in the U.S. PTO. On September 28, 2006, the U.S. PTO
issued a Notice of Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate, and on March 27, 2007, the
Reexamination Certificate for the  656 patent issued. On December 21, 2006, the Company and
Novartis filed an action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey against Teva for infringement of
the  656 patent. Teva filed an amended answer and counterclaim on March 23, 2007. The amended
counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and
unenforceability. The statutory 30-month stay, to which Paragraph IV certifications (including
those below) are entitled to, expired on January 9, 2007, and Teva proceeded to market with a
generic version of FOCALIN   . Plaintiffs  complaints included a request for an injunction against
future sales of Teva s generic products, as well as a claim for money damages for actual sales.
This action has been resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement dated December 9,
2009. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties sought (and the Court allowed) a 60-day
stay of the litigation, in order to allow for review of the settlement agreement by the Federal
Trade Commission and Department of Justice. The case was dismissed on February 1, 2010.

On September 14, 2007, the Company, together with its exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an
infringement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by Teva in
connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN XR   . The notification letter from Teva contends
that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850 and 6,528,530 are invalid, unenforceable, and not
infringed by the proposed Teva products, and it contends that U.S. Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and
6,635,284 are invalid and not infringed by the proposed Teva products. The Company and Novartis
asserted each of these patents and additionally asserted U.S. Patent No. 6,355,656 in its complaint
against Teva. Subsequently, plaintiffs added claims for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,431,944.
This action has been resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement dated December 9,
2009. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties sought (and the Court allowed) a 60-day
stay of the litigation, in order to allow for review of the settlement agreement by the Federal
Trade Commission and Department of Justice. The case was dismissed on February 1, 2010.

On October 5, 2007, the Company, together with its exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an
infringement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against
IntelliPharmaCeutics Corp., or IPC, in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by
IPC in connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN XR   . The notification letter from IPC
contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not infringed by
the proposed IPC products. The notification letter also contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos.
5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are invalid, and that claims in U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656 and 6,528,530 are unenforceable. In its complaint against IPC, the
Company and Novartis asserted U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and
6,635,284. IPC filed an answer and counterclaim on November 20, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a
declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, non infringement, and unenforceability with respect to
Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, and 6,528,530, and it seeks a declaratory judgment of patent
invalidity and non infringement with respect to Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. The Company
and Novartis subsequently added claims against IPC for infringement of United States patent No.
7,431,944. Fact discovery has expired and claim construction briefing has been completed. Expert
discovery has yet to be completed. On October 23, 2009, the court administratively struck the
pleadings relating to claim construction, in order to afford the parties a chance to determine
whether a settlement can be reached. If the Company is unsuccessful in proving infringement or
defending its patents, Novartis  sales of FOCALIN XR    could be significantly reduced in the United
States by the entrance of a generic FOCALIN XR    product, consequently reducing the Company s
revenue from royalties associated with these sales. If settlement cannot be reached, the claim
construction and other litigation proceedings will move forward.

On November 8, 2007, the Company, together with its exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an
infringement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Actavis South
Atlantic LLC and Abrika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively,  Actavis ) in response to a notice of
a Paragraph IV certification made by Actavis in connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN
XR   . The notification letter from Actavis contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850,
6,355,656, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed Actavis products, and it
contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284 and 6,635,284
are invalid. In its complaint against Actavis, the Company and Novartis asserted U.S. Patent Nos.
5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284. Actavis filed an answer and
counterclaim, seeking a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, non-infringement, and
unenforceability with respect to the patents-in-suit. Plaintiffs subsequently added claims against
Actavis for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,431,944. Fact discovery has expired and claim
construction briefing has been completed. Expert discovery has yet to be completed. No trial date
has been set. On October 23, 2009, the court administratively struck the pleadings relating to
claim construction, in order to afford the parties a chance to determine whether a settlement can
be reached. If the Company is unsuccessful in proving infringement or defending its patents,
Novartis  sales of FOCALIN XR    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the entrance
of a generic FOCALIN XR    product, consequently reducing the Company s revenue from royalties
associated with these sales. If settlement cannot be reached, the claim construction and other
litigation proceedings will move forward.

infringement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Barr and Barr
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by Barr in
connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN XR   . The notification letter from Barr contends
that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not infringed by
the proposed Barr products, and it contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656,

Company and Novartis subsequently added claims against Barr for infringement of U.S. Patent No.
7,431,944. Fact discovery has expired, claim construction briefing has been completed, and no trial
date has been set. This action has been resolved pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement
dated December 9, 2009. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties sought (and the Court
allowed) a 60-day stay of the litigation, in order to allow for review of the settlement agreement
by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. The case was dismissed on February 1,
2010.

On December 5, 2008, the Company, together with its exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an
infringement action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against KV
Pharmaceutical Company ( KV ) in response to two notices of Paragraph IV certification made by KV
in connection with its filing of an ANDA for generic versions of the FOCALIN XR    products. In its
complaint against KV, the Company and Novartis asserted U.S. Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656,
6,528,530, 5,837,284, 6,635,284, and 7,431,944. KV filed an answer and counterclaim on January 20,
2009, seeking a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, non-infringement and unenforceability
with respect to the patents-in-suit. Fact discovery is complete or substantially complete, and
claim construction briefing has been completed. Expert discovery has yet to be completed. No trial
date has been set. On October 23, 2009, the court administratively struck the pleadings relating to
claim construction, in order to afford the parties a chance to determine whether a settlement can
be reached. If the Company is unsuccessful in proving infringement or defending its patents,
Novartis  sales of FOCALIN XR    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the entrance
of a generic FOCALIN XR    product, consequently reducing the Company s revenue from royalties
associated with these sales. If settlement cannot be reached, the claim construction and other

response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by Abrika Pharmaceuticals in connection
with the filing of an ANDA for RITALIN LA    20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg generic products. The
notification letter from Abrika Pharmaceuticals contends that claims in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,837,284
and 6,635,284 are invalid and are not infringed by the proposed Abrika Pharmaceuticals products. In
its complaint against Abrika Pharmaceuticals, the Company and Novartis asserted U.S. Patent Nos.
5,837,284 and 6,635,284. Abrika Pharmaceuticals filed an answer and counterclaim in the New Jersey
court on June 1, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity,
noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect to the patents-in-suit. On September 26, 2007,
Abrika Pharmaceuticals sent a Paragraph IV certification to the Company and Novartis in connection
with the filing of an ANDA supplement with respect to Abrika Pharmaceuticals  proposed generic 10
mg RITALIN LA    product. The Company and Novartis filed an amended complaint against Abrika
Pharmaceuticals on November 5, 2007 that includes infringement allegations directed to Abrika
Pharmaceuticals  proposed generic 10 mg RITALIN LA    product. Abrika Pharmaceuticals filed an answer
and counterclaim to the amended complaint on December 5, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory
judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect to the
patents-in-suit. If the Company is unsuccessful in proving infringement or defending its patents,
Novartis  sales of RITALIN LA    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the entrance
of a generic RITALIN LA    product, consequently reducing its revenue from royalties associated with
these sales. Fact discovery has expired and claim construction briefing has been completed. Expert
discovery will commence after the court has construed the claims of the patents-in-suit. No trial
date has been set.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

CONCLUSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on
the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents   

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our principal executive and
principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our
transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In connection with the preparation of our annual consolidated financial statements, management has
undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO
Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control
over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.

Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
statements included in this report, has issued their report on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, a copy of which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Celgene Corporation:

We have audited Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries  internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Celgene
Corporation and subsidiaries  management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Celgene
Corporation and subsidiaries  internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows
and stockholders  equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009,
and our report dated February 18, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.
