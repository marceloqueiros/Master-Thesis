PART I  

ITEM 1.      

BUSINESS   

Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively
     we ,  our  or  us ) is a global
    integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the
    discovery, development and commercialization of innovative
    therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory
    related diseases. We are dedicated to innovative research and
    development which is designed to bring new therapies to market
    and are involved in research in several scientific areas that
    may deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, targeting
    areas such as immunomodulation and intracellular signaling
    pathways in hematology, oncology and immune-inflammatory
    diseases. The products we develop are designed to treat
    life-threatening diseases or chronic debilitating conditions.
    Building on our growing knowledge of the biology underlying
    hematological and solid tumor cancers as well as in
    immune-inflammatory diseases, we are investing in a range of
    innovative therapeutic programs that are investigating ways to
    treat and manage chronic diseases by targeting the disease
    source through multiple mechanisms of action.

Our primary commercial stage products include
    REVLIMID   ,

    VIDAZA   ,

    THALOMID   

    (inclusive of Thalidomide
    Celgene   

    and Thalidomide
    Pharmion   ),

    ABRAXANE   ,

    which was obtained in the October 2010 acquisition of Abraxis
    BioScience, Inc., or Abraxis, and
    ISTODAX   ,

    which was obtained in the January 2010 acquisition of Gloucester
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Gloucester. Additional sources of
    revenue include sales of
    FOCALIN   

    exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, a licensing
    agreement with Novartis, which entitles us to royalties on
    FOCALIN
    XR   

    and the entire
    RITALIN   

    family of drugs, residual royalty payments from GlaxoSmithKline,
    or GSK, based upon GSK s
    ALKERAN   

    revenues through the end of March 2011, sale of services through
    our Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary and other miscellaneous
    licensing agreements.

In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and, in July
    1987, completed an initial public offering. Our initial
    operations focused on the research and development of chemical
    and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical
    industries. We subsequently completed the following strategic
    acquisitions that strengthened our research and manufacturing
    capabilities in addition to enhancing our commercialized
    products:

In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
    currently Signal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a privately held
    biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and
    development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease.

In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., a privately
    held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood
    banking business, developing technologies for the recovery of
    stem cells from human placental tissues following the completion
    of full-term, successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis d/b/a
    Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now operates as our
    wholly owned subsidiary engaged in the research, recovery,
    culture-expansion, preservation, development and distribution of
    placental cells, including stem and progenitor cells, as
    therapeutic agents.

In March 2008, we acquired Pharmion Corporation, or Pharmion, a
    global biopharmaceutical company that acquired, developed and
    commercialized innovative products for the treatment of
    hematology and oncology patients. Pharmion was acquired to
    enhance our portfolio of therapies for patients with
    life-threatening illnesses worldwide with the addition of
    Pharmion s marketed products, and several products in
    development for the treatment of hematological and solid tumor
    cancers. By combining this new product portfolio with our
    existing operational and financial capabilities, we enlarged our
    global market share through increased product offerings and
    expanded clinical, regulatory and commercial capabilities.

In January 2010, we acquired Gloucester, a privately held
    pharmaceutical company which developed new therapies that
    address unmet medical needs in the treatment of hematological
    cancers, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL,
    peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, and other hematological
    malignancies. Gloucester was acquired to advance our leadership
    position in the development of disease-altering therapies
    through innovative approaches for patients with rare and
    debilitating blood cancers.

In October 2010, we acquired Abraxis, a fully integrated global
    biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery, development
    and delivery of next-generation therapeutics and core
    technologies that offer patients treatments for cancer and other
    critical illnesses. The acquisition of Abraxis accelerates our
    strategy

to become a global leader in oncology and adds
    ABRAXANE   ,

    which is based on Abraxis  proprietary tumor-targeting
    platform known as
    nab   

    technology, to our existing portfolio of leading cancer products.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reported revenue
    of $3.626 billion, net income of $880.5 million and
    diluted earnings per share of $1.88. Revenue increased by
    $935.9 million in 2010 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2009 primarily due to our continuing expansion
    into international markets, growth of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   

    in both U.S. and international markets and the inclusion of
    sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    and
    ISTODAX   

    subsequent to the acquisition dates of Abraxis and Gloucester,
    respectively. Net income and earnings per share for 2010 reflect
    the earnings contributions from a higher sales level, partly
    offset by increased spending for new product launches, research
    and development, expansion of our international operations and
    additional costs related to the acquisitions of Gloucester and
    Abraxis.

Our future growth and operating results will depend on the
    continued acceptance of our marketed products, future regulatory
    approvals and successful commercialization of new products and
    new product indications, depth of our product pipeline,
    competition with our marketed products and challenges to our
    intellectual property. See also Forward-Looking Statements and
    Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A of this
    Annual Report on
     Form 10-K.

PRECLINICAL
    AND CLINICAL   STAGE PIPELINE  

Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug
    candidates and cell therapies, is highlighted by multiple
    classes of small molecule, orally administered therapeutic
    agents designed to selectively regulate disease-associated genes
    and proteins. The product candidates in our pipeline are at
    various stages of preclinical and clinical development.
    Successful results in preclinical or Phase I/II clinical studies
    may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or
    effectiveness of a drug or product candidate.

Phase I Clinical Trials  

Phase I human clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies
    allow a request to initiate clinical investigations of a new
    drug or product candidate to become effective and usually
    involve between 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or patients. The
    tests study a drug s safety profile, and may include
    preliminary determination of a drug or product candidate s
    safe dosage range. The Phase I clinical studies also determine
    how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by
    the body, and therefore potentially the duration of its action.

Phase II Clinical Trials  

Phase II clinical trials are conducted on a limited number
    of patients with the targeted disease. An initial evaluation of
    the drug s effectiveness on patients is performed and
    additional information on the drug s safety and dosage
    range is obtained.

Phase III Clinical Trials  

Phase III clinical trials typically include controlled
    multi-center trials and involve a larger target patient
    population to ensure that study results are statistically
    significant. During Phase III clinical trials, physicians
    monitor patients to determine efficacy and to gather further
    information on safety.

Pomalidomide:    Pomalidomide is an
    IMiD   

    drug, a proprietary, novel, small molecule that is orally
    available and modulates the immune system and other biologically
    important targets. Pomalidomide is being evaluated in a
    Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of
    myelofibrosis. A Phase III clinical trial is being planned
    to evaluate pomalidomide as a treatment for patients with
    relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

Additional
    IMiDs   

    compounds are in preclinical development. Our
    IMiDs   

    compounds are covered by an extensive and comprehensive
    intellectual property estate of U.S. and foreign-issued
    patents and pending patent applications including
     composition-of-matter, 
    use and other patents and patent applications.

ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS:    Our oral
    pluripotent immunomodulators are members of a proprietary
    pipeline of novel small molecules with anti-inflammatory
    activities that impede the production of multiple
    proinflammatory mediators by inhibiting PDE-4, also causing
    reductions in TNF-  as well as interleukin-8, or IL-8,
    IL-17 and IL-23, interferon-gamma, leukotrienes and nitric oxide
    synthase and it up regulates IL-10. Apremilast is our lead
    investigational drug in this class of anti-inflammatory
    compounds and is currently being evaluated as a potential
    therapy for patients with
     moderate-to-severe 
    psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis as well as rheumatoid
    arthritis in six Phase III clinical trials. We are also
    exploring the use of apremilast in additional rheumatic,
    dermatologic and inflammatory diseases to determine its
    potential. In addition, we are investigating our next generation
    oral pluripotent immunomodulator, CC-11050, which has completed
    Phase I trials, towards evaluating its safety and efficacy in a
    number of inflammatory conditions and are moving forward with
    its development.

KINASE INHIBITORS:    We have generated
    valuable intellectual property in the identification of multiple
    kinases that regulate pathways critical in inflammation and
    oncology. Our oral kinase inhibitor platform includes inhibitors
    of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK, mTOR kinase, spleen
    tyrosine kinase, or Syk,
     c-fms 
    tyrosine kinase, or
     c-FMS,  and
    DNA-dependent protein kinase, or DNAPK. Our oral Syk,
     c-FMS  and
    DNAPK kinase inhibitors are being investigated in pre-clinical
    studies and targeting human trials in 2012. Our oral JNK
    inhibitor, CC-401, has successfully completed a Phase I trial in
    healthy volunteers and in AML patients to determine safety and
    tolerability. No further studies with CC-401 are planned at this
    time as we intend to advance our new second generation JNK
    inhibitors, specifically CC-930, which recently completed a
    Phase Ib multiple dose study. We are also planning to
    investigate CC-930 in fibrotic conditions assuming safety and
    tolerability continue to be acceptable.

SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER:    Amrubicin is a
    third-generation fully synthetic anthracycline molecule with
    potent topoisomerase II inhibition and is currently being
    studied as a single agent and in combination with anti-cancer
    therapies for solid tumors. In 2008, the FDA granted amrubicin
    orphan drug designation for the treatment of small cell lung
    cancer and fast track product designation for the treatment of
    small cell lung cancer after first-line chemotherapy. A drug
    designated as a fast track product is intended for the treatment
    of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the
    potential to provide a therapy where none exists or provide a
    therapy which may offer a significant improvement in safety
     and/or 
    effectiveness over existing therapy.

ABI COMPOUNDS:    ABI compounds are
    targeted nanoparticle, albumin-bound compounds being
    investigated for potential treatment of solid tumor cancers.
    These compounds include: ABI-008
    (nab   

    -docetaxel), which is in a Phase II trial for hormone
    refractory prostate cancer; ABI-009
    (nab   

    -rapamycin), which is an mTOR inhibitor currently in a Phase I
    trial in patients with solid tumors; ABI-010
    (nab   

    -17AAG), which is an Hsp90 inhibitor that completed pre-clinical
    analysis and the initial new drug application, or IND, was
    approved by the FDA in May 2008; and ABI-011
    (nab   

    -thiocolchicine dimer), which is a novel thiocolchicine with
    dual mechanisms of action showing both microtubule
    destabilization and the disruption of topoisomerase-1 activity.
    An IND was filed in the third quarter of 2009.

COROXANE     tm    

     (nanometer-sized paclitaxel,
    ABRAXANE   ,

    under the trade name
    COROXANE   tm   ):    COROXANE  tm  

    is currently closing its Phase II clinical studies for
    coronary restenosis as well as peripheral artery (superficial
    femoral artery) restenosis. The SNAPIST series of studies
    examines the use of
    COROXANE  tm  

    in the treatment of coronary artery restenosis, including the
    use of
    COROXANE  tm  

    in patients receiving bare metal stents.
    COROXANE  tm  ,

    administered with bare metal stents may address the issue of
    incomplete re-endothelialization and acute thrombosis associated
    with drug-eluting stents.
    COROXANE  tm  

    administered following balloon angioplasty in the superficial
    femoral artery may help reduce the incidence of restenosis in
    these patients. We currently intend to seek a strategic partner
    for the further development and marketing of
    COROXANE  tm  .

CELLULAR THERAPIES:    At CCT, we are
    researching stem cells derived from the human placenta as well
    as from the umbilical cord. CCT is our
     state-of-the-art 
    research and development division dedicated to fulfilling the

5

Table of Contents   

promise of cellular technologies by developing cutting-edge
    products and therapies to significantly benefit patients. Our
    goal is to develop proprietary cell therapy products for the
    treatment of unmet medical needs.

Stem cell based therapies offer the potential to provide
    disease-modifying outcomes for serious diseases which lack
    adequate therapy. We have developed proprietary technology for
    collecting, processing and storing placental stem cells with
    potentially broad therapeutic applications in cancer,
    auto-immune diseases including Crohn s disease and multiple
    sclerosis, neurological disorders including stroke and
    amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, graft-versus-host
    disease, or GVHD, and other
    immunological / anti-inflammatory, rheumatologic and
    bone disorders. We have initiated Phase II studies for our
    human placenta derived cell product, PDA-001, to evaluate
    PDA-001 as a potential treatment for patients with
     moderate-to-severe 
    Crohn s disease refractory to oral corticosteroids and
    immune suppressants, patients with multiple sclerosis, and
    patients with stroke or rheumatoid arthritis.

We also maintain an IND with the FDA for a trial with human
    umbilical cord blood in sickle cell anemia and an IND for human
    placental-derived stem cells, or HPDSC, to support a study to
    assess the safety of its transplantation with umbilical cord
    blood stem cells, obtained from fully or partially matched
    related donors in subjects with certain malignant hematological
    diseases and non-malignant disorders. We are continuing
    additional preclinical and clinical research to define further
    the potential of placental-derived stem cells and to
    characterize other placental-derived products.

SOTATERCEPT (ACE-011):    We have a
    collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron, to develop
    sotatercept. Sotatercept acts as a decoy receptor for members of
    the growth and differentiation factor, or GDF, family of ligands
    that bind the ACTIIRB receptor, with highest affinity for
    Activin A and B. Two Phase I clinical studies have been
    completed (A011-01 and A011-02); and two Phase II studies
    (A011-04 and A011-08) are closed and awaiting completion of the
    clinical study report. Three additional Phase II clinical
    studies have been initiated and are currently ongoing
    (A011-REN-001 in end stage renal anemia, A011-NSCL-001 for
    chemotherapy-induced anemia in non-small cell lung cancer, or
    NSCLC, patients and A011-ST-001 to evaluate effects on red blood
    cell mass and plasma volume).

PATENTS
    AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY  

We consider intellectual property protection (including but not
    limited to patents and regulatory exclusivities) relative to
    certain products- particularly those products discussed below-
    to be critical to our operations. For many of our products, in
    addition to compound patents we hold other patents on
    manufacturing processes, formulations, or uses that may extend
    exclusivity beyond the expiration of the product patent.

KEY
    PRODUCTS: TABLE OF EXCLUSIVITIES  

The following table shows the estimated expiration dates in the
    United States and in Europe of the
     last-to-expire 
    period of exclusivity (regulatory or patent) related to the
    following approved drugs:

In the United States, the patents covering the
    REVLIMID   

    brand drug include thirteen (13) patents that are listed in
    the Orange Book, all of which are assigned to us. The
     last-to-expire 
    patent (2026), U.S. Patent No. 7,465,800, covers
    certain polymorphic forms of the pharmaceutically active
    ingredient of
    REVLIMID   

    brand drug.

REVLIMID   

    brand drug is also covered in foreign countries by patents and
    patent applications that are equivalent to those listed in the
    U.S. Orange Book. For example, patents related to the
    active pharmaceutical ingredient, uses and pharmaceutical
    compositions are granted in Europe. The patents are currently
    scheduled to expire in 2017 or 2018, except that patents granted
    in certain European countries such as, for example, Spain,
    France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom will not expire
    until 2022 due to the supplementary protection certificates, or
    SPCs, granted in these countries. In addition, patents in Europe
    that relate to uses of and products comprising lenalidomide
    relative to multiple myeloma will not expire until 2023.

The patents covering
    THALOMID   

    brand drug in the United States include thirteen
    (13) patents that are listed in the Orange Book. The
     last-to-expire 
    patent (2023), U.S. Patent No. 7,230,012, that is
    assigned to us, covers marketed
    THALOMID   

    formulations.

In foreign countries,
    THALOMID   

    brand drug is also covered by patents and patent applications
    that are equivalent to those listed in the U.S. Orange
    Book. Patents related to the approved uses of thalidomide are
    granted in Europe. The patents are currently scheduled to expire
    in 2014 or 2017, except that patents granted in certain European
    countries, such as for example, Spain, France and Italy, will
    not expire until 2019 due to the SPCs granted in these countries.

Exclusivity with respect to the currently approved formulation
    for
    VIDAZA   

    brand drug stems from regulatory mechanisms. In the United
    States, orphan drug exclusivity with respect to
    VIDAZA   

    brand drug expires in May 2011. In Europe, new drug and orphan
    exclusivities relative to
    VIDAZA   

    brand drug expire in December 2018.

The patents covering
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug in the United States include eight (8) patents
    that are listed in the Orange Book. The
     last-to-expire 
    patent (2024), U.S. Patent No. 7,820,788, covers
    marketed
    ABRAXANE   

    formulations. In Europe, new drug exclusivity relative to
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug expires in 2018. We have applied for Supplementary
    Protection Certificates in Europe relative to EP 0 961 612 B1
    that, if granted, would

8

Table of Contents   

extend exclusivity for
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug to 2022. EP 0 961 612 B1 presently is under
    opposition at the European Patent Office by Teva Pharmaceutical
    Industries Ltd.

Our acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals Inc. included the
    acquisition of certain intellectual properties relative to
    ISTODAX   

    brand drug. United States Patent No. 4,977,138 is presently
    estimated to expire on July 6, 2011. The remaining two
    patents, related to alternate forms of the active pharmaceutical
    ingredient of
    ISTODAX   

    brand drug, expire on the same date: August 22, 2021.

In the United States, the patents covering
    FOCALIN   

    brand drug include three (3) patents that are listed in the
    Orange Book. All of these patents are assigned to us. These
    patents all expire on the same date: December 4, 2015.

In the United States, the patents covering FOCALIN
    XR   

    brand drug comprise six (6) patents that are listed in the
    Orange Book. All of these six (6) patents are assigned to
    us. These patents all expire on the same date: December 4,
    2015. A relevant European patent, owned by us, expires on
    June 9, 2018.

In the United States, the patents covering RITALIN
    LA   

    brand drug comprise three (3) patents that are listed in
    the Orange Book. All of these three (3) patents are
    assigned to us. These patents all expire on the same date:
    December 4, 2015. A relevant European patent, owned by us,
    expires on June 9, 2018.

In terms of our United States patents for
    FOCALIN   ,

    FOCALIN
    XR   

    and RITALIN
    LA   

    brand drugs, the previously disclosed litigations with generic
    drug companies (i.e. TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,
    IntelliPharmaCeutics Corp., Actavis South Atlantic LLC, Abrika
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Barr Pharmaceutical, Inc. and KV
    Pharmaceutical Company), see annual report on
     Form 10-K 
    filed on February 18, 2010, were resolved pursuant to
    confidential settlements which do allow for the entrance of
    their respective generic products in the United States prior to
    the 2015 patent expirations, should their respective ANDA
    applications have FDA approval.

As noted above, patent protection is very important to us and
    our business and, therefore, we have applied for and received
    SPCs in Europe relative to certain in-licensed CMCC thalidomide
    patents. These SPCs, reflected in the chart above, extend the
    terms of these patents relative to certain uses of thalidomide
    to 2019. In addition, also as reflected in the chart above, we
    have applied for and received SPCs to 2022 in Europe relative to
    lenalidomide. In the United States, we have been granted a
    patent term extension of our
    REVLIMID   

    composition of matter patent to 2019. By way of further example,
    in the United States, and as reflected in the chart above, we
    have been granted patent term adjustment with respect to a
    REVLIMID   

    polymorph patent; this patent is presently scheduled to expire
    in 2026.

Patent term extensions have been granted in other markets as
    well including Australia and Korea relative to certain of our
    patents claiming lenalidomide. Patent term extension
    applications relative to lenalidomide also are pending in Japan.
    In addition, we have actively considered and may pursue
    alternate exclusivity strategies, mostly related to
    international treaties, in a variety of countries throughout
    Latin America.

Trade secret strategies also are integral to our success. There
    exist certain trade secrets related to many of our key products,
    including
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug.

Our brand names, logos and trademarks are also important to us
    and in the aggregate important to our success. We maintain both
    registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark
    protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark
    is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as
    long as the trademark is registered,

In total, we own or have exclusively licensed over 280 issued
    U.S. patents. In addition, approximately 310 additional
    pending patent applications are owned by or exclusively licensed
    to us. We have a policy to seek worldwide patent protection for
    our inventions and have foreign patent rights corresponding to
    most of our U.S. patents.

In August 2001, we entered into an agreement, termed the
     New Thalidomide Agreement,  with EntreMed, Inc., or
    EntreMed, Children s Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC,
    and Bioventure Investments kft relating to patents and patent
    applications owned by CMCC, which agreement superceded several
    agreements already in place between CMCC, EntreMed and us.
    Pursuant to the New Thalidomide Agreement, CMCC directly granted
    to us an exclusive worldwide license under the relevant patents
    and patent applications relating to thalidomide. Several
    U.S. and European patents have been issued to CMCC in this
    patent family and certain of these patents expire in 2013 and
    2014. We have applied for and received Supplementary Protection
    Certificates, or SPCs, in Europe

9

Table of Contents   

relative to certain of these issued CMCC thalidomide patents.
    These SPCs extend the terms of these patents relative to uses of
    thalidomide to 2019. Corresponding foreign patent applications
    and additional U.S. patent applications are still pending.

In addition to the New Thalidomide Agreement, we entered into an
    agreement, entitled the  New Analog Agreement,  with
    CMCC and EntreMed in December 2002, pursuant to which we have
    been granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain CMCC
    patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide analogs.
    Under the New Analog Agreement, CMCC exclusively licensed to us
    these patents and patent applications, which relate to analogs,
    metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide,
    and stereoisomers thereof. Under the New Analog Agreement, we
    are obligated to comply with certain milestones and other
    obligations, including those relating to
    REVLIMID   

    brand drug sales. The New Analog Agreement grants us control
    over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed thalidomide
    analog patent rights.

Our research leads us to seek patent protection for molecular
    targets and drug discovery technologies, as well as therapeutic
    and diagnostic products and processes. More specifically,
    proprietary technology has been developed for use in molecular
    target discovery, the identification of regulatory pathways in
    cells, assay design and the discovery and development of
    pharmaceutical product candidates. An increasing percentage of
    our recent patent applications have been related to potential
    product candidates or compounds. As of December 2010, included
    in those inventions described above, we owned, in whole or in
    part, over 100 issued U.S. patents and have filed over 110
    U.S. pending patent applications, including pending
    provisional applications, some of which are related to sponsored
    or collaborative research relationships.

CCT, our cellular therapeutics subsidiary, seeks patent
    protection for the collection, processing, composition,
    formulation and uses of mammalian placental and umbilical cord
    tissue and placental and umbilical cord stem cells, as well as
    cells and biomaterials derived from the placenta. As of December
    2010, CCT owned, in whole or in part, 10 U.S. patents,
    including claims to novel cells and cellular compositions. In
    addition, CCT has approximately 60 U.S. patent
    applications, including pending provisional applications.

Our patents are regularly subject to challenge by generic drug
    companies and manufacturers. See Part I, Item 3,
     Legal Proceedings.  We rely on several different
    types of patents to protect our products, including, without
    limitation, compound, polymorph, formulation and method of use
    patents. We do not know whether any of these patents will be
    circumvented, invalidated or found unenforceable as a result of
    challenge by generic companies or manufacturers. For a more
    detailed discussion of risks related to our patent portfolio see
    Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors. 

GOVERNMENTAL
    REGULATION/EXCLUSIVITIES AFFORDED BY REGULATORY
    AUTHORITIES  

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and
    other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and
    marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and
    development activities. Most, if not all, of our therapeutic
    products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies
    prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic
    products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and
    clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by
    the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the
    United States, various federal and, in some cases, state
    statutes and regulations also govern or impact upon the
    manufacturing, testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling,
    storage, record-keeping and marketing of such products. The
    lengthy process of seeking required approvals, and the
    continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and
    regulations, requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
    Regulatory approval, if and when obtained, may be limited in
    scope which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which
    a product may be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as
    their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review and discovery
    of previously unknown problems with such products or the
    manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their
    production may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale
    or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure by
    us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or
    licensees to obtain or maintain, or any delay in obtaining,
    regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our
    products and our ability to receive product revenue, license
    revenue or profit sharing payments.

The activities required before a product may be marketed in the
    United States begin with preclinical testing not involving human
    subjects. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a
    product candidate s chemistry and its

10

Table of Contents   

biological activities and the conduct of animal studies to
    assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate
    and its formulations. The results of these studies must be
    submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must be reviewed by
    the FDA primarily for safety considerations before proposed
    clinical trials in humans can begin.

Typically, clinical trials involve a three-phase process as
    previously described. In some cases, further studies (Phase
    IV) are required as a condition for a new drug application,
    or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, approval, to
    provide additional information concerning the drug or product.
    The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials,
    and reports of all adverse events must be made to the agency
    before drug approval. After approval, we have ongoing reporting
    obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the
    drug, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected
    adverse events. Additionally, we may have limited control over
    studies conducted with our proprietary compounds or biologics if
    such studies are performed by others (e.g., cooperative groups).

The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are
    submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA for evaluation to
    determine if the product is sufficiently safe and effective for
    approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA
    or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional
    information or deny the application if it determines that the
    application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria.
    When an NDA or BLA is approved, the NDA or BLA holder must
    a) employ a system for obtaining reports of experience and
    side effects associated with the drug and make appropriate
    submissions to the FDA and b) timely advise the FDA if any
    marketed product fails to adhere to specifications established
    by the NDA or BLA internal manufacturing procedures.

Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the
    FDA designate a drug intended to treat a  rare disease or
    condition  as an  orphan drug.  The term
     orphan drug  can refer to either a drug or biologic.
    A rare disease or condition is defined as one which affects less
    than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects
    more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of
    developing and making available the product is not expected to
    be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
    Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated
    as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of
    that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive
    marketing rights in the United States for such drug or product
    containing the active ingredient for the same indication unless
    the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient
    quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the
    disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the
    approved indication and does not prevent another company from
    seeking approval of other labeled indications. The period of
    orphan exclusivity is concurrent with any patent exclusivity
    that relates to the drug or biologic. Orphan drugs may also be
    eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated
    with the drugs  development. Possible amendment of the
    Orphan Drug Act by the U.S. Congress and possible
    reinterpretation by the FDA has been discussed by regulators and
    legislators. FDA regulations reflecting certain definitions,
    limitations and procedures for orphan drugs initially went into
    effect in January 1993 and were amended in certain respects in
    1998. Therefore, there is no assurance as to the precise scope
    of protection that may be afforded by orphan drug status in the
    future or that the current level of exclusivity and tax credits
    will remain in effect. Moreover, even if we have an orphan drug
    designation for a particular use of a drug, there can be no
    assurance that another company also holding orphan drug
    designation will not receive approval prior to us for the same
    indication. If that were to happen, our applications for that
    indication could not be approved until the competing
    company s seven-year period of exclusivity expired. Even if
    we are the first to obtain approval for the orphan drug
    indication, there are certain circumstances under which a
    competing product may be approved for the same indication during
    our seven-year period of exclusivity. Further, particularly in
    the case of large molecule drugs or biologics, a question can be
    raised whether the competing product is really the  same
    drug  as that which was approved. In addition, even in
    cases in which two products appear to be the same drug, the
    agency may approve the second product based on a showing of
    clinical superiority compared to the first product. In order to
    increase the development and marketing of drugs for rare
    disorders, regulatory bodies outside the United States have
    enacted regulations similar to the Orphan Drug Act.
    REVLIMID   

    brand drug has been granted orphan medicinal product designation
    by the European Commission, or EC, for treatment of CLL
    following the favorable opinion of the European Medicines
    Agency s, or EMA, Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.

Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement
    that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and
    manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDA s
    current Good Manufacturing

11

Table of Contents   

Practice, or cGMP, regulations (which are regulations
    established by the FDA governing the manufacture, processing,
    packing, storage and testing of drugs and biologics intended for
    human use). In complying with cGMP, manufacturers must devote
    extensive time, money and effort in the area of production and
    quality control and quality assurance to maintain full technical
    compliance. Manufacturing facilities and company records are
    subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance.
    If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance
    with these requirements, regulatory enforcement action may be
    taken by the FDA, which may include seeking an injunction
    against shipment of products from the facility and recall of
    products previously shipped from the facility.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act, or the Act, products covered by approved NDAs or
    supplemental NDAs may be protected by periods of patent
     and/or 
    non-patent exclusivity. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA
    is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an
    abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Further, NDAs submitted under
    505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act may not reference
    data contained in the NDA for a product protected by an
    effective and unexpired exclusivity. ANDAs and 505(b)(2)
    applications are generally less burdensome than full NDAs in
    that, in lieu of new clinical data, the applications rely in
    whole, or in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings of the
    referenced approved drug in conjunction with bridging data,
    typically bioequivalence data. Upon the expiration of the
    applicable exclusivities, through passage of time or successful
    legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective approval of an ANDA
    for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a previously
    protected NDA in a 505(b)(2) application. Depending upon the
    scope of the applicable exclusivities, any such approval could
    be limited to certain formulations
     and/or 
    indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding
    exclusivities. While the Act provides for ANDA and 505(b)(2)
    abbreviated approval pathways for drugs earlier submitted as
    NDAs and approved under section 505 of the Act, there are
    presently no similar provisions for biologics submitted as BLAs
    and approved under the Public Health Service, or PHS, Act. There
    is currently no abbreviated application that would permit
    approval of a generic or  follow-on  biologic based on
    the FDA s earlier approval of another manufacturer s
    application under section 351 of the PHS Act.

Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements
    can result in enforcement actions such as warning letters,
    recalls or adverse publicity issued by the FDA or in legal
    actions such as seizures, injunctions, fines based on the
    equitable remedy of disgorgement, restitution and criminal
    prosecution.

Approval procedures similar to those in the United States must
    be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the
    market for our products before any such product can be
    commercialized in those countries. The approval procedure and
    the time required for approval vary from country to country and
    may involve additional testing. There can be no assurance that
    approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all. In
    addition, regulatory approval of drug and biologics pricing is
    required in most countries other than the United States. There
    can be no assurance that the resulting pricing of our products
    would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.

COMPETITION  

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are each highly
    competitive. We also compete with universities and research
    institutions in the development of products and processes, and
    in the acquisition of technology from outside sources.

Competition in the pharmaceutical industry, and specifically in
    the oncology and immune-inflammatory areas, is particularly
    intense. Numerous pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug
    companies have extensive anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug
    discovery, development and commercial resources. Abbott
    Laboratories, Amgen Inc., or Amgen, AstraZeneca PLC., Biogen
    Idec Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Eisai Co., Ltd.,
    F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., Johnson and Johnson, Merck and
    Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis and Takeda
    Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Takeda, are among some of the
    companies researching and developing new compounds in the
    oncology, inflammation and immunology fields. We, along with
    other pharmaceutical brand-name makers, face the challenges
    brought on by generic drug manufacturers in their pursuit of
    obtaining bulk quantities of certain drugs in order for them to
    be able to develop similar versions of these products and be
    ready to market as soon as permitted.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have undergone,
    and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant
    technological change. Consolidation and competition are expected
    to intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved
    and become more widely known. In order to compete effectively,
    we will be required to continually upgrade and expand our
    scientific expertise and technology, identify and retain capable
    personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and commercially
    viable opportunities.

Our competition will be determined in part by the indications
    and geographic markets for which our products are developed and
    ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The relative
    speed with which we develop new products, complete clinical
    trials, obtain regulatory approvals, receive pricing and
    reimbursement approvals, finalize agreements with outside
    contract manufacturers when needed and market our products are
    critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage. Competition
    among products approved for sale includes product efficacy,
    safety, convenience, reliability, availability, price,
    third-party reimbursement and patent and non-patent exclusivity.

SIGNIFICANT
    ALLIANCES  

We have entered into a variety of alliances as is customary in
    our industry. Following is a description of the major agreements
    in place:

Novartis Pharma AG:   We entered into an
    agreement with Novartis in which we granted to Novartis an
    exclusive worldwide license (excluding Canada) to develop and
    market
    FOCALIN   

    (d-methylphenidate, or d -MPH) and FOCALIN
    XR   ,

    the long-acting drug formulation for attention deficit disorder,
    or ADD, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
    We also granted Novartis rights to all of our related
    intellectual property and patents, including formulations of the
    currently marketed RITALIN
    LA   .

    Under the agreement, we are entitled to receive up to
    $100.0 million in upfront and regulatory achievement
    milestone payments. To date, we have received upfront and
    regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling
    $55.0 million. We also sell
    FOCALIN   

    to Novartis and currently receive royalties of between 35% and
    30% on sales of all of Novartis  FOCALIN
    XR   

    and
    RITALIN   

    family of ADHD-related products.

The agreement will continue until the later of (i) the
    tenth anniversary of the first commercial launch on a
     country-by-country 
    basis or (ii) when the last applicable patent expires with
    respect to that country. At the expiration date, we shall grant
    Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to
    make, have made, use, import and sell d-MPH and
    Ritalin   

    under our technology.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

i. Novartis at its sole discretion, effective
    12 months after written notice to us, or

ii. by:

a. either party if the other party materially breaches any
    of its material obligations under the agreement,

b. us if Novartis fails to pay amounts due under the
    agreement two or more times in a
     12-month 
    period,

c. either party, on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis, in the event of withdrawal of the d-MPH product or
    Ritalin   

    product from the market because of regulatory mandate,

d. either party if the other party files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by us then all licenses granted
    to Novartis under the agreement will terminate and Novartis will
    also grant us a non-exclusive license to certain of their
    intellectual property related to the compounds and products.

If the agreement is terminated by Novartis then all licenses
    granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate.

If the agreement is terminated by Novartis because of a material
    breach by us, then Novartis can make a claim for damages against
    us and we shall grant Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive,
    royalty-free license to make, have made, use, import and sell
    d-MPH and
    Ritalin   

    under our technology.

Table of Contents   

When generic versions of long-acting methylphenidate
    hydrochloride and dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride enter the
    market, we expect Novartis  sales of Ritalin
    LA   

    and Focalin
    XR   

    products to decrease and therefore our royalties under this
    agreement to also decrease.

Array BioPharma Inc.:   We have a research
    collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma Inc., or Array,
    focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of
    novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation. As part of this
    agreement, we made an upfront payment in September 2007 to Array
    of $40.0 million, which was recorded as research and
    development expense, in return for an option to receive
    exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against two
    of the four research targets defined in the agreement, except
    for Array s limited U.S. co-promotional rights. In
    June 2009, we made an additional upfront payment of
    $4.5 million to expand the research targets defined in the
    agreement, which was recorded as research and development
    expense. Array will be responsible for all discovery and
    clinical development through Phase I or Phase IIa and be
    entitled to receive, for each compound, potential milestone
    payments of approximately $200.0 million if certain
    discovery, development and regulatory milestones are achieved,
    and $300.0 million if certain commercial milestones are
    achieved as well as royalties on net sales. During the fourth
    quarter of 2010, we made a $10.0 million discovery
    milestone payment required by the collaboration upon the filing
    and clearance of an IND with the FDA.

Our option will terminate upon the earlier of either a
    termination of the agreement, the date we have exercised our
    options for compounds developed against two of the four research
    targets defined in the agreement, or September 21, 2012,
    unless the term is extended. We may unilaterally extend the
    option term for two additional one-year terms until
    September 21, 2014 and the parties may mutually extend the
    term for two additional one-year terms until September 21,
    2016. Upon exercise of an option, the agreement will continue
    until we have satisfied all royalty payment obligations to
    Array. Upon the expiration of the agreement, Array will grant us
    a fully
     paid-up, 
    royalty-free license to use certain intellectual property of
    Array to market and sell the compounds and products developed
    under the agreement. The agreement may expire on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect
    to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

(i) us at our sole discretion, or

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches any of its material obligations
    under the agreement, or

b. files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or
    by Array for a material breach by us, then our rights to the
    compounds and products developed under the agreement will revert
    to Array. If the agreement is terminated by Array for a material
    breach by us, then we will also grant to Array a non-exclusive,
    royalty-free license to certain intellectual property controlled
    by us necessary to continue the development of such compounds
    and products. If the agreement is terminated by us for a
    material breach by Array, then, among other things, our payment
    obligations under the agreement could be either reduced by 50%
    or terminated entirely.

Acceleron Pharma:   We have a worldwide
    strategic collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron, for
    the joint development and commercialization of ACE-011,
    currently being studied for treatment of chemotherapy-induced
    anemia, metastatic bone disease and renal anemia. The
    collaboration combines both companies  resources and
    commitment to developing products for the treatment of cancer
    and cancer-related bone loss. The agreement also includes an
    option for certain discovery stage programs. Under the terms of
    the agreement, we and Acceleron will jointly develop,
    manufacture and commercialize Acceleron s products for bone
    loss. We made an upfront payment to Acceleron in February 2008
    of $50.0 million, which included a $5.0 million equity
    investment in Acceleron, with the remainder recorded as research
    and development expense. In addition, in the event of an initial
    public offering of Acceleron, we will purchase a minimum of
    $7.0 million of Acceleron common stock.

Acceleron will retain responsibility for initial activities,
    including research and development, through the end of Phase IIa
    clinical trials, as well as manufacturing the clinical supplies
    for these studies. In turn, we will conduct the Phase IIb and
    Phase III clinical studies and will oversee the manufacture
    of Phase III and commercial supplies. Acceleron will pay a
    share of the development expenses and is eligible to receive
    development, regulatory approval

14

Table of Contents   

and sales-based milestones of up to $510.0 million for the
    ACE-011 program and up to an additional $437.0 million for
    each of the three discovery stage programs. The companies will
    co-promote the products in North America. Acceleron will receive
    tiered royalties on worldwide net sales, upon the
    commercialization of a development compound.

The agreement will continue until we have satisfied all royalty
    payment obligations to Acceleron and we have either exercised or
    forfeited all of our options under the agreement. Upon our full
    satisfaction of our royalty payment obligations to Acceleron
    under the agreement, all licenses granted to us by Acceleron
    under the agreement will become fully
     paid-up, 
    perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable and royalty-free licenses.
    The agreement may expire on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect
    to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

(i) us at our sole discretion, or

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches any of its material obligations
    under the agreement, or

b. files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or
    by Acceleron for a material breach by us, then all licenses
    granted to us under the agreement will terminate and we will
    also grant to Acceleron a non-exclusive license to certain of
    our intellectual property related to the compounds and products.
    If the agreement is terminated by us for a material breach by
    Acceleron, then, among other things, (A) the licenses
    granted to Acceleron under the agreement will terminate,
    (B) the licenses granted to us will continue in perpetuity,
    (C) all future royalties payable by us under the agreement
    will be reduced by 50% and (D) our obligation to make any
    future milestone payments will terminate.

Cabrellis Pharmaceuticals Corp.:   We, as a
    result of our acquisition of Pharmion, obtained an exclusive
    license to develop and commercialize amrubicin in North America
    and Europe pursuant to a license agreement with Dainippon
    Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd, or DSP. Pursuant to Pharmion s
    acquisition of Cabrellis Pharmaceutics Corp., or Cabrellis,
    prior to our acquisition of Pharmion, we will pay
    $12.5 million for each approval of amrubicin in an initial
    indication by regulatory authorities in the United States and
    the E.U. to the former shareholders of Cabrellis. Upon approval
    of amrubicin for a second indication in the United States or the
    E.U., we will pay an additional $10.0 million for each
    market to the former shareholders of Cabrellis. Under the terms
    of the license agreement for amrubicin, we are required to make
    milestone payments of $7.0 million and $1.0 million to
    DSP upon regulatory approval of amrubicin in the United States
    and upon receipt of the first approval in the E.U.,
    respectively, and up to $17.5 million upon achieving
    certain annual sales levels in the United States. Pursuant to
    the supply agreement for amrubicin, we are to pay DSP a
    semiannual supply price calculated as a percentage of net sales
    for a period of ten years. In September 2008, amrubicin was
    granted fast-track product designation by the FDA for the
    treatment of small cell lung cancer after first-line
    chemotherapy.

The amrubicin license expires on a
     country-by-country 
    basis and on a
     product-by-product 
    basis upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the
    first commercial sale of the applicable product in a given
    country after the issuance of marketing authorization in such
    country and (ii) the first day of the first quarter for
    which the total number of generic product units sold in a given
    country exceeds 20% of the total number of generic product units
    sold plus licensed product units sold in the relevant country
    during the same calendar quarter.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the amrubicin
    license may be terminated by:

(i) us at our sole discretion,

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches any of its material obligations
    under the agreement, or

b. files for bankruptcy,

(iii) DSP if we take any action to challenge the title or
    validity of the patents owned by DSP, or

(iv) DSP in the event of our change in control.

15

Table of Contents   

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or
    by DSP under circumstances described in clauses (ii)(a) and
    (iii) above, then we will transfer our rights to the
    compounds and products developed under the agreement to DSP and
    will also grant to DSP a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free
    license to certain intellectual property controlled by us
    necessary to continue the development of such compounds and
    products. If the agreement is terminated by us for a material
    breach by DSP, then, among other things, DSP will grant to us an
    exclusive, perpetual,
     paid-up 
    license to all of the intellectual property of DSP necessary to
    continue the development, marketing and selling of the compounds
    and products subject to the agreement.

GlobeImmune, Inc.:   In September 2007, we made
    a $3.0 million equity investment in GlobeImmune, Inc., or
    GlobeImmune. In April 2009 and May 2009, we made additional
    $0.1 million and $10.0 million equity investments,
    respectively, in GlobeImmune. In addition, we have a
    collaboration and option agreement with GlobeImmune focused on
    the discovery, development and commercialization of novel
    therapeutics in cancer. As part of this agreement, we made an
    upfront payment in May 2009 of $30.0 million, which was
    recorded as research and development expense, to GlobeImmune in
    return for the option to license compounds and products based on
    the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug
    candidate programs as well as oncology compounds and products
    resulting from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune.
    GlobeImmune will be responsible for all discovery and clinical
    development until we exercise our option with respect to a drug
    candidate program and GlobeImmune will be entitled to receive
    potential milestone payments of approximately
    $230.0 million for the GI-4000 program, $145.0 million
    for each of the GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 programs and
    $161.0 million for each additional future program if
    certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones are
    achieved. GlobeImmune will also receive tiered royalties on
    worldwide net sales.

Our options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and
    GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs will terminate if we
    do not exercise our respective options after delivery of certain
    reports from GlobeImmune on the completed clinical trials with
    respect to each drug candidate program, as set forth in the
    initial development plan specified in the agreement. If we do
    not exercise our options with respect to any drug candidate
    program or future program, our option with respect to the
    oncology products resulting from future programs controlled by
    GlobeImmune will terminate three years after the last of the
    options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and
    GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs terminates. Upon our
    exercise of an option, the agreement will continue until we have
    satisfied all royalty payment obligations to GlobeImmune. Upon
    the expiration of the agreement, on a
     product-by-product, 
     country-by-country 
    basis, GlobeImmune will grant us an exclusive, fully
     paid-up, 
    royalty-free, perpetual license to use certain intellectual
    property of GlobeImmune to market and sell the compounds and
    products developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire
    on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis as we satisfy our royalty payment obligation with respect
    to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

(i) us at our sole discretion, or

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches any of its material obligations
    under the agreement, or

b. files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by us at our sole discretion or
    by GlobeImmune for a material breach by us, then our rights to
    the compounds and products developed under the agreement will
    revert to GlobeImmune. If the agreement is terminated by us for
    a material breach by GlobeImmune, then, among other things, our
    royalty payment obligations under the agreement will be reduced
    by 50%, our development milestone payment obligations under the
    agreement will be reduced by 50% or terminated entirely and our
    sales milestone payment obligations under the agreement will be
    terminated entirely.

Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:   On April 14,
    2010, we entered into a discovery and development collaboration
    and license agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or
    Agios, which focuses on cancer metabolism targets and the
    discovery, development and commercialization of associated
    therapeutics. As part of the agreement, we paid Agios a
    $121.2 million non-refundable, upfront payment, which was
    expensed by us as research and development in the second quarter
    of 2010. We also made an $8.8 million equity investment in
    Agios Series B Convertible Preferred

16

Table of Contents   

Stock, representing approximately a 10.94% ownership interest in
    Agios and is included in other non-current assets in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. We receive an initial period of
    exclusivity during which we have the option to develop any drugs
    resulting from the Agios cancer metabolism research platform and
    may extend this exclusivity period by providing Agios additional
    funding. We have an exclusive option to license any resulting
    clinical candidates developed during this period and will lead
    and fund global development and commercialization of certain
    licensed programs. With respect to each product in a program
    that we choose to license, Agios could receive up to
    $120.0 million upon achievement of certain milestones plus
    royalties on sales, and Agios may also participate in the
    development and commercialization of certain products in the
    United States. Agios may also receive a one-time milestone
    payment of $25.0 million upon dosing of the final human
    subject in a Phase II study, such payment to be made only
    once with respect to only one program.

Unless the agreement is earlier terminated or the option term is
    extended, our option will terminate on April 14, 2013.
    However, if certain development targets are not met, we may
    unilaterally extend the option term: (a) for up to an
    additional one year without payment; (b) subject to certain
    criteria and upon payment of certain predetermined amounts to
    Agios, for up to two additional years thereafter.

Following expiration of the option, the agreement will continue
    in place with respect to programs to which we have exercised our
    option or otherwise are granted rights to develop. The agreement
    may expire on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis as we satisfy our payment obligation with respect to each
    product in each country. Upon the expiration of the agreement
    with respect to a product in a country, all licenses granted by
    one party to the other party for such product in such country
    shall become fully
     paid-up, 
    perpetual, sub licensable, irrevocable and royalty-free.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

(i) us at its sole discretion, or

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such
    breach within the specified period, or

b. files for bankruptcy.

The party terminating under (i) or (ii)(a) above has the
    right to terminate on a
     program-by-program 
    basis leaving the agreement in effect with respect to remaining
    programs. If the agreement or any program is terminated by us
    for convenience or by Agios for a material breach or bankruptcy
    by us, then, among other things, depending on the type of
    program and territorial rights: (a) certain licenses
    granted by us to Agios shall stay in place, subject to
    Agios  payment of certain royalties to us: and (b) we
    will grant Agios a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free
    license to certain technology developed in the conduct of the
    collaboration and used in the program (which license is
    exclusive with respect to certain limited collaboration
    technology). If the agreement or any program is terminated by us
    for a material breach or bankruptcy by Agios, then, among other
    things, all licenses granted by us to Agios will terminate and:
    (i) our license from Agios will continue in perpetuity and
    all payment obligations will be reduced or will terminate;
    (ii) our license for certain programs will become exclusive
    worldwide: and (iii) with regard to any program where we
    have exercised buy-in rights, Agios shall continue to pay
    certain royalties to us.

We have determined that Agios is a variable interest entity;
    however, we are not the primary beneficiary of Agios. Although
    we would have the right to receive the benefits from the
    collaboration and license agreement and it is probable that this
    agreement incorporates the activities that most significantly
    impact the economic performance of Agios for up to six years, we
    do not have the power to direct the activities under the
    collaboration and license agreement as Agios has the
    decision-making authority for the Joint Steering Committee and
    Joint Research Committee until we exercise our option to license
    a product. Our interest in Agios is limited to our 10.94% equity
    ownership and we do not have any obligations or rights to the
    future losses or returns of Agios beyond this ownership. The
    collaboration agreement, including the upfront payment and
    series B convertible preferred stock investment, does not
    entitle us to participate in future returns beyond the 10.94%
    ownership and it does not obligate us to absorb future losses
    beyond the $8.8 million investment in Agios Series B
    Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, there are no other
    agreements other than the collaboration agreement that entitle
    us to receive returns beyond the 10.94% ownership or obligate us
    to absorb additional losses.

    specifications. We also own and operate an FDA approved drug
    product manufacturing facility in Boudry, Switzerland which is
    used for the formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing
    and distribution of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    THALOMID   .

    Our backup FDA approved drug product manufacturing service
    providers include Penn Pharmaceutical Ltd. and Institute of Drug
    Technology Australia Ltd. Our packaging service providers
    include Sharp Corporation for worldwide packaging and Acino
    Holding Ltd. for
     non-U.S. packaging. 

As a result of the acquisition of Abraxis, we obtained
    manufacturing facilities in Melrose Park, Illinois; Phoenix,
    Arizona; Oelwein, Iowa; Elk Grove Village, Illinois and
    Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. A portion of the manufacturing
    facility in Melrose Park has been leased to APP Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc., or APP, and APP has agreed to provide certain contract
    manufacturing services to us in accordance with the terms of the
    manufacturing agreement. In addition, we lease from APP a
    portion of APP s Grand Island, New York manufacturing
    facility to enable us to perform our responsibilities under the
    manufacturing agreement with APP for its term. The initial term
    of the manufacturing agreement will expire on December 31,
    2011, but could be extended for one year if either APP exercises
    its option to extend the lease for our Melrose Park
    manufacturing facility for an additional year or we exercise our
    option to extend the lease for APP s Grand Island
    manufacturing facility for an additional year.
    ABRAXANE   

    is manufactured at both the Melrose Park and Grand Island
    facilities. The Puerto Rico facility is an API manufacturing
    plant which is currently not in use.

Prior to a 2007 separation agreement, Abraxis and APP had been a
    single company named American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. In
    2007, American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. was separated into
    two independent publicly traded companies: Abraxis which was
    focused on oncology and research activities; and APP, which was
    focused on hospital-based activities. After the separation, APP
    was purchased by Fresenius, a publicly traded global health care
    company.

The API for
    VIDAZA   

    is supplied by Ash Stevens, Inc. and Carbogen Amcis. We also
    have contract manufacturing agreements with Baxter GmbH and Ben
    Venue Laboratories, Inc., or Ben Venue, for
    VIDAZA   

    product formulation, filling vials and packaging. Our packaging
    service provider for
     non-U.S. packaging 
    is Catalent Pharma Solutions.

The API for
    ISTODAX   

    is supplied by Sandoz and Ben Venue provides the product
    formulation, filling vials and packaging.

The API for
    FOCALIN   

    and FOCALIN
    XR   

    is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc.
    and Siegfried USA Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer,
    Mikart, Inc., for the tableting and packaging of
    FOCALIN   

    finished product.

CCT currently operates an FDA registered facility in Cedar
    Knolls, New Jersey for the recovery and storage of cord blood
    and placental stem cells for
    LifeBankUSA   .

    In addition, our Warren, New Jersey facility is FDA registered
    for production of PDA-001, a culture-expanded placenta-derived
    stem cell under cGMP to supply clinical studies. This is a
    multi-purpose facility capable of supporting other products.

INTERNATIONAL
    OPERATIONS  

We have significant operations outside the United States
    conducted both through our subsidiaries and through
    distributors. Revenues from operations outside the United States
    were 39.6% of total revenues in 2010, 35.6% of total revenues in
    2009 and 29.8% of total revenues in 2008. The increase in the
    percentage of total revenues from outside of the United States
    is the result of our ongoing efforts to increase the
    availability of our products to patients.

Our international headquarters and a drug product manufacturing
    facility which performs formulation, encapsulation, packaging,
    warehousing and distribution are located in Boudry, Switzerland.
    We continue to expand our international regulatory, clinical and
    commercial infrastructure and currently conduct our
    international

18

Table of Contents   

operations in over 65 countries and regions including Europe,
    Latin America, Middle East, Asia/Pacific and Canada.

Our international operations are subject to risks associated
    with operating on an international basis including currency
    fluctuations, price and exchange controls and other restrictive
    governmental actions. Our international operations are also
    subject to government-imposed constraints including laws on
    pricing, reimbursement and access to our products. Depending on
    the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar,
    foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported
    dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While
    we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign
    exchange rates or the effect they will have, we attempt to
    mitigate their impact through operational means and by using
    foreign currency forward contracts. See the discussions under
     Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk. 

SALES AND
    COMMERCIALIZATION  

We endeavor to promote our brands globally through our highly
    trained commercial organization that has significant experience
    in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the areas of
    oncology and immunology. Our commercial organization supports
    our currently marketed brands and prepares for the launches of
    new products as well as new indications for existing products.
    We have a team of dedicated Market Access professionals to help
    physicians, patients and payers understand the value our
    products deliver. Given our goal to ensure that patients who
    might benefit from our therapies have the opportunity to do so
    and given the complex reimbursement environment in the United
    States, we offer the services of Celgene Patient
    Support   .

    Celgene Patient
    Support   

    provides a dedicated, central point of contact for patients and
    healthcare professionals who use Celgene products. Celgene
    Patient
    Support   

    is a free service that helps patients and healthcare
    professionals navigate the challenges of reimbursement,
    providing information about co-pay assistance, and answering
    questions about obtaining Celgene products.

In most countries, we sell our products through our own sales
    organizations. In some countries, particularly in Latin America,
    we partner with other third-party distributors. (See Section
     COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS  above.) Generally, we
    distribute our products through the commonly used channels in
    local markets. However,
    REVLIMID   

    and
    THALOMID   

    (inclusive of Thalidomide
    Celgene   

    and Thalidomide
    Pharmion   )

    are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution
    programs tailored to meet local competent authorities 
    specifications to help ensure their safe and appropriate
    distribution and use.

EMPLOYEES  

As of December 31, 2010, we had 4,182 full-time
    company-wide employees, 526 of which were engaged primarily in
    manufacturing, 1,983 engaged primarily in research and
    development activities, 1,013 engaged primarily in sales and
    commercialization activities and the remainder engaged primarily
    in executive and general and administrative activities. The
    number of full-time employees in our international operations
    has grown from 1,051 at the end of 2009 to 1,273 at the end of
    2010. We also employ a number of part-time employees and
    maintain consulting arrangements with a number of researchers at
    various universities and other research institutions around the
    world.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS  

Certain statements contained or incorporated by reference in
    this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K 
    are forward-looking statements concerning our business, results
    of operations, economic performance and financial condition
    based on our current expectations. Forward-looking statements
    within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended and within the meaning of Section 21E of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
    Act, are included, for example, in the discussions about:

strategy;

new product discovery and development;

current or pending clinical trials;

19

Table of Contents   

our products  ability to demonstrate efficacy or an
    acceptable safety profile;

actions by the FDA;

product manufacturing, including our arrangements with
    third-party suppliers;

product introduction and sales;

royalties and contract revenues;

expenses and net income;

credit and foreign exchange risk management;

liquidity;

asset and liability risk management; and

operational and legal risks.

From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in
    other materials we release to the public, as well as oral
    forward-looking statements. All our forward-looking statements
    give our then current expectations or forecasts of future
    events. None of our forward-looking statements are guarantees of
    future performance, although we believe we have been prudent in
    our plans and assumptions. Each forward-looking statement
    involves risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate
    assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those implied by our forward-looking statement. Should
    known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
    underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could
    differ materially from past results and those anticipated,
    estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you
    consider our forward-looking statements. Given these risks,
    uncertainties and assumptions, you are cautioned not to place
    undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

We have tried, wherever possible, to identify these
    forward-looking statements by using words such as
     forecast,   project, 
     anticipate,   plan,   strategy, 
     intend,   potential,   outlook, 
     target,   seek,   continue, 
     believe,   could,   estimate, 
     expect,   may,   probable, 
     should,   will  or other words of similar
    meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of
    our future operations, business plans and prospects, prospective
    products or product approvals, our strategies for growth,
    product development and regulatory approval, our expenses, the
    impact of foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies,
    such as legal proceedings, and our financial performance and
    results generally. You also can identify our forward-looking
    statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
    historical or current facts.

We provide in this report a cautionary discussion of risks and
    uncertainties relevant to our business under the headings
     Item 1A. Risk Factors  and  Item 7.
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations.  We note these factors as
    permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate,
    we think could cause our actual results to differ materially
    from expected and historical results. You should understand,
    however, that it is not possible to predict or identify all such
    factors. Consequently, you should not consider the factors that
    are noted to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or
    uncertainties.

Except as required under the federal securities laws and the
    rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    or SEC, we disclaim and do not undertake any obligations to
    update or revise publicly any of our forward-looking statements,
    including forward-looking statements in this report, whether as
    a result of new information, future events, changes in
    assumptions, or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult
    any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our
    Quarterly Reports on
     Form 10-Q 
    and Current Reports on
     Form 8-K 
    filed with or furnished to the SEC.

ITEM 1A.      

RISK
    FACTORS   

The following statements describe the major risks to our
    business and should be considered carefully. Any of these
    factors could significantly and negatively affect our business,
    prospects, financial condition, operating results or credit
    ratings, which could cause the trading price of our common stock
    to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we
    may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
    to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could
    also negatively affect our business, our results and operations.

We may
    experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating
    results which could cause our financial results to be below
    expectations and cause our stock price to be
    volatile.   

We have historically experienced, and may continue to
    experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating
    results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many
    of which are outside our control, and may result in volatility
    of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many
    factors, including:

demand or lack of demand for our products, including demand that
    adversely affects our ability to optimize the use of our
    manufacturing facilities;

the introduction and pricing of products competitive with ours,
    including generic competition;

developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products;

regulatory approvals for our products and pricing determinations
    with respect to our products;

regulatory approvals for our and our competitor s
    manufacturing facilities;

timing and levels of spending for research and development,
    sales and marketing;

timing and levels of reimbursement from third-party payers for
    our products;

development or expansion of business infrastructure in new
    clinical and geographic markets;

the acquisition of new products and companies;

tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;

timing and recognition of certain research and development
    milestones and license fees;

ability to control our costs;

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and

economic and market instability.

We are
    dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary
    products
    REVLIMID       ,

      VIDAZA   ,

    THALOMID     

      and
    ABRAXANE     

      and a significant decline in demand for or use of these
    products or our other commercially available products could
    materially and adversely affect our operating results.  

During the next several years, the growth of our business will
    be largely dependent on the commercial success of
    REVLIMID   ,

    VIDAZA   ,

    THALOMID   ,

    and
    ABRAXANE   .

    We cannot predict whether these or our other existing or new
    products will be accepted by regulators, physicians, patients
    and other key opinion leaders as effective drugs with certain
    advantages over existing or future therapies. We are continuing
    to introduce our products in additional international markets
    and to obtain approvals for additional indications both in the
    United States and internationally. A delay in gaining the
    requisite regulatory approvals for these markets or indications
    could negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our
    stock.

Further, if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in
    connection with the use of our products, physician and patient
    comfort with the product could be undermined, the commercial
    success of such products could be adversely affected and the
    acceptance of our other products could be negatively impacted.
    We are subject to adverse event reporting regulations that
    require us to report to the FDA or similar bodies in other
    countries if our products are associated with a death or serious
    injury. These adverse events, among others, could result in
    additional regulatory controls, such as the performance of
    costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our
    approved

21

Table of Contents   

labeling, which could limit the indications or patient
    population for our products or could even lead to the withdrawal
    of a product from the market. Similarly, the occurrence of
    serious adverse events known or suspected to be related to the
    products could negatively impact product sales. For example,
    THALOMID   

    is known to be toxic to the human fetus and exposure to the drug
    during pregnancy could result in significant deformities in the
    baby.
    REVLIMID   

    is also considered fetal toxic and there are warnings against
    use of
    VIDAZA   

    in pregnant women as well. While we have restricted distribution
    systems for both
    THALOMID   

    and
    REVLIMID   

    and we endeavor to educate patients regarding the potential
    known adverse events including pregnancy risks, we cannot ensure
    that all such warnings and recommendations will be complied with
    or that adverse events resulting from non-compliance will not
    have a material adverse effect on our business.

It is necessary that our primary products achieve and maintain
    market acceptance as well as our other products including
    ISTODAX   ,

    FOCALIN
    XR   

    and the
    RITALIN   

    family of drugs. A number of factors may adversely impact the
    degree of market acceptance of our products, including the
    products  efficacy, safety and advantages, if any, over
    competing products, as well as the reimbursement policies of
    third-party payers, such as government and private insurance
    plans, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects.

If we
    do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products we
    will be unable to sell our current products and products in
    development.   

Changes in law, government regulations or policies can have a
    significant impact on our results of operations. The discovery,
    preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, risk
    evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our
    S.T.E.P.S.   

    and
    RevAssist   

    programs), marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and
    biologics are all subject to extensive laws and regulations,
    including, without limitation, the U.S. Federal Food, Drug,
    and Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Public Health Service Act,
    Medicare Modernization Act, Food and Drug Administration
    Amendments Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the
    Sherman Antitrust Act, patent laws, environmental laws, privacy
    laws and other federal and state statutes, including
    anti-kickback, antitrust and false claims laws, as well as
    similar laws in foreign jurisdictions. Enforcement of and
    changes in laws, government regulations or policies can have a
    significant adverse impact on our ability to continue to
    commercialize our products or introduce new products to the
    market, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

If we or our agents, contractors or collaborators are delayed in
    receiving, or are unable to obtain all, necessary governmental
    approvals, we will be unable to effectively market our products.

The testing, marketing and manufacturing of our products
    requires regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA
    and, in some cases, from the Environmental Protection Agency, or
    EPA, or governmental authorities outside of the United States
    that perform roles similar to those of the FDA and EPA,
    including the EMA, EC, the Swissmedic, the Australian
    Therapeutic Goods Administration and Health Canada. Certain of
    our pharmaceutical products, such as
    FOCALIN   ,

    fall under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 that requires
    authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA,
    of the U.S. Department of Justice in order to handle and
    distribute these products.

The regulatory approval process presents a number of risks to
    us, principally:

In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many
    years, and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and
    the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible
    to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent
    regulatory approval;

Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the
    regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or
    other data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure
    of the product to meet, a regulatory agency s requirements
    for safety, efficacy and quality or, in the case of a product
    seeking an orphan drug indication, because another designee
    received approval first or receives approval of other labeled
    indications;

Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to
    changes in regulatory agency policy, or the adoption of new
    regulations or legislation;

22

Table of Contents   

The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may
    significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may
    be marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant
    limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and
    contra-indications that could materially affect the sales and
    profitability of the drug;

Approved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject
    to continuing and ongoing review, and discovery of previously
    unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to
    manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in
    restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their
    withdrawal from the market;

Regulatory authorities and agencies of the United States or
    foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations
    restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products,
    including specifically tailored risk evaluation and mitigation
    strategies;

Guidelines and recommendations published by various governmental
    and non-governmental organizations can reduce the use of our
    products;

Once a product receives marketing approval, we may not market
    that product for broader or different applications, and the FDA
    may not grant us approval with respect to separate product
    applications that represent extensions of our basic technology.
    In addition, the FDA may withdraw or modify existing approvals
    in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations
    restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. The
    FDA may also request that we perform additional clinical trials
    or change the labeling of our existing or proposed products if
    we or others identify side effects after our products are on the
    market;

Products, such as
    REVLIMID   ,

    that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an
    expedited withdrawal if the post-marketing study commitments are
    not completed with due diligence, the post-marketing
    restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to
    assure the safe use of the drug, or evidence demonstrates that
    the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under its
    conditions of use. Additionally, promotional materials for such
    products are subject to enhanced surveillance, including
    pre-approval review of all promotional materials used within
    120 days following marketing approval and a requirement for
    the submissions 30 days prior to initial dissemination of
    all promotional materials disseminated after 120 days
    following marketing approval; and

Our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, labeling and
    promotional activities relating to our products as well as our
    post-marketing activities are regulated by the FDA, the Federal
    Trade Commission, The United States Department of Justice, the
    DEA, state regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory agencies
    and are subject to associated risks. In addition, individual
    states, acting through their attorneys general, have become
    active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of
    prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false
    advertising laws. If we fail to comply with regulations
    regarding the promotion and sale of our products, appropriate
    distribution of our products under our restricted distribution
    systems, prohibition on off-label promotion and the promotion of
    unapproved products, such agencies may bring enforcement actions
    against us that could inhibit our commercial capabilities as
    well as result in significant penalties.

Other matters that may be the subject of governmental or
    regulatory action which could adversely affect our business
    include:

changes in laws and regulations, including without limitation,
    patent, environmental, privacy, health care and competition laws;

importation of prescription drugs from outside the U.S. at
    prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign
    countries;

additional restrictions on interactions with healthcare
    professionals; and

privacy restrictions that may limit our ability to share data
    from foreign jurisdictions.

We collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our unrelated
    allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses. The
    FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
    currently regulates human tissue or cells intended for
    transplantation, implantation, infusion or transfer to a human
    recipient under 21 CFR Parts 1270 and

23

Table of Contents   

1271. Part 1271 requires cell and tissue establishments to
    screen and test donors, to prepare and follow written procedures
    for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to
    register the establishment with FDA. This part also provides for
    inspection by the FDA of cell and tissue establishments. The FDA
    recently announced that as of October 21, 2011, a BLA will
    be required to distribute cord blood for unrelated allogeneic
    use. Currently, we are required to be, and are, licensed to
    operate in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California. If
    other states adopt similar licensing requirements, we would need
    to obtain such licenses to continue operating our stem cell
    banking businesses. If we are delayed in receiving, or are
    unable to obtain at all, necessary licenses, we will be unable
    to provide services in those states and this could impact
    negatively on our revenues.

Sales
    of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and
    reimbursement for our products by governmental and other
    third-party payers is reduced or terminated.   

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to
    which the costs of our products will be paid by health
    maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health
    care management organizations, or reimbursed by government
    health administration authorities, private health coverage
    insurers and other third-party payers. Generally, in Europe and
    other countries outside the United States, the
    government-sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of
    healthcare costs of patients. These health care management
    organizations and third-party payers are increasingly
    challenging the prices charged for medical products and
    services. Additionally, the newly enacted Health Care Reform Act
    has provided sweeping health care reform, which may impact the
    prices of drugs. In addition to the newly enacted federal
    legislation, state legislatures and foreign governments have
    also shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment
    programs, including price controls, restrictions on
    reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic
    products. The establishment of limitations on patient access to
    our drugs, adoption of price controls and cost-containment
    measures in new jurisdictions or programs, and adoption of more
    restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and
    measures, including the impact of the Health Care Reform Act,
    could adversely impact our business and future results. If these
    organizations and third-party payers do not consider our
    products to be cost-effective compared to other available
    therapies, they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our
    products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be
    sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable
    basis.

Our ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United
    States depends in part on our relationships with group
    purchasing organizations, or GPOs. Many existing and potential
    customers for our products become members of GPOs. GPOs
    negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes on an
    exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and
    distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to
    a GPO s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are
    not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals
    and other members may be less likely to purchase our products,
    and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share
    compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer s
    products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of
    the GPO for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our
    failure to renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market
    share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales,
    financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure
    you that we will be able to renew these contracts at the current
    or substantially similar terms. If we are unable to keep our
    relationships and develop new relationships with GPOs, our
    competitive position may suffer.

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most
    countries outside the United States. International operations
    are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls
    and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing
    emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other
    countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and
    usage of our products. Although we cannot predict the extent to
    which our business may be affected by future cost-containment
    measures or other potential legislative or regulatory
    developments, additional foreign price controls or other changes
    in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able
    to charge for our current and future products, which could
    adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.

Our
    long-term success depends, in part, on intellectual property
    protection.   

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and
    enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to
    technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business
    without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The
    patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical
    companies, including ours, can be uncertain

24

Table of Contents   

and involve complex legal and factual questions including those
    related to our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (such
    as our
    S.T.E.P.S.   

    and
    RevAssist   

    programs). In addition, the coverage sought in a patent
    application can be significantly reduced before the patent is
    issued.

Consequently, we do not know whether any of our owned or
    licensed pending patent applications, which have not already
    been allowed, will result in the issuance of patents or, if any
    patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by
    third-party patent rights, whether they will provide significant
    proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they
    will be circumvented, opposed, invalidated, rendered
    unenforceable or infringed by others. Further, we are aware of
    third-party U.S. patents that relate to, for example, the
    use of certain stem cell technologies and cannot be assured as
    to any impact to our potential products, or guarantee that our
    patents or pending applications will not be involved in, or be
    defeated as a result of, opposition proceedings before a foreign
    patent office or any interference proceedings before the United
    States Patent   Trademark Office, or PTO.

With respect to patents and patent applications we have
    licensed-in, there can be no assurance that additional patents
    will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have
    licensed patent rights, or that, if any new patents are issued,
    such patents will not be opposed, challenged, invalidated,
    infringed or dominated or provide us with significant
    proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Moreover, there
    can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed patents
    will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial
    advantage. Nor can we guarantee that these licensed patents will
    not be either infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others,
    or that the relevant agreements will not be terminated. Any
    termination of the licenses granted to us by CMCC could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Because 1) patent applications filed in the United States
    on or before November 28, 2000 are maintained in secrecy
    until patents issue, 2) patent applications filed in the
    United States on or after November 29, 2000 are not
    published until approximately 18 months after their
    earliest claimed priority date, 3) United States patent
    applications that are not filed outside the United States may
    not publish at all until issued, and 4) publication of
    discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag
    behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, or our
    licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each
    of the issued patents or pending patent applications or that we,
    or our licensors, were the first to file patent applications for
    such inventions. In the event a third party has also filed a
    patent for any of our inventions, we, or our licensors, may have
    to participate in interference proceedings before the PTO to
    determine priority of invention, which could result in the loss
    of a U.S. patent or loss of any opportunity to secure
    U.S. patent protection for the invention. Even if the
    eventual outcome is favorable to us, such interference
    proceedings could result in substantial cost to us.

We may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing
    patents or we may be required to obtain licenses to such
    patents. However, we do not know whether such licenses will be
    available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
    Prosecution of patent applications and litigation to establish
    the validity and scope of patents, to assert patent infringement
    claims against others and to defend against patent infringement
    claims by others can be expensive and time-consuming. There can
    be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our
    owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third
    parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge
    will determine that such patent claims are valid and
    enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation could cause
    us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated
    by such patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on
    our business. If a third party is found to have rights covering
    products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease
    using the products or processes covered by the disputed rights,
    be subject to significant liabilities to such third party
     and/or  be
    required to license technologies from such third party. Also,
    different countries have different procedures for obtaining
    patents, and patents issued by different countries provide
    different degrees of protection against the use of a patented
    invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that
    the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an
    invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of
    patents covering the same invention or that any judicial
    interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the
    claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the
    judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued
    in another country. Competitors have chosen and in the future
    may choose to file oppositions to patent applications, which
    have been deemed allowable by foreign patent examiners.
    Furthermore, even if our owned or licensed patents are
    determined to be valid and enforceable, there can be no
    assurance that competitors will not be able to design around
    such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative
    technology. Additionally, for these same reasons, we cannot be
    sure that patents of a broader scope than ours may be issued and
    thereby create freedom to

25

Table of Contents   

operate issues. If this occurs we may need to reevaluate
    pursuing such technology, which is dominated by others 
    patent rights, or alternatively, seek a license to practice our
    own invention, whether or not patented.

We also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret
    technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality
    agreements with our collaborative partners, employees,
    consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored
    researchers and other advisors. There can be no assurance that
    these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will
    not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any
    such breach or that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and
    technological advances will not otherwise become known to
    others. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite
    precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain
    access to our proprietary technology or that such technology
    will not be found to be non-proprietary or not a trade secret.

Our
    products may face competition from lower cost generic or
    follow-on products and providers of these products may be able
    to sell them at a substantially lower cost than
    us.   

Generic drug manufacturers are seeking to compete with our
    drugs, and present an important challenge to us. Even if our
    patent applications, or those we have licensed-in, are issued,
    innovative and generic drug manufacturers and other competitors
    may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of such
    patents in court, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and
    costly litigation. Alternatively, innovative and generic drug
    manufacturers and other competitors may be able to design around
    our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the
    resulting alternative technology. If any of our issued or
    licensed patents are infringed or challenged, we may not be
    successful in enforcing or defending our or our licensor s
    intellectual property rights and subsequently may not be able to
    develop or market the applicable product exclusively.

Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our
    products, or upon the  at-risk  launch (despite
    pending patent infringement litigation against the generic
    product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one
    of our products, we can quickly lose a significant portion of
    our sales of that product, which can adversely affect our
    business. In addition, if generic versions of our
    competitors  branded products lose their market
    exclusivity, our patented products may face increased
    competition which can adversely affect our business.

The FDA approval process allows for the approval of an ANDA or
    505(b)(2) application for a generic version of our approved
    products upon the expiration, through passage of time or
    successful legal challenge, of relevant patent or non-patent
    exclusivity protection. Generic manufacturers pursuing ANDA
    approvals are not required to conduct costly and time-consuming
    clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of their
    products; rather, they are permitted to rely on the
    innovator s data regarding safety and efficacy. Thus,
    generic manufacturers can sell their products at prices much
    lower than those charged by the innovative pharmaceutical or
    biotechnology companies who have incurred substantial expenses
    associated with the research and development of the drug
    product. Accordingly, while our products currently may retain
    certain regulatory and or patent exclusivity, our products are
    or will be subject to ANDA applications to the FDA in light of
    the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act. The ANDA procedure includes provisions allowing
    generic manufacturers to challenge the effectiveness of the
    innovator s patent protection prior to the generic
    manufacturer actually commercializing their products  
    the so-called  Paragraph IV  certification
    procedure. In recent years, generic manufacturers have used
    Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge the
    applicability of Orange Book-listed patents on a wide array of
    innovative pharmaceuticals, and we expect this trend to continue
    and to implicate drug products with even relatively modest
    revenues. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA is generally
    prevented from granting effective approval of an ANDA. Upon the
    expiration of the applicable exclusivities, through passage of
    time or successful legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective
    approval of an ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference
    to a previously protected NDA in a 505(b)(2) application.
    Further, upon such expiration event, the FDA may require a
    generic competitor to participate in some form of risk
    management system which could include our participation as well.
    Depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities, any
    such approval could be limited to certain formulations
     and/or 
    indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding
    exclusivities.

If an ANDA filer or a generic manufacturer were to receive
    approval to sell a generic or follow-on version of one of our
    products, that product would become subject to increased
    competition and our revenues for that product would be adversely
    affected.

26

Table of Contents   

We have received a Paragraph IV Certification Letter dated
    August 30, 2010, advising us that Natco Pharma Limited of
    Hyderabad, India, or Natco, submitted an ANDA to the FDA. See
    Part 1, Item 3,  Legal Proceedings  
    Revlimid    

    of this report for further discussion.

If we
    are not able to effectively compete our business will be
    adversely affected.   

The pharmaceutical and biotech industry in which we operate is
    highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant
    technological change. Our present and potential competitors
    include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as
    well as specialty pharmaceutical firms, including, but not
    limited to:

Takeda and Johnson   Johnson, which compete with
    REVLIMID   

    and
    THALOMID   

    in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with
    our compounds;

Eisai Co., Ltd., SuperGen, Inc. and Johnson   Johnson,
    which compete or may potentially compete with
    VIDAZA   ,

    in addition Eisai Co., Ltd. potentially competes with
    ABRAXANE   ,

    and in other oncology products in general;

Amgen, which potentially competes with our TNF-  and kinase
    inhibitors;

AstraZeneca plc, which potentially competes in clinical trials
    with our compounds and TNF-  inhibitors;

Biogen Idec Inc. and Genzyme Corporation, both of which are
    generally developing drugs that address the oncology and
    immunology markets;

Bristol Myers Squibb Co., which potentially competes with
    ABRAXANE   ,

    and in clinical trials with our compounds and TNF- 
    inhibitors, in addition to other oncology products in general;

F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., which potentially competes
    in clinical trials with our
    IMiDs   

    compounds and TNF-  inhibitors, in addition to other
    oncology products in general;

Johnson   Johnson, which potentially competes with
    certain of our proprietary programs, including our oral
    anti-inflammatory programs;

Abbott Laboratories, which potentially competes with our oral
    anti-inflammatory programs;

Novartis, which potentially competes with our compounds and
    kinase programs;

Pfizer, which potentially competes in clinical trials with our
    kinase inhibitors; and

Sanofi-Aventis, which competes with
    ABRAXANE   ,

    in addition to other oncology products in general.

Many of these companies have considerably greater financial,
    technical and marketing resources than we do. This enables them,
    among other things, to make greater research and development
    investments and spread their research and development costs, as
    well as their marketing and promotion costs, over a broader
    revenue base. Our competitors may also have more experience and
    expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA, and
    other regulatory authorities. We also experience competition
    from universities and other research institutions, and in some
    instances, we compete with others in acquiring technology from
    these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is
    expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant
    technological change, and we expect competition to intensify as
    technical advances in the field are made and become more widely
    known. The development of products, including generics, or
    processes by our competitors with significant advantages over
    those that we are seeking to develop could cause the
    marketability of our products to stagnate or decline.

We may
    be required to modify our business practices, pay fines and
    significant expenses or experience losses due to litigation or
    governmental investigations.   

From time to time, we may be subject to litigation or
    governmental investigation on a variety of matters, including,
    without limitation, regulatory, intellectual property, product
    liability, antitrust, consumer, whistleblower, commercial,
    securities and employment litigation and claims and other legal
    proceedings that may arise from the conduct of our business as
    currently conducted or as conducted in the future.

27

In particular, we are subject to significant product liability
    risks as a result of the testing of our products in human
    clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory
    approval.

Pharmaceutical companies involved in Hatch-Waxman litigation are
    often subject to follow-on lawsuits and governmental
    investigations, which may be costly and could result in
    lower-priced generic products that are competitive with our
    products being introduced to the market.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we received a Civil Investigative
    Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,
    or the FTC. The FTC requested documents and other information
    relating to requests by generic companies to purchase our
    patented
    REVLIMID   

    and
    THALOMID   

    brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to
    believe that we have engaged in unfair methods of competition.
    In the first quarter of 2010, the State of Connecticut
    referenced the same issues as those referenced in the 2009 CID
    and issued a subpoena. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we
    received a second CID from the FTC relating to this matter. We
    continue to respond to requests for information.

In the first quarter of 2011, we received a letter from the
    United States Attorney for the Central District of California
    informing us that we were under investigation relating to our
    promotion of the drugs
    THALOMID   

    and
    REVLIMID   

    regarding off-label marketing and improper payments to
    physicians. We are cooperating with the Unites States Attorney
    in connection with this investigation.

On January 20, 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that
    the jurisdiction of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board,
    or the PMPRB, extends to sales of drugs to Canadian patients
    even if the locus of sale is within the United States. This
    means that our U.S. sales of
    THALOMID   

    brand drug to Canadian patients under the special access program
    are subject to PMPRB jurisdiction from and after
    January 12, 1995. In accordance with the ruling of the
    Supreme Court of Canada, we have provided to-date data regarding
    these special access program sales to the PMPRB. In light of the
    approval of
    THALOMID   

    brand drug for multiple myeloma by Health Canada on
    August 4, 2010, this drug is now sold through our Canadian
    entity and is no longer sold to Canadian patients in the United
    States. The PMPRB s proposed pricing arrangement has not
    been determined. Depending on the calculation, we may be
    requested to return certain revenues associated with these sales
    and to pay fines. Should this occur, we would have to consider
    various legal options to address whether the pricing
    determination was reasonable.

Litigation and governmental investigations are inherently
    unpredictable and may:

result in rulings that are materially unfavorable to us,
    including claims for significant damages, fines or penalties,
    and administrative remedies, such as exclusion
     and/or 
    debarment from government programs, or other rulings that
    prevent us from operating our business in a certain manner;

cause us to change our business operations to avoid perceived
    risks associated with such litigation or investigations;

have an adverse affect on our reputation and the demand for our
    products; and

require the expenditure of significant time and resources, which
    may divert the attention of our management and interfere with
    the pursuit of our strategic objectives.

While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our
    insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount
    of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible
    to obtain insurance to protect against all potential risks and
    liabilities. If any litigation or governmental investigation
    were to have a material adverse result, there could be a
    material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or
    financial position. See also Legal Proceedings contained in
    Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K. 

The
    development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy
    and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize any
    of the products we are currently developing.   

Many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of
    research and development and will require the commitment of
    substantial financial resources, extensive research,
    development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing
     scale-up  and
    regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. This process
    involves a high degree of risk and takes many years. Our product
    development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail
    for many

28

Table of Contents   

reasons, including the failure of the product candidate in
    preclinical studies; adverse patient reactions to the product
    candidate or indications or other safety concerns; insufficient
    clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority
    of the product candidate; our inability to manufacture
    sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development
    or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient
    manner; our failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the
    required regulatory approvals for the product candidate, the
    facilities or the process used to manufacture the product
    candidate; or changes in the regulatory environment, including
    pricing and reimbursement, that make development of a new
    product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer
    desirable. Moreover, our commercially available products may
    require additional studies with respect to approved indications
    as well as new indications pending approval.

The stem cell products that we are developing through our CCT
    subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established
    treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional
    products and therapies which are now, or may be in the future,
    manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and
    biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public attitudes may
    be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe, and
    stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or
    the medical community.

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in conducting clinical
    studies, we can give no assurances that our studies will have a
    positive result or that we will receive regulatory approvals for
    our new products or new indications.

Manufacturing
    and distribution risks including a disruption at certain of our
    manufacturing sites would significantly interrupt our production
    capabilities, which could result in significant product delays
    and adversely affect our results.   

We have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our
    products and we have contracted with third-party manufacturers
    and distributors to provide API, encapsulation, finishing
    services packaging and distribution services to meet our needs.
    These risks include the possibility that our or our
    suppliers  manufacturing processes could be partially or
    completely disrupted by a fire, natural disaster, terrorist
    attack, governmental action or military action. In the case of a
    disruption, we may need to establish alternative manufacturing
    sources for these products. This would likely lead to
    substantial production delays as we build or locate replacement
    facilities and seek and obtain the necessary regulatory
    approvals. If this occurs, and our finished goods inventories
    are insufficient to meet demand, we may be unable to satisfy
    customer orders on a timely basis, if at all. Further, our
    business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us
    for any losses that may occur and we would have to bear the
    additional cost of any disruption. For these reasons, a
    significant disruptive event at certain of our manufacturing
    facilities or sites could materially and adversely affect our
    business and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to
    predict market demand for our products, we may be unable to
    sufficiently increase production capacity to satisfy demand or
    may incur costs associated with excess inventory that we
    manufacture.

In all the countries where we sell our products, governmental
    regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing,
    packaging, labeling, distribution and storing. All of our
    suppliers of raw materials, contract manufacturers and
    distributors must comply with these regulations as applicable.
    In the United States, the FDA requires that all suppliers of
    pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers of
    pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve
    and maintain compliance with the FDA s current Good
    Manufacturing Practice regulations and guidelines. Our failure
    to comply, or failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply
    with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being
    imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil
    penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals,
    license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating
    restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could
    significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In
    addition, before any product batch produced by our manufacturers
    can be shipped, it must conform to release specifications
    pre-approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical
    product. If the operations of one or more of our manufacturers
    were to become unavailable for any reason, any required FDA
    review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier
    could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products.

If our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for
    quality, quantity or timeliness, or do not achieve and maintain
    compliance with all applicable regulations, our ability to
    continue supplying such products at a level that meets demand
    could be adversely affected.

29

Table of Contents   

We have contracted with specialty distributors, to distribute
    REVLIMID   ,

    THALOMID   ,

    VIDAZA   ,

    ABRAXANE   

    and
    ISTODAX   

    in the United States. If our distributors fail to perform and we
    cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable
    period of time, we may experience adverse effects to our
    business and results of operations.

We are continuing to establish marketing and distribution
    capabilities in international markets with respect to our
    products. At the same time, we are in the process of obtaining
    necessary governmental and regulatory approvals to sell our
    products in certain countries. If we have not successfully
    completed and implemented adequate marketing and distribution
    support services upon our receipt of such approvals, our ability
    to effectively launch our products in these countries would be
    severely restricted.

The
    consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions
    could increase competitive and pricing pressures on
    pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.   

We sell our pharmaceutical products in the United States
    primarily through wholesale distributors and contracted
    pharmacies. These wholesale customers comprise a significant
    part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in
    the United States. This distribution network is continuing to
    undergo significant consolidation. As a result, a smaller number
    of large wholesale distributors and pharmacy chains control a
    significant share of the market. We expect that consolidation of
    drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains will increase competitive
    and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including
    us. In addition, wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through
     fee-for-service 
    arrangements, and their purchases may exceed customer demand,
    resulting in reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters. We
    cannot assure you that we can manage these pressures or that
    wholesaler purchases will not decrease as a result of this
    potential excess buying.

Risks
    from the improper conduct of employees, agents or contractors or
    collaborators could adversely affect our business or
    reputation.   

We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and
    procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed
    by our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators that
    would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in
    which we operate, including without limitation, employment,
    foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition and
    privacy laws. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or
    criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties and
    could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results
    of operations and reputation.

The
    integration of Abraxis and other acquired businesses may present
    significant challenges to us.   

We may face significant challenges in effectively integrating
    entities and businesses that we acquire, such as Abraxis, and we
    may not realize the benefits anticipated from such acquisitions.
    Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Abraxis
    will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses
    in an efficient and effective manner. Our integration of Abraxis
    involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:

demands on management related to the increase in our size after
    the acquisition;

the diversion of management s attention from the management
    of daily operations to the integration of operations;

higher integration costs than anticipated;

failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;

difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;

difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and
    practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and
    geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and

difficulties in the integration of departments, systems,
    including accounting systems, technologies, books and records,
    and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards,
    controls, including internal control over financial reporting
    required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related
    procedures and policies.

Table of Contents   

If we cannot successfully integrate Abraxis we may experience
    material negative consequences to our business, financial
    condition or results of operations. Successful integration of
    Abraxis will depend on our ability to manage these operations,
    to realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by
    offerings and expanded geographic market coverage and, to some
    degree, to eliminate redundant and excess costs. Because of
    difficulties in combining geographically distant operations, we
    may not be able to achieve the benefits that we hope to achieve
    as a result of the acquisition with Abraxis.

Our
    inability to continue to attract and retain key leadership,
    managerial, commercial and scientific talent could adversely
    affect our business.   

The success of our business depends, in large part, on our
    continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly
    qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and commercial
    personnel, (ii) successfully integrate large numbers of new
    employees into our corporate culture and (iii) develop and
    maintain important relationships with leading research and
    medical institutions and key distributors. Competition for these
    types of personnel and relationships is intense.

Among other benefits, we use share-based compensation to attract
    and retain personnel. Share-based compensation accounting rules
    require us to recognize all share-based compensation costs as
    expenses. These or other factors could reduce the number of
    shares and options management and our board of directors grants
    under our incentive plan. We cannot be sure that we will be able
    to attract or retain skilled personnel or maintain key
    relationships, or that the costs of retaining such personnel or
    maintaining such relationships will not materially increase.

We
    could be subject to significant liability as a result of risks
    associated with using hazardous materials in our
    business.   

We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development,
    manufacturing and general business activities. While we believe
    we are currently in substantial compliance with the federal,
    state and local laws and regulations governing the use of these
    materials, we cannot be certain that accidental injury or
    contamination will not occur. If an accident or environmental
    discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by
    prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of
    properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup
    obligations, damages and fines. This could result in substantial
    liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and
    financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with
    environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in
    the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources
    either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance
    coverage.

Changes
    in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our
    results of operations.   

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and
    international tax liabilities are dependent upon the
    distribution of income among these different jurisdictions.
    Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our
    effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not
    limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, the accounting
    for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in
    tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development
    spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of
    earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate,
    the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue
    Service and other jurisdictions, the accuracy of our estimates
    for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax
    assets, and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The
    impact on our income tax provision resulting from the
    above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have an
    impact on our results of operations.

Currency
    fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could increase our
    costs and may cause our profitability to decline.   

We collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and
    expenditures in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
    Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
    affect our operating results.

31

Table of Contents   

We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign
    currency risk, but not to engage in currency speculation. We use
    these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions
    and balance sheet exposures denominated in foreign currencies.
    We use derivative instruments, including those not designated as
    part of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to
    movements in foreign exchange rates. The use of these derivative
    instruments mitigates the exposure of these risks with the
    intent to reduce our risk or cost but may not fully offset any
    change in operating results that result from fluctuations in
    foreign currencies. Any significant foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and
    results of operations.

We may
    experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet
    our financial reporting obligations.   

As we continue to expand at a rapid pace, the development of new
     and/or 
    improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority.
    During this expansion period, our internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in
    our financial reporting. Such misstatements may result in
    litigation
     and/or 
    negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction
    that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our
    common stock.

The
    decline of global economic conditions could adversely affect our
    results of operations.   

Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on
    reimbursement from government health administration authorities,
    private health insurers, distribution partners and other
    organizations. As a result of the current global credit and
    financial market conditions, these organizations may be unable
    to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment.
    In addition, U.S. federal and state health authorities may
    reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and private
    insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. A reduction in
    the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively
    affect our product sales, revenue and cash flows.

Due to tightened global credit, there may be a disruption or
    delay in the performance of our third-party contractors,
    suppliers or collaborators. We rely on third parties for several
    important aspects of our business, including portions of our
    product manufacturing, royalty revenue, clinical development of
    future collaboration products, conduct of clinical trials and
    raw materials. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their
    commitments to us, our business could be adversely affected.

The
    price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you
    may lose some or all of your investment in us.   

The market for our shares of common stock may be subject to
    disruptions that could cause volatility in its price. In
    general, current global economic conditions have caused
    substantial market volatility and instability. Any such
    disruptions or continuing volatility may adversely affect the
    value of our common stock. In addition to current global
    economic instability in general, the following key factors may
    have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock:

results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with
    our marketed products;

fluctuations in our commercial and operating results;

announcements of technical or product developments by us or our
    competitors;

market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in
    particular;

stock market conditions generally;

changes in governmental regulations and laws, including, without
    limitation, changes in tax laws, health care legislation,
    environmental laws, competition laws, and patent laws;

new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;

public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment
    of the disease states that we are targeting;

32

Table of Contents   

patent or proprietary rights developments;

changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for
    our products;

the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes
    related to production and formulation of those products or uses
    of those products;

other litigation or governmental investigations;

competition; and

investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product
    acquisitions.

In addition, our operations may be materially affected by
    conditions in the global markets and economic conditions
    throughout the world, including the current global economic and
    market instability. The global market and economic climate may
    continue to deteriorate because of many factors beyond our
    control, including continued economic instability and market
    volatility, sovereign debt issues, rising interest rates or
    inflation, terrorism or political uncertainty. In the event of a
    continued or future market downturn in general
     and/or  the
    biotechnology sector in particular, the market price of our
    common stock may be adversely affected.

In
    addition to the risks relating to our common stock, CVR holders
    are subject to additional risks.   

On October 15, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. in connection with our
    acquisition, contingent value rights or, CVRs, were issued under
    a CVR agreement entered into by and between us and American
    Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC, the trustee.
    A copy of the CVR agreement was filed on
     Form 8-A 
    with the SEC on October 15, 2010. Pursuant to the CVR
    agreement, each holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a  pro
    rata  portion, based on the number of CVRs then outstanding,
    of certain milestone and net sales payments, each of the
    following cash payments that we are obligated to pay. See
    Note 2, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K. 

In addition to the risks relating to our common stock, CVR
    holders are subject to additional risks, including:

an active public market for the CVRs may not develop or the CVRs
    may trade at low volumes, both of which could have an adverse
    effect on the resale price, if any, of the CVRs;

because a public market for the CVRs has a limited history, the
    market price and trading volume of the CVRs may be volatile;

if the clinical approval milestones specified in the CVR
    agreement are not achieved for any reason within the time
    periods specified therein, and if net sales do not exceed the
    thresholds set forth in the CVR agreement for any reason within
    the time periods specified therein, no payment will be made
    under the CVRs and the CVRs will expire valueless;

since the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the CVRs is
    unclear, any part of any CVR payment could be treated as
    ordinary income and required to be included in income prior to
    the receipt of the CVR payment;

any payments in respect of the CVRs are subordinated to the
    right of payment of certain indebtedness of ours;

we may under certain circumstances redeem the CVRs; and

upon expiration of our obligations to use diligent efforts to
    achieve each of the CVR milestones and to sell
    ABRAXANE   

    or any of the other Abraxis pipeline products, we may
    discontinue such efforts, which would have an adverse effect on
    the value, if any, of the CVRs.

Our
    business could be adversely affected if we are unable to service
    our obligations under our recently incurred
    indebtedness.   

On October 7, 2010, we issued a total of $1.25 billion
    principal amount of senior notes, consisting of the 2015 notes,
    the 2020 notes and the 2040 notes, collectively referred to as
    the notes. Our ability to pay interest on the notes, to repay
    the principal amount of the notes when due at maturity, to
    comply with the covenants of the notes or to

33

Table of Contents   

repurchase the notes if a change of control occurs will depend
    upon, among other things, continued commercial success of our
    products and other factors that affect our future financial and
    operating performance, including, without limitation, prevailing
    economic conditions and financial, business, and regulatory
    factors, many of which are beyond our control.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the
    debt service requirements under the notes, we may be forced to
    take actions such as:

restructuring or refinancing our debt, including the notes;

seeking additional debt or equity capital;

reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions,
    investments or capital expenditures; or

selling assets.

Such measures might not be successful and might not enable us to
    service our obligations under the notes. In addition, any such
    financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available
    on economically favorable terms.

A
    breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could
    subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our
    business.   

We rely upon our information technology systems and
    infrastructure for our business. The size and complexity of our
    computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown,
    malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy
    breaches by employees and others who access our systems may pose
    a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized
    persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken
    appropriate security measures to protect our data and
    information technology systems, there can be no assurance that
    our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems
    that could adversely affect our business.

We
    have certain charter and by-law provisions that may deter a
    third-party from acquiring us and may impede the
    stockholders  ability to remove and replace our management
    or board of directors.   

Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time,
    without further stockholder approval, up to
    5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the
    price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An
    issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party from
    acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
    Additionally, our board of directors has adopted certain
    amendments to our by-laws intended to strengthen the
    board s position in the event of a hostile takeover
    attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders 
    ability to remove and replace our management
     and/or  board
    of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of
    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an
    anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer
    of our common stock.

ITEM 2.      

PROPERTIES   

Our corporate headquarters are located in Summit, New Jersey and
    our international headquarters are located in Boudry,
    Switzerland. Summarized below are the locations, primary usage
    and approximate square footage of the facilities we own
    worldwide:

We occupy the following facilities, located in the United
    States, under operating lease arrangements that have remaining
    lease terms greater than one year. Under these lease
    arrangements, we also are required to reimburse the lessors for
    real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other
    operating costs. All leases are with unaffiliated parties.

We also lease a number of offices under various lease agreements
    outside of the United States for which the minimum annual rents
    may be subject to specified annual rent increases. At
    December 31, 2010, the non-cancelable lease terms for our
    operating leases expire at various dates between 2011 and 2018
    and in some cases include renewal options. The total amount of
    rent expense recorded for all leased facilities in 2010 was
    $30.1 million.

ITEM 3.      

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS   

We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various
    patent, commercial and other claims; government investigations;
    and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the
    ordinary course of our business. These legal proceedings and
    other matters are complex in nature and have outcomes that are
    difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company.

35

Table of Contents   

Patent proceedings include challenges to scope, validity or
    enforceability of our patents relating to our various products
    or processes. Although we believe we have substantial defenses
    to these challenges with respect to all our material patents,
    there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters,
    and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of
    patent protection for the drug at issue, which could lead to a
    significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially
    affect future results of operations.

Among the principal matters pending to which we are a party, are
    the following:

REVLIMID     

We have publicly announced that we have received a notice letter
    dated August 30, 2010, sent from Natco Pharma Limited of
    India ( Natco ) notifying us of a Paragraph IV
    certification alleging that patents listed for
    REVLIMID   

    in the Orange Book are invalid,
     and/or  not
    infringed (the Notice Letter). The Notice Letter was sent
    pursuant to Natco having filed an ANDA seeking permission from
    the FDA to market a generic version of 25mg, 15mg, 10mg and 5mg
    capsules of
    REVLIMID   .

    Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic
    manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a
     Paragraph IV certification ) challenging the
    validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDA s
     Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence
    Evaluations  (the  Orange Book ) four years after
    the pioneer company obtains approval of its New Drug
    Application, or an NDA. On October 8, 2010, Celgene filed
    an infringement action in the United States District Court of
    New Jersey against Natco in response to the Notice Letter with
    respect to United States Patent Nos. 5,635,517 (the
      517 patent ), 6,045,501 (the   501
    patent ), 6,281,230 (the   230 patent ),
    6,315,720 (the   720 patent ), 6,555,554 (the
      554 patent ), 6,561,976 (the   976
    patent ), 6,561,977 (the   977 patent ),
    6,755,784 (the   784 patent ), 7,119,106 (the
      106 patent ), and 7,465,800 (the
      800 patent ). If Natco is successful in
    challenging our patents listed in the Orange Book, and the FDA
    were to approve the ANDA with a comprehensive education and risk
    management program for a generic version of lenalidomide, sales
    of
    REVLIMID   

    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic lenalidomide product, potentially reducing
    our revenue.

Natco responded to our infringement action on November 18,
    2010, with its Answer, Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims.
    Natco has alleged (through affirmative defenses and
    counterclaims) that the patents are invalid, unenforceable
     and/or  not
    infringed by Natco s proposed generic productions. After
    filing the infringement action, we learned the identity of
    Natco s U.S. partner, Arrow International Limited, and
    filed an amended complaint on January 7, 2011, adding Arrow
    as a defendant.

ELAN
    PHARMA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  

On February 23, 2011, the parties entered into a settlement
    and license agreement for $78.0 million, whereby all claims
    were resolved and we obtained the rights to certain patents in
    and related to the litigation including rights to
    U.S. Reissue Patent REI 41,884 (the  Reissued
    Patent ), as well as all foreign counterparts, all of which
    expire in 2016. Prior to the settlement, on July 19, 2006,
    Elan Pharmaceutical Int l Ltd. filed a lawsuit against the
    predecessor entity of Abraxis ( Old Abraxis ) in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging
    that Old Abraxis willfully infringed two of its patents by
    making, using and selling the
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug. Elan sought unspecified damages and an injunction.
    In response, Old Abraxis contended that it did not infringe the
    Elan patents and that the Elan patents are invalid and
    unenforceable. Before trial, Elan dropped its claim that Old
    Abraxis infringed one of the two asserted patents. Elan also
    dropped its request for an injunction as to the remaining
    patent. On June 13, 2008, after a trial with respect to the
    remaining patent, a jury ruled that Old Abraxis had infringed
    that patent, that Abraxis  infringement was not willful,
    and that the patent was valid and enforceable. The jury awarded
    Elan $55.2 million in damages for sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    through the judgment date. For accounting purposes, Abraxis
    assumed approximately a 6% royalty on all U.S. sales, moving
    forward from the verdict, of
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug, plus interest. The patent expired on
    January 25, 2011.

ABRAXIS
    SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT  

Abraxis, the members of the Abraxis board of directors and
    Celgene Corporation are named as defendants in putative class
    action lawsuits brought by Abraxis stockholders challenging the
    Abraxis acquisition in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The
    plaintiffs in such actions assert claims for breaches of
    fiduciary duty arising out of the acquisition and allege that
    Abraxis  directors engaged in self-dealing and obtained for
    themselves personal benefits and failed to provide stockholders
    with material information relating to the acquisition. The
    plaintiffs also allege claims for aiding and abetting breaches
    of fiduciary duty against us and Abraxis.

On September 14, 2010, the parties reached an agreement in
    principle to settle the actions pursuant to the Memorandum of
    Understanding, or the MOU. Without admitting the validity of any
    allegations made in the actions, or any liability with respect
    thereto, the defendants elected to settle the actions in order
    to avoid the cost, disruption and distraction of further
    litigation. Under the MOU, the defendants agreed, among other
    things, to make additional disclosures relating to the
    acquisition, and to provide the plaintiffs  counsel with
    limited discovery to confirm the fairness and adequacy of the
    settlement. Abraxis, on behalf of itself and for the benefit of
    the other defendants in the actions, also agreed to pay the
    plaintiffs  counsel $600,000 for their fees and expenses.
    Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against us and Abraxis
    relating to our acquisition of Abraxis, except claims to enforce
    the settlement or properly perfected claims for appraisal in
    connection with the acquisition of Abraxis by us.

On November 15, 2010, the parties executed and filed a
    stipulation and settlement with the Court and plaintiffs filed a
    motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement.
    On January 26, 2011, the Court granted plaintiffs 
    motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement,
    certified the class for settlement purposes only and approved
    the form of notice of the settlement of the class action.

    January 27, 2011 reporting our financial results for the
    year ended December 31, 2010, adjustments were made to the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, resulting in a decrease in net income
    attributable to Celgene in the amount of $4.0 million and a
    reduction of $0.01 in basic net income per share attributable to
    Celgene for the year ended December 31, 2010. There was no
    change to the reported diluted net income per share attributable
    to Celgene for the year ended December 31, 2010.

MANAGEMENT S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS   

Executive
    Summary  

Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively
     we ,  our  or  us ) is a global
    integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the
    discovery, development and commercialization of innovative
    therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory
    related diseases.

Our primary commercial stage products include
    REVLIMID   ,

    VIDAZA   ,

    THALOMID   

    (inclusive of Thalidomide
    Celgene   

    and Thalidomide
    Pharmion   ),

    ABRAXANE   

    and
    ISTODAX   .

    REVLIMID   

    is an oral immunomodulatory drug primarily marketed in the
    United States and select international markets, in combination
    with dexamethasone, for treatment of patients with multiple
    myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and for the
    treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or
    intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS,
    associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or
    without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
    VIDAZA   ,

    which is licensed from Pfizer, is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog
    that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA
    hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re-expression.
    VIDAZA   

    is a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with
    intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the National
    Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN and is marketed in the
    United States for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS.
    VIDAZA   

    has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of
    MDS through May 2011. In Europe,
    VIDAZA   

    is marketed for the treatment of certain qualified adult
    patients and has been granted orphan drug designation for the
    treatment of MDS and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.
    THALOMID   

    is marketed for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
    and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of
    moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, an
    inflammatory complication of leprosy and as maintenance therapy
    for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of
    ENL recurrence.
    ABRAXANE   ,

    which was obtained in the 2010 acquisition of Abraxis BioScience
    Inc., or Abraxis, is a nanoparticle, albumin-bound paclitaxel
    that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
    or FDA, in January 2005 for the treatment of metastatic breast
    cancer.
    ABRAXANE   

    is based on a tumor-targeting platform known as
    nab   

    technology.
    ISTODAX   ,

    which was obtained in the 2010 acquisition of Gloucester
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Gloucester, was approved by the FDA
    for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, in
    patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.
    ISTODAX   

    has received both orphan drug designation for the treatment of
    non-Hodgkin s T-cell lymphomas, which includes CTCL and
    peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, and fast-track status in
    PTCL from the FDA. The European Agency for the Evaluation of
    Medicinal Products, or EMA, has granted orphan status
    designation for
    ISTODAX   

    for the treatment of both CTCL and PTCL. We also sell
    FOCALIN   ,

    which is approved for the treatment of attention deficit
    hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, exclusively to Novartis Pharma
    AG, or Novartis.

Additional sources of revenue include a licensing agreement with
    Novartis, which entitles us to royalties on FOCALIN
    XR   

    and the entire
    RITALIN   

    family of drugs, residual payments from GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK,
    based upon GSK s
    ALKERAN   

    revenues through the end of March 2011, sale of services through
    our Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary and other miscellaneous
    licensing agreements.

We continue to invest substantially in research and development,
    and the drug candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of
    preclinical and clinical development. These candidates include
    our
    IMiDs   

    compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and
    having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important
    properties, our leading oral anti-inflammatory agents and cell
    products and, after the acquisition of Abraxis, our
    nanoparticle, albumin-bound compounds. We believe that continued
    acceptance of our primary commercial stage products,
    participation in research and development collaboration
    arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, regulatory
    approvals of both new products and expanded use of existing
    products provide the catalysts for future growth.

The following table summarizes total revenue and earnings for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

Total revenue increased by $935.9 million in 2010 compared
    to 2009 primarily due to the continued growth of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   

    in both U.S. and international markets, in addition to
    sales of Gloucester and Abraxis products subsequent to their
    acquisition dates. Net income and diluted earnings per share for
    2010 reflects the higher level of revenue, partly offset by
    increased spending for new product launches, research and
    development activities, expansion of our international
    operations and additional costs related to the acquisitions of
    Gloucester and Abraxis. Net income for 2010 also included an
    $86.7 million increase in upfront payments related to
    research and development collaboration arrangements compared to
    2009.

Acquisition of Abraxis BioScience, Inc.:   On
    October 15, 2010, or the acquisition date, we acquired all
    of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis. The transaction,
    referred to as the Merger, resulted in Abraxis becoming our
    wholly owned subsidiary. The results of operations for Abraxis
    are included in our consolidated financial statements from the
    date of acquisition and the assets and liabilities of Abraxis
    have been recorded at their respective fair values on the
    acquisition date and consolidated with ours. Abraxis contributed
    net revenues of $88.5 million and losses of
    $43.0 million, after consideration of non-controlling
    interest, for the period from the acquisition date through
    December 31, 2010.

Prior to the Merger, Abraxis was a fully integrated global
    biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery, development
    and delivery of next-generation therapeutics and core
    technologies that offer patients treatments for cancer and other
    critical illnesses. Abraxis  portfolio includes an oncology
    compound,
    ABRAXANE   ,

    which is based on Abraxis  proprietary tumor-targeting
    platform known as
    nab   

    technology.
    ABRAXANE   ,

    the first FDA approved product to use the
    nab   

    technology, was launched in 2005 for the treatment of metastatic
    breast cancer. Abraxis has continued to expand the
    nab   

    technology through a clinical program and a product pipeline
    containing a number of
    nab   

    technology products in development. The acquisition of Abraxis
    accelerates our strategy to become a global leader in oncology
    by the addition of
    ABRAXANE   

    and the
    nab   

    technology to our portfolio.

Acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc.:   On January 15, 2010, we acquired all
    of the outstanding common stock and stock options of Gloucester.
    The results of operations for Gloucester are included in our
    consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition
    and the assets and liabilities of Gloucester have been recorded
    at their respective fair values on the acquisition date and
    consolidated with ours. Gloucester contributed net revenues of
    $15.8 million and losses of $50.3 million. Prior to
    the acquisition, Gloucester was a privately held
    biopharmaceutical company that acquired clinical-stage oncology
    drug candidates with the goal of advancing them through
    regulatory approval and commercialization. We acquired
    Gloucester to enhance our portfolio of therapies for patients
    with life-threatening illnesses worldwide.

Debt Issuance:   On October 7, 2010, we
    issued a total of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior
    notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015, or the 2015 notes,
    $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.95% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 2020 notes, and
    $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.7% Senior Notes due 2040, or the 2040 notes, and,
    together with the 2015 notes and the 2020 notes, referred to
    herein as the  notes.  The notes were issued at
    99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the
    discount is amortized as additional interest expense over the
    period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of
    approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt
    issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are
    amortized as additional interest expense using the effective
    interest rate method over the period from issuance through
    maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in
    arrears on April 15 and October 15 each year beginning
    April 15, 2011 and the principal on each note is due in
    full at their

43

Table of Contents   

respective maturity dates. The notes may be redeemed at our
    option, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price
    defined in a make-whole clause equaling accrued and unpaid
    interest plus the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the
    notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the
    remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal. If we
    experience a change of control accompanied by a downgrade of the
    debt to below investment grade, we will be required to offer to
    repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We are
    subject to covenants which limit our ability to pledge
    properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit
    our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving
    our property.

Results
    of Operations:  

Fiscal
    Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008  

Total Revenue:   Total revenue and related
    percentages for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were as follows:

Total revenue increased by $935.9 million, or 34.8%, to
    $3.626 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting
    increases of $456.4 million, or 26.3%, in the United
    States, and $479.5 million, or 50.1% in international
    markets. The $435.1 million, or 19.3%, increase in 2009
    compared to 2008, included increases of $150.3 million, or
    9.5%, in the United States and $284.8 million, or 42.3%, in
    international markets.

Net
    Product Sales:  

Total net product sales for 2010 increased by
    $941.1 million, or 36.7%, to $3.508 billion compared
    to 2009. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of
    $892.5 million, price decreases of $2.1 million and
    the favorable impact from foreign exchange of
    $50.7 million. The decrease in prices was primarily due to
    increased Medicaid rebates resulting from the Health Care Reform
    Act and an increase in rebates to U.S. and international
    governments resulting from their attempts to reduce health care
    costs.

Total net product sales for 2009 increased by
    $429.7 million, or 20.1%, to $2.567 billion compared
    to 2008. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of
    $428.0 million and price increases of $61.5 million,
    partly offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of
    $59.8 million.

REVLIMID   

    net sales increased by $762.7 million, or 44.7%, to
    $2.469 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to
    increased unit sales in both U.S. and international
    markets. Increased market penetration and the increase in
    treatment duration of patients using
    REVLIMID   

    in multiple myeloma contributed to U.S. growth. The

44

Table of Contents   

growth in international markets reflects the expansion of our
    commercial activities in over 65 countries in addition to
    product reimbursement approvals and the launch of
    REVLIMID   

    in Japan in the latter part of 2010.

Net sales of
    REVLIMID   

    increased by $381.8 million, or 28.8%, to
    $1.706 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was
    primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and
    international markets, reflecting increases in market
    penetration and duration of therapy in the United States, in
    addition to the expansion of our commercial activities in
    international markets.

VIDAZA   

    net sales increased by $147.1 million, or 38.0%, to
    $534.3 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to
    increased sales in international markets resulting from the
    completion of product launches in key European regions during
    the latter part of 2009 and the increase in treatment duration
    of patients using
    VIDAZA   .

Net sales of
    VIDAZA   

    increased by $180.5 million, or 87.3%, to
    $387.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
    the December 2008 full marketing authorization granted by the
    European Commission, or E.C., for the treatment of adult
    patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell
    transplantation with Intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according
    to the International Prognostic System Score, or IPSS, or
    chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, with
     10-29 percent 
    marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, or AML with
     20-30 percent 
    blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health
    Organization, or WHO, classification of
    VIDAZA   .

    In addition, sales for 2008 only included
    VIDAZA   

    sales subsequent to the March 7, 2008 acquisition of
    Pharmion.

THALOMID   

    net sales decreased by $47.3 million, or 10.8%, to
    $389.6 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to
    lower unit volumes in the United States resulting from the
    increased use of
    REVLIMID   .

Net sales of
    THALOMID   

    decreased by $67.8 million, or 13.4%, to
    $436.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was
    primarily due to lower unit volumes in the United States
    resulting from the increased use of
    REVLIMID   ,

    partially offset by higher pricing and volume increases in
    international markets.

ABRAXANE   

    was obtained in the acquisition of Abraxis in October 2010 and
    was approved by the FDA in January 2005 in the treatment of
    metastatic breast cancer.

ISTODAX   

    was obtained in the acquisition of Gloucester in January 2010
    and was approved in November 2009 by the FDA for the treatment
    of CTCL in patients who have received at least one prior
    systemic therapy.
    ISTODAX   

    was launched in the first quarter of 2010.

ALKERAN   

    net sales decreased by $61.6 million, or 75.4%, to
    $20.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008. This product was
    licensed from GSK and sold under our label through
    March 31, 2009, the conclusion date of the
    ALKERAN   

    license with GSK.

The  other  net product sales category for 2010
    includes sales of
    FOCALIN   

    and former Pharmion and Abraxis products to be divested. The
     other  net product sales category for 2009 includes
    sales of
    FOCALIN   

    and former Pharmion products to be divested.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals:   We record gross
    to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales
    discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and distributor
    service fees.

REVLIMID   

    is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted
    pharmacies under the
    RevAssist   

    program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution
    program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and
    appropriate distribution and use of
    REVLIMID   .

    Internationally,
    REVLIMID   

    is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution
    programs tailored to meet local competent authorities 
    specifications to help ensure the product s safe and
    appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by
    country and, depending upon the country and the design of the
    risk-management program, the product may be sold through
    hospitals or retail pharmacies.
    THALOMID   

    is distributed in the United States under our   System
    for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety,   or
    S.T.E.P.S.   ,

    program which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive
    education and risk-management distribution program with the
    objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution
    and use of
    THALOMID   .

    Internationally,
    THALOMID   

    is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution
    programs tailored to meet local competent authorities 
    specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate
    distribution and use of
    THALOMID   .

    These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the
    country and

45

Table of Contents   

the design of the risk-management program, the product may be
    sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.
    VIDAZA   

    and
    ABRAXANE   

    are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical
    industry supply chain and are not subject to the same
    risk-management distribution programs as
    THALOMID   

    and
    REVLIMID   .

We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand
    retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as
    reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and
    other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where
    product is still being returned or inventory centralization and
    rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains,
    as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these
    estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change
    in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a
    determination is made and revenues in that period could be
    materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual
    returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots,
    that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are
    analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on
    open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are
    monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any
    changes from the historical trend rates are considered in
    determining the current sales return allowance.
    REVLIMID   

    is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted
    pharmacies, lending itself to tighter controls of inventory
    quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in
    lower returns activity to date.
    THALOMID   

    is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a
    result, wholesalers do not stock the product.

Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to
    customers.

Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due
    to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties
    under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate
    accruals are generally based on historical payment data and
    estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to
    the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for
    Medicaid and Medicare Services. Full year 2010 revenues were
    negatively impacted by the U.S. Health Care Reform Act
    which increased the Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and
    extended that rebate to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We
    utilized historical patient data to estimate the incremental
    costs related to the Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. In
    addition, certain international markets have
    government-sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid
    based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate
    accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.

Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale
    customers, GPOs and end-user customers, consistent with
    pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and
    fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from date of
    sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale
    based on the contracted rates and historical redemption rates.
    Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of
    wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average
    contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to
    these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.

Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between
    product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower
    government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered
    under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee
    accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the
    wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health
    care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military
    Health System that provides civilian health benefits for
    military personnel, military retirees and their dependents.
    TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated Department of
    Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.

See Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting
    Policies for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.

Table of Contents   

Gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related
    allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 were as follows:

2010 compared to 2009:   Returns and allowances
    decreased by $8.3 million in 2010 compared to 2009,
    primarily due to reduced U.S. provisions resulting from
    decreased revenue from products with higher return rates.

Discounts increased by $15.7 million in 2010 compared to
    2009, primarily due to revenue increases in the United States
    and international markets, both of which offer different
    discount programs, and expansion into new international markets.

Government rebates increased by $69.7 million in 2010
    compared to 2009, primarily due to an approximate
    $28.4 million increase in Medicaid rebates resulting from
    the Health Care Reform Act, $40.6 million from
    reimbursement rate increases in certain international markets
    and approvals in new markets and the inclusion of
    ABRAXANE   

    sales subsequent to the October 2010 acquisition of Abraxis.

Chargebacks and distributor service fees increased by
    $34.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a
    $17.7 million increase in chargebacks resulting from both
    an increase in sales, including the addition of
    ABRAXANE   ,

    and an increase in certain chargeback rates, which are closely
    aligned with Medicaid rebate rates. Other increases included
    $5.6 million from TRICARE due to increased utilization in
    the current year, distributor service fees of $6.5 million
    and $2.3 million resulting from the Health Care Reform Act.

2009 compared to 2008:   Returns and allowances
    decreased by $5.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008
    primarily due to the completion of an inventory centralization
    and rationalization initiative conducted by a major pharmacy
    chain during 2009, decreased revenue from products with a higher
    return rate history in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in
    ALKERAN   

    returns due to the March 31, 2009 conclusion of the
    ALKERAN   

    license with GSK. In addition, 2008 includes an increase in
    THALOMID   

    returns resulting from the anticipated increase in the use of
    REVLIMID   

    in multiple myeloma.

47

Table of Contents   

Discounts increased by $1.3 million in 2009 compared to
    2008 primarily due to revenue increases in the United States and
    international markets, both of which offer different discount
    programs.

Government rebates increased by $12.6 million in 2009
    compared to 2008 primarily due to increased sales levels of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   

    in the United States and international markets, as well as
    reimbursement approvals in new markets.

Chargebacks and distributor service fees decreased by
    $11.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
    reduced revenue from products with a higher chargeback history
    in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in
    ALKERAN   

    chargebacks, partially offset by an increase in international
    distributor service fees due to certain programs commenced in
    2009.

Collaborative Agreements and Other
    Revenue:   Revenues from collaborative agreements
    and other sources decreased by $3.2 million to
    $10.5 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was
    primarily due to receipt of a $5.0 million milestone
    payment in 2009 which was not duplicated in 2010, partly offset
    by an increase in licensing fees and the inclusion of Abraxis
    other revenues subsequent to the October 2010 acquisition date.

Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources
    decreased by $1.2 million to $13.7 million in 2009
    compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the
    elimination of license fees and amortization of deferred
    revenues related to Pharmion subsequent to the March 7,
    2008 acquisition and was partly offset by an increase in
    milestone payments received in 2009.

Royalty Revenue:   Royalty revenue decreased by
    $2.0 million to $106.8 million in 2010 compared to
    2009. A $5.9 million decrease in residual payments earned
    by us based upon GSK s
    ALKERAN   

    revenues subsequent to the conclusion of the
    ALKERAN   

    license with GSK was partly offset by a net $3.9 million
    increase in royalties earned from Novartis based upon its
    FOCALIN
    XR   

    and
    RITALIN   

    sales.

Royalty revenue increased by $6.6 million to
    $108.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
    the 2009 inclusion of $9.0 million in residual
    ALKERAN   

    payments earned by us based upon GSK s
    ALKERAN   

    revenues subsequent to the conclusion of the
    ALKERAN   

    license with GSK. Royalty revenue related to Novartis 
    sales of
    RITALIN   

    decreased by $2.1 million from 2008.

Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired
    intangible assets):   Cost of goods sold and
    related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired
    intangible assets) increased by $90.2 million to
    $306.5 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was
    primarily due to the inclusion of a $34.7 million inventory
     step-up 
    amortization adjustment related to sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    subsequent to the October 15, 2010 acquisition date of
    Abraxis, in addition to increased sales of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   ,

    partly offset by the elimination of higher cost
    ALKERAN   

    sales, resulting from the March 31, 2009 conclusion of the
    GSK license agreement. As a percent of net product sales, cost
    of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible
    assets) increased to 8.7% in the 2010 compared to 8.4% in 2009
    primarily due to the inventory
     step-up 
    amortization for
    ABRAXANE   .

    Excluding the
     step-up 
    adjustment, the cost of goods sold ratio for 2010 was 7.7%.

Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired
    intangible assets) decreased by $42.0 million to
    $216.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008 partly due to the
    March 31, 2009 conclusion date of the
    ALKERAN   

    license with GSK, reducing cost of goods sold by approximately
    $39.0 million compared to 2008. In addition, costs related
    to
    THALOMID   

    decreased as a result of lower unit volumes. Finally, 2008
    included a $24.6 million inventory
     step-up 
    adjustment related to the March 7, 2008 acquisition of
    Pharmion compared to an adjustment of $0.4 million included
    in 2009. The impact of these reductions was partly offset by
    higher costs related to increased

48

Table of Contents   

unit volumes for
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   .

    As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding
    amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 8.4% in
    2009 from 12.1% in 2008 primarily due to lower
    ALKERAN   

    sales, which carried a higher cost to sales ratio relative to
    our other products, and the decrease in the inventory
     step-up 
    adjustment.

Research and Development:   Research and
    development expenses and related percentages for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Research and development expenses increased by
    $333.6 million to $1.128 billion in 2010 compared to
    2009, partly due to an increase of $86.7 million in upfront
    payments related to research and development collaboration
    arrangements. A $121.2 million upfront payment was made to
    Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Agios, in 2010, compared to a
    combined $34.5 million in payments made to GlobeImmune,
    Inc., or GlobeImmune, and Array BioPharma, Inc., or Array, in
    2009. In addition, 2010 included $65.6 million in expenses
    related to Abraxis and Gloucester subsequent to their
    acquisition dates, an increase of approximately
    $55.0 million in salary and benefits related to an increase
    in employees, an increase of approximately $50.0 million in
    research and development project spending and increases in
    spending in support of multiple programs across a broad range of
    diseases.

Research and development expenses decreased by
    $136.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a
    $303.1 million charge included in 2008 for a royalty
    obligation payment to Pfizer that related to the yet to be
    approved forms of
    VIDAZA   

    partly offset by 2009 spending increases related to drug
    discovery and clinical research and development in support of
    multiple programs across a broad range of diseases. Included in
    2009 were upfront payments of $30.0 million and
    $4.5 million to GlobeImmune and Array, respectively,
    related to research and development collaboration agreements.
    Included in 2008 was an upfront payment of $45.0 million
    made to Acceleron Pharma, Inc. related to a research and
    development collaboration agreement.

The following table provides a breakdown of research and
    development expenses:

(1)  

Other pharmaceutical programs include spending for toxicology,
    analytical research and development, quality and regulatory
    affairs and upfront payments for research and development
    collaboration arrangements. 

Research and development expenditures support multiple ongoing
    clinical proprietary development programs for
    REVLIMID   

    and  other
    IMiDs   

    compounds;
    VIDAZA   ;

    ABRAXANE   

    in melanoma, non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancers; ABI
    compounds, which are targeted nanoparticle, albumin-bound
    compounds for treatment of solid tumor cancers; amrubicin, our
    lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast (CC-10004),
    our lead anti-inflammatory compound that inhibits multiple
    proinflammatory mediators and which is currently being evaluated
    in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of psoriasis
    and psoriatic arthritis; pomalidomide, which is currently being
    evaluated in Phase I, II and III clinical trials;
    CC-11050, for which Phase II clinical trials are planned;
    our kinase inhibitor programs; as well as our cell therapy
    programs.

Selling, General and Administrative:   Selling,
    general and administrative expenses and related percentages for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as
    follows:

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $196.8 million to $950.6 million in 2010 compared to
    2009, partly due to the inclusion of $50.0 million in
    expenses related to former Abraxis and Gloucester subsequent to
    their acquisition dates, a $19.1 million increase in
    facilities costs and a $11.7 million increase in donations
    to non-profit foundations. The remaining increase includes
    higher marketing and sales related expenses, resulting from
    ongoing product launch activities of
    VIDAZA   

    in Europe and
    ISTODAX   

    in the United States, in addition to the continued expansion of
    our international commercial activities and an increase in
    facilities costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
    $68.3 million to $753.8 million in 2009 compared to
    2008, primarily reflecting increases in marketing and sales
    related expenses of $75.1 million, which were partly offset
    by a $6.7 million reduction in bad debt expense and other
    customer account charges. Marketing and sales related expenses
    in 2009 included product launch activities for
    REVLIMID   ,

    VIDAZA   

    and
    THALOMID   

    in Europe, Canada and Australia, in addition to
    VIDAZA   

    relaunch expenses in the United States upon receipt of an
    expanded FDA approval to reflect new overall survival data. The
    increase in expense also reflects the continued expansion of our
    international commercial activities.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible
    Assets:   Amortization of acquired intangible
    assets is summarized below for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008:

Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased by
    $119.8 million to $203.2 million in 2010 compared to
    2009, primarily due to $95.8 million of incremental expense
    associated with an acceleration of amortization beginning in
    2010 related to the
    VIDAZA   

    intangible resulting from the acquisition of Pharmion. The
    revised monthly amortization reflects an updated sales forecast
    related to
    VIDAZA   .

    An increase in amortization expense due to the initiation of
    amortization related to the Abraxis and Gloucester acquired
    intangibles was partly offset by a reduction in expense
    associated with certain developed product rights obtained in the
    Pharmion acquisition becoming fully amortized during 2009.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by
    $20.6 million to $83.4 million in 2009 compared to
    2008 primarily due to several intangible assets obtained in the
    Pharmion acquisition in March 2008 becoming fully amortized
    during the fourth quarter of 2008 and third quarter of 2009.

Acquisition Related Charges and Restructuring,
    net:   Acquisition related charges and
    restructuring, net was $47.2 million in 2010 and included
    $22.7 million in accretion of the contingent consideration
    related to the acquisition of Gloucester in January 2010 and
    $24.5 million in net costs related to the acquisition of
    Abraxis in October 2010. In addition to acquisition related fees
    of $21.4 million, the costs related to Abraxis included
    restructuring costs of $16.1 million, partly offset by a
    $13.0 favorable adjustment to the fair value of our liability
    related to publicly traded contingent value rights, or CVRs,
    that were issued as part of the acquisition of Abraxis. The
    restructuring costs are primarily severance related and are
    expected to be incurred in both 2011 and 2012.

Interest and Investment Income, Net:   Interest
    and investment income, net is summarized below for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

Interest and investment income, net decreased by
    $32.0 million to $44.8 million in 2010 compared to
    2009. The decrease was primarily due to a $19.6 million net
    reduction in gains on sales of marketable securities in 2010
    compared to 2009 and a $13.6 million reduction in interest
    income due to lower overall yields and the liquidation of
    securities to fund the Abraxis acquisition.

Interest and investment income decreased by $8.1 million to
    $76.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
    reduced yields on invested balances, partly offset by higher
    invested balances.

Equity in Losses of Affiliated
    Companies:   Under the equity method of accounting,
    we recorded losses of $1.9 million, $1.1 million and
    $9.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The loss
    for 2010 included $1.3 million in losses from former
    Abraxis equity method investments. The loss for 2008 included
    impairment losses of $6.0 million which were based on an
    evaluation of several factors, including an
     other-than-temporary 
    decrease in fair value of an equity method investment below our
    cost.

Interest Expense:   Interest expense was
    $12.6 million, $2.0 million and $4.4 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $10.6 million
    increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the interest
    accrued on the $1.25 billion in senior notes issued in
    October 2010.

Other income, net:   Other income, net is
    summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008:

Other income, net decreased by $67.7 million in 2010 to a
    net expense of $7.2 million compared to an income of
    $60.5 million in 2009 primarily due to a reduction in net
    gains on foreign currency forward contracts that had not been
    designated as hedges entered into in order to offset net foreign
    exchange gains and losses.

Other income increased by $35.7 million to
    $60.5 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
    transaction exchange gains and net gains on foreign currency
    forward contracts that had not been designated as hedges. In
    addition, 2008 included an impairment loss of $4.1 million.

Income Tax Provision:   The income tax provision
    decreased by $66.5 million to $132.4 million in 2010
    compared to 2009. The 2010 effective tax rate of 13.1% reflects
    the impact from our low tax Swiss manufacturing operations, our
    overall global mix of income, and tax deductions related to our
    acquisitions. The income tax provision in 2010 includes the
    favorable impact of a shift in earnings between the
    U.S. and lower tax foreign jurisdictions. The income tax
    provision in 2010 also includes certain discrete items including
    a tax benefit of $12.5 million related to the settlement of
    a tax examination, a tax benefit of $5.4 million which was
    primarily the result of filing our 2009 income tax returns with
    certain items being more favorable than originally estimated,
    and a tax benefit of $19.8 million for the reduction in a
    valuation allowance related to certain tax carryforwards,
    partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits
    related to certain ongoing income tax audits.

The income tax provision increased by $34.2 million to
    $199.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The 2009 effective
    tax rate of 20.4% reflected the impact from our low tax Swiss
    manufacturing operations and our overall global mix of income.
    The income tax provision in 2009 included the favorable impact
    of a shift in earnings between the U.S. and lower tax
    foreign jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2009 also
    included a $17.0 million net tax benefit which was
    primarily the result of filing our 2008 income tax returns with
    certain items being more

51

favorable than originally estimated, the reduction in a
    valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards, and
    the settlement of tax examinations, partially offset by an
    increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to certain ongoing
    income tax audits.

Net income (loss):   Net income (loss) and per
    common share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 were as follows:

(1)  

In computing diluted earnings per share for 2008, no adjustment
    to the numerator or denominator was made due to the
    anti-dilutive effect of any potential common stock as a result
    of our net loss. As of their maturity date, June 1, 2008,
    substantially all of our convertible notes were converted into
    shares of common stock. 

Net income for 2010 reflect the earnings impact from higher
    sales of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   .

    The favorable impact of higher revenues was partly offset by
    increased spending for new product launches, research and
    development activities, expansion of our international
    operations and the additional costs and intangible amortization
    related to acquisitions.

Net income for 2009 reflects the earnings impact from higher
    sales of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   ,

    which was partly due to sales increases in the United States and
    our continued expansion into new international markets and the
    granting of full marketing authorization by the European
    Commission, or E.C., of
    VIDAZA   

    for specified treatment of adult patients. The earnings
    generated from increased sales were partly offset by increased
    spending on research and development, the costs related to new
    product launches and our ongoing expansion of international
    operations. The net loss for 2008 included $1.74 billion in
    IPR D charges related to our acquisition of Pharmion and a
    $303.1 million charge for the October 2008 royalty
    obligation payment to Pfizer related to unapproved forms of
    VIDAZA   .

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources  

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    as follows:

Operating Activities:   Net cash provided by
    operating activities in 2010 increased by $271.7 million to
    $1,181.6 million as compared to 2009. The increase in net
    cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable
    to an expansion of our operations and related increase in net
    earnings, partially offset by the increase in accounts
    receivable associated with expanding international sales, which
    take longer to collect and the timing of receipts and payments
    in the ordinary course of business.

52

Table of Contents   

Investing Activities:   Net cash used in
    investing activities in 2010 increased by $1.251 billion to
    $2.107 billion as compared to a net cash use of
    $856.1 million in 2009. The 2010 investing activities are
    principally related to proceeds from the sales of marketable
    securities that were sold in preparation for the purchase of
    Abraxis and net cash used in the acquisition of Abraxis of
    $2.315 billion and the acquisition of Gloucester of
    $337.6 million. Net sales of marketable securities
    available for sale amounted to $659.7 million in 2010
    compared to net purchases of $749.3 million in 2009.

Financing Activities:   Net cash provided by
    financing activities in 2010 was $1.177 billion compared to
    a net cash usage of $61.9 million in 2009. The
    $1.239 billion increase in net cash provided by financing
    activities in 2010 was primarily attributable to proceeds from
    the issuance of long-term debt in 2010 that provided net cash of
    $1.237 billion.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities Available for
    Sale and Working Capital :  Cash, cash equivalents,
    marketable securities available for sale and working capital for
    the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

(1)  

Includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
    available for sale, accounts receivable, net of allowances,
    inventory and other current assets, less accounts payable,
    accrued expenses, income taxes payable and other current
    liabilities. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available
    for Sale:   We invest our excess cash primarily in
    money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
    securities,
     non-U.S. government, 
    agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt
    securities. All liquid investments with maturities of three
    months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash
    equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than
    three months from the date of purchase are classified as
    marketable securities available for sale. We determine the
    appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt
    and equity securities at the time of purchase. The
    $395.5 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and
    marketable securities available for sale at the end of 2010
    compared to 2009 was primarily due to the $2.315 billion
    net cash payment made for the Abraxis acquisition,
    $337.6 million net cash payment made for the Gloucester
    acquisition, $121.2 million upfront payment made to Agios
    related to a research and development collaboration arrangement
    and $183.1 million cash paid out under our share repurchase
    program announced in April 2009, partly offset by
    $1.237 billion in net proceeds from our debt issuance in
    October 2010 and cash generated from operations.

Accounts Receivable, Net:   Accounts receivable,
    net increased by $267.8 million to $706.4 million in
    2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased U.S. and
    international sales of
    REVLIMID   

    and
    VIDAZA   

    among existing customers as well as new customers in countries
    we have recently entered and the inclusion of $52.7 million
    in accounts receivable related to our acquisition of Abraxis in
    October 2010. Days of sales outstanding at the end of 2010
    increased to 59 days compared to 56 days in 2009. The
    increase in days of sales outstanding was primarily due to
    increased international sales in countries where payment terms
    are typically greater than 60 days, thereby extending
    collection periods beyond those in the United States. We expect
    this trend to continue as our international sales continue to
    expand.

Inventory:   Inventory balances increased by
    $159.4 million to $260.1 million at the end of 2010
    compared to 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of
    $136.7 million in
    ABRAXANE   

    inventory, which included a $90.3 million inventory
     step-up 
    adjustment to fair value resulting from the acquisition of
    Abraxis in October 2010.

Other Current Assets:   Other current assets
    increased by $16.1 million to $275.0 million at the
    end of 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increases in
    prepaid value added taxes, income taxes and an increase in the
    fair

53

Table of Contents   

value of foreign currency forward contracts, partly offset by a
    decrease in prepaid royalties related to
    VIDAZA   

    sales and interest receivable on short-term investments.

Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Current
    Liabilities:   Accounts payable, accrued expenses
    and other current liabilities increased by $550.0 million
    to $996.0 million at the end of 2010 compared to 2009. The
    increase was primarily due to the $171.9 million current
    portion of the contingent consideration related to the
    acquisition of Gloucester, increases in governmental rebates and
    Medicaid reimbursements, increased value added taxes, increased
    royalties and payroll-related and other accruals.

Income Taxes Payable (Current and
    Non-Current):   Income taxes payable increased by
    $94.1 million to $563.3 million at the end of 2010
    compared to 2009 primarily from the current provision for income
    taxes of $236.3 million, mostly offset by tax payments of
    $122.0 million and a tax benefit of stock options of
    $32.5 million.

We expect continued growth in our expenditures, particularly
    those related to research and development, clinical trials,
    commercialization of new products, international expansion and
    capital investments. However, we anticipate that existing cash
    and cash equivalent balances and marketable securities available
    for sale combined with cash generated from future net product
    sales, will provide sufficient capital resources to fund our
    normal operations for the foreseeable future.

Contractual
    Obligations  

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of
    December 31, 2010:

Senior Notes:   On October 7, 2010, we
    issued a total of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior
    notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015 (the  2015
    notes ), $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.95% Senior Notes due 2020 (the  2020 notes )
    and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.7% Senior Notes due 2040 (the  2040 notes  and,
    together with the 2015 notes and the 2020 notes, referred to
    herein as the  notes ). The notes were issued at
    99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the
    discount will be amortized as additional interest expense over
    the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of
    approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt
    issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are
    amortized as additional interest expense using the effective
    interest rate method over the period from issuance through
    maturity.

Operating leases:   We lease office and research
    facilities under various operating lease agreements in the
    United States and various international markets. The
    non-cancelable lease terms for the operating leases expire at
    various dates between 2010 and 2018 and include renewal options.
    In general, we are also required to reimburse the lessors for
    real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other
    operating costs associated with the leases. For more information
    on the major facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements
    refer to Part I, Item 2,  Properties  of
    this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K. 

Manufacturing Facility Note Payable:   In
    December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and
    certain other assets and liabilities from Siegfried Ltd. and
    Siegfried Dienste AG (together referred to herein as Siegfried)
    located in Zofingen, Switzerland. At December 31, 2010, the
    fair value of our note payable to Siegfried approximated the
    carrying value of the note of $25.0 million.

    commitments include $362.5 million in contractual
    obligations related to product supply contracts. In addition, we
    have committed to invest $20.0 million in an investment
    fund over a ten-year period, which is callable at any time. On
    December 31, 2010, our remaining investment commitment was
    $8.0 million. For more information refer to Note 19 of
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K. 

Collaboration Arrangements:   Potential
    milestone payments total approximately $3.8 billion,
    including approximately $2.3 billion contingent on the
    achievement of various research, development and regulatory
    approval milestones and approximately $1.5 billion in
    sales-based milestones.

We have entered into certain research and development
    collaboration agreements, as identified in Note 18 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual
    Report on
     Form 10-K, 
    with third parties that include the funding of certain
    development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with
    the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the
    achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory
     and/or 
    commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these efforts is
    contingent upon continued involvement in the programs
     and/or  the
    lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance
    of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the
    future potential payments are inherently uncertain, and
    accordingly no amounts have been recorded in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 contained in
    this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K. 

New
    Accounting Principles  

New Accounting Pronouncements:   In October
    2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
    Accounting Standard Update, or ASU,
     No. 2009-13, 
     Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,  or ASU
     2009-13, 
    which amends existing revenue recognition accounting
    pronouncements that are currently within the scope of FASB
    Accounting Standards
    Codification  tm  ,

    or ASC, 605. This guidance eliminates the requirement to
    establish the fair value of undelivered products and services
    and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon
    management s estimate of the selling price for an
    undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the
    fair value of that undelivered item. ASU
     2009-13  is
    effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if
    any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-06, 
     Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements, 
    or ASU
     2010-06, 
    which amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for
    disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2
    and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and
    settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU
     2010-06  also
    clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of
    disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value. Further, ASU
     2010-06 
    amends guidance on employers  disclosures about
    postretirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715 to require
    that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by
    major categories of assets. ASU
     2010-06  was
    effective for the first reporting period (including interim
    periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the
    requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases,
    sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will
    be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
    adoption is permitted. The section of the amendment pertaining
    to transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 was effective
    for us beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of this
    section of the amendment did not have any impact on our
    consolidated financial statements. The section of the amendment
    pertaining to Level 3 measurements will be effective for us
    beginning January 1, 2011. We are currently evaluating the
    impact, if any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-17, 
     Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition,  or ASU
     2010-17,  to
    (1) limit the scope of this ASU to research or development
    arrangements and (2) require that guidance in this ASU be
    met for an entity to apply the milestone method (record the
    milestone payment in its entirety in the period received).
    However, the FASB clarified that, even if the requirements in
    ASU  2010-17 
    are met, entities would not be precluded from making an
    accounting policy election to apply another appropriate
    accounting policy that results in the deferral of some portion
    of the arrangement consideration. The guidance in ASU
     2010-17  will
    apply to milestones in both single-deliverable and
    multiple-deliverable arrangements involving research or

55

Table of Contents   

development transactions. ASU
     2010-17  will
    be effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those
    fiscal years) beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early
    application is permitted. Entities can apply this guidance
    prospectively to milestones achieved after adoption. However,
    retrospective application to all prior periods is also
    permitted. The adoption of this accounting standard will not
    have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-27, 
     Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Pharmaceutical
    Manufacturers,  or ASU
     2010-27.  ASU
     2010-27 
    provides guidance concerning the recognition and classification
    of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug
    manufactures and importers on branded prescription drugs which
    was mandated under the U.S. Health Care Reform Act enacted
    in the United States in March 2010. Under this new accounting
    standard, the annual fee would be presented as a component of
    operating expenses and recognized over the calendar year. Such
    fees are payable using a straight-line method of allocation
    unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar
    year. This ASU is effective for calendar years beginning on or
    after December 31, 2010. As this standard relates only to
    classification, the adoption of this accounting standard will
    not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-29, 
     Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information, 
    or ASU
     2010-29.  ASU
     2010-29 
    clarifies disclosure requirements to require public entities
    that enter into business combinations that are material on an
    individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information
    for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting
    period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined
    entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the
    beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
    ASU  2010-29 
    is effective for material business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011 and early
    adoption is permitted. We have chosen early adoption of ASU
     2010-29  and
    the pro forma information related to our acquisitions of Abraxis
    and Gloucester complies with the provisions of this standard
    (See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements
    contained in this Annual Report on
     Form 10-K). 

Critical
    Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting
    Policies  

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to
    the portrayal of our financial condition and results of
    operation and requires management s most difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need
    to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
    inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies
    are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual
    Report, we believe the following accounting estimates and
    policies to be critical:

Revenue Recognition:   Revenue from the sale of
    products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the
    product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for
    discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and
    distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry
    are provided for in the same period the related sales are
    recorded. We record estimated reductions to revenue for
    volume-based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial
    sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such volume-based
    discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms, historical
    experience and trend analysis.

We recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees 
    sales of our products or products using our technologies.
    Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the
    contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably
    estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured. If royalties
    cannot be reasonably estimated or collectibility of a royalty
    amount is not reasonably assured, royalties are recognized as
    revenue when the cash is received.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals:   We record gross
    to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales
    discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and distributor
    service fees.

REVLIMID   

    is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted
    pharmacies under the
    RevAssist   

    program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution
    program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and
    appropriate distribution and use of
    REVLIMID   .

    Internationally,
    REVLIMID   

    is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution
    programs tailored to meet local competent authorities 
    specifications to help ensure the product s safe and
    appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by
    country and, depending upon the country and the design of the
    risk-management program, the product may be sold through
    hospitals or retail

56

Table of Contents   

pharmacies.
    THALOMID   

    is distributed in the United States under our
    S.T.E.P.S.   

    program which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive
    education and risk-management distribution program with the
    objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution
    and use of
    THALOMID   .

    Internationally,
    THALOMID   

    is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution
    programs tailored to meet local competent authorities 
    specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate
    distribution and use of
    THALOMID   .

    These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the
    country and the design of the risk-management program, the
    product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.
    VIDAZA   

    and
    ABRAXANE   

    are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical
    industry supply chain and are not subject to the same
    risk-management distribution programs as
    THALOMID   

    and
    REVLIMID   .

We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand
    retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as
    reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and
    other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where
    product is still being returned or inventory centralization and
    rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains,
    as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these
    estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change
    in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a
    determination is made and revenues in that period could be
    materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual
    returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots,
    that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are
    analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on
    open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are
    monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any
    changes from the historical trend rates are considered in
    determining the current sales return allowance.
    REVLIMID   

    is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted
    pharmacies, lending itself to tighter controls of inventory
    quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in
    lower returns activity to date.
    THALOMID   

    is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a
    result, wholesalers do not stock the product.

Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to
    customers.

Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due
    to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties
    under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate
    accruals are generally based on historical payment data and
    estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to
    the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for
    Medicaid and Medicare Services. Full year 2010 revenues were
    negatively impacted by the U.S. Health Care Reform Act
    which increased the Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and
    extended that rebate to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We
    utilized historical patient data to estimate the incremental
    costs related to the Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. In
    addition, certain international markets have
    government-sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid
    based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate
    accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.

Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale
    customers, GPOs and end-user customers, consistent with
    pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and
    fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from date of
    sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale
    based on the contracted rates and historical redemption rates.
    Upon receipt of chargeback, due to the availability of product
    and customer specific information on these programs, we then
    establish a specific provision for fees or rebates based on the
    specific terms of each agreement.

Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between
    product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower
    government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered
    under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee
    accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the
    wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health
    care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military
    Health System that provides civilian health benefits for
    military personnel, military retirees and their dependents.
    TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated Department of
    Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.

Income Taxes:   We utilize the asset and
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
    method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
    on the difference between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences
    are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when
    it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be
    realized.

57

Table of Contents   

We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions as part of our provision for income taxes. These
    unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common
    among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a
    variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include
    studies performed by independent economists, advice from
    industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken
    by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing
    authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide
    estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. If our estimates are
    not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations
    could be materially impacted.

We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of
    deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these
    deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we
    believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors
    when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred
    tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience
    by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income,
    carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,
    various income tax strategies and other relevant factors.
    Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and,
    to the extent future expectations change, we would have to
    assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that
    time. At December 31, 2010, it was more likely than not
    that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation
    allowances.

Share-Based Compensation:   The cost of
    share-based compensation is recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations based on the fair value of all awards
    granted, using the Black-Scholes method of valuation. The fair
    value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is
    recognized over the service period required to obtain full
    vesting. Compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate
    of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into
    consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual
    experience.

Other-Than-Temporary 
    Impairments of
     Available-For-Sale 
    Marketable Securities:   A decline in the market
    value of any
     available-for-sale 
    marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be
     other-than-temporary 
    results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The
    impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the
    security established. The determination of whether an
     available-for-sale 
    marketable security is
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired requires significant judgment and requires
    consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence
    in evaluating the potential impairment. Factors evaluated to
    determine whether the investment is
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired include: significant deterioration in the issuer s
    earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business
    prospects of the issuer, adverse changes in the general market
    conditions in which the issuer operates, length of time that the
    fair value has been below our cost, our expected future cash
    flows from the security, our intent not to sell and an
    evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will
    not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis. Assumptions
    associated with these factors are subject to future market and
    economic conditions, which could differ from our assessment.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities:   All
    derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at
    their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or
    other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a
    derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging
    transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging transaction. For
    a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout
    the hedged period, we formally document the nature and
    relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item.
    We assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether
    the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging
    transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in
    cash flows of hedged items. We assess hedge effectiveness on a
    quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the
    ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if any, to
    current earnings. If we determine that a forecasted transaction
    is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge
    accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the
    derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. We use
    derivative instruments, including those not designated as part
    of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to movements in
    foreign exchange and interest rates. The use of these derivative
    instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent
    to reduce our risk or cost. We do not use derivative instruments
    for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to
    leveraged derivatives.

Investment in Affiliated Companies:   We apply
    the equity method of accounting to our investment in common
    stock of an affiliated company and certain investment funds,
    which primarily invest in companies conducting business in life
    sciences such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical
    technology, medical devices, diagnostics and health and wellness.

58

Table of Contents   

Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible
    impairment. If an investment s fair value is determined to
    be less than its net carrying value and the decline is
    determined to be
     other-than-temporary, 
    the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an
    evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and
    circumstances. Factors considered in determining whether an
     other-than-temporary 
    decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit
    price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or
    future rounds of financing by the investee; length of time that
    the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition
    and business prospects of the investee; our intent and ability
    to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to
    allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues
    that raise concerns about the investee s ability to
    continue as a going concern; and any other information that we
    may be aware of related to the investment.

Accounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans:   We
    have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed
    to provide key officers and executives with performance-based
    incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of
    pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a
    three-year period. We currently have three three-year
    performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31,
    2011, 2012 and 2013. Performance measures for each LTIP are
    based on the following components in the last year of the
    three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP earnings per share, 25% on
    non-GAAP net income and 50% on total non-GAAP revenue, as
    defined.

Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the
    participant s salary for the plans. Awards are payable in
    cash or, at our discretion, in our common stock based upon our
    stock price at the payout date. We accrue the long-term
    incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end
    of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of
    our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in
    control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment
    equal to their target award, or an award based on actual
    performance, if higher, through the date of the change in
    control.

Accruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions
    concerning future non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP net
    income and non-GAAP revenues, as defined; the actual results of
    which could be materially different than the assumptions used.
    Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a regular basis and
    revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects
    updated estimates of future payouts. In estimating the accruals,
    management considers actual results to date for the performance
    period, expected results for the remainder of the performance
    period, operating trends, product development, pricing and
    competition.

Valuation
    of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and
    IPR D:  

We have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and
    IPR D primarily through the acquisitions of Pharmion,
    Gloucester and Abraxis. When identifiable intangible assets,
    including in-process research and development, are acquired, we
    determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition
    date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these
    valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the
    models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions
    including but not limited to:

projecting regulatory approvals,

estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from
    completed products and in-process projects and

developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value
    of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for
    by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized,
    but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a
    triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential
    impairment. We test our goodwill annually for impairment each
    November 30. We are organized as a single reporting unit
    and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our
    overall market value, as determined by our traded share price,
    as compared to our book value of net assets.

Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to
    their estimated residual values over their estimated useful
    lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur.
    Intangible assets related to IPR D product rights are
    treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized
    until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities
    in specified markets. At that time, we will determine the useful
    life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of

59

Table of Contents   

IPR D and begin amortization. Impairment testing is also
    performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs
    that could indicate a potential impairment. Our IPR D
    product rights were obtained in the Gloucester and Abraxis
    acquisitions. The Gloucester related product rights will become
    definite-lived intangibles when marketing approval is received
    for
    ISTODAX   

    for treatment of PTCL in the United States and the European
    Union. The Abraxis related product rights will become
    definite-lived intangibles when marketing approval is received
    for
    ABRAXANE   

    for treatment of either NSCLC, pancreatic cancer or melanoma in
    a major market, typically either the United States or the
    European Union, or in a series of other countries, subject to
    certain specified conditions and management judgment.

Valuation
    of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business
    Combination:  

We record contingent consideration resulting from a business
    combination at its fair value on the acquisition date, and for
    each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and
    record increases or decreases in their fair value as an
    adjustment to operating earnings in the consolidated statements
    of operations. Changes to contingent consideration obligations
    can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of
    CVRs, adjustments to discount rates and periods, updates in the
    assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or
    changes in the probability of certain clinical events and
    changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory
    approval. The assumptions related to determining the value of a
    contingent consideration include a significant amount of
    judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a
    material impact on the amount of contingent consideration
    expense recorded in any given period. Our contingent
    consideration liabilities were acquired in the acquisitions of
    Gloucester and Abraxis. The fair value of the Gloucester
    contingent consideration liability is based on the discount
    rates, probabilities and estimated timing of two cash milestone
    payments to the former Gloucester shareholders. The fair value
    of the Abraxis contingent consideration liability is based on
    the quoted market price of the publicly traded CVRs.

ITEM 7A.      

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative
    and qualitative information about our potential exposure to
    market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising
    from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The
    risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse
    changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.

We have established guidelines relative to the diversification
    and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity.
    These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified
    depending on market conditions. Although investments may be
    subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit
    quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of
    credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of
    investment. At December 31, 2010, our market risk sensitive
    instruments consisted of marketable securities available for
    sale, our long-term debt, our note payable and certain foreign
    currency forward contracts.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale:   At
    December 31, 2010, our marketable securities available for
    sale consisted of U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
    securities,
     non-U.S. government, 
    agency and Supranational securities, global corporate debt
    securities and marketable equity securities.
    U.S. government-sponsored agency securities include general
    unsecured obligations either issued directly by or guaranteed by
    U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.
    U.S. government-sponsored agency MBS include mortgage
    backed securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage
    Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the
    Government National Mortgage Association.
     Non-U.S. government, 
    agency and Supranational securities, consist of direct
    obligations of highly rated governments of nations other than
    the United States, obligations of sponsored agencies and other
    entities that are guaranteed or supported by highly rated
    governments of nations other than the United States. Corporate
    debt   global includes obligations issued by
    investment-grade corporations including some issues that have
    been guaranteed by governments and government agencies.

Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair
    value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended
    for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains
    and losses on
     available-for-sale 
    securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a
    separate component of stockholders  equity,

net of tax. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.
    The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other
    than temporary impairment charges, is included in interest and
    investment income, net.

As of December 31, 2010, the principal amounts, fair values
    and related weighted-average interest rates of our investments
    in debt securities classified as marketable securities available
    for sale were as follows:

Long-Term Debt:   On October 7, 2010, we
    issued a total of $1.25 billion principal amount of senior
    notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015, $500.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2020
    and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.7% Senior Notes due 2040. The notes were issued at
    99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the
    discount amortized as additional interest expense over the
    period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of
    approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt
    issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are
    amortized as additional interest expense using the effective
    interest rate method over the period from issuance through
    maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in
    arrears on April 15 and October 15 each year beginning
    April 15, 2011 and the principal on each note is due in
    full at their respective maturity dates. The notes may be
    redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time at a
    redemption price defined in a make-whole clause equaling accrued
    and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of the principal
    amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present
    values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and
    principal. If we experience a change of control accompanied by a
    downgrade of the debt to below investment grade, we will be
    required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price
    equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
    interest. We are subject to covenants which limit our ability to
    pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements and
    limit our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions
    involving our property. At December 31, 2010, the fair
    value of our senior notes outstanding was $1.197 billion.

Note Payable:   In December 2006, we purchased
    an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing
    facility and certain other assets and liabilities from
    Siegfried. At December 31, 2010, the fair value of our note
    payable to Siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note
    of $25.0 million. Assuming other factors are held constant,
    an increase in interest rates generally will result in a
    decrease in the fair value of the note. The note is denominated
    in Swiss francs and its fair value will also be affected by
    changes in the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate. The
    carrying value of the note reflects the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc
    exchange rate and Swiss interest rates.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:   We use
    foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted
    transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce
    exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and
    liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect
    against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows
    resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
    primarily associated with non-functional currency denominated
    revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The foreign
    currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 had settlement dates within
    36 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are
    designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815 and,
    accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or
    losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income
    (loss), or OCI, and reclassified to operations in the same
    periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect
    operations.

61

Table of Contents   

Any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts
    is reported in other income, net. Foreign currency forward
    contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses
    were as follows:

We consider the impact of our own and the counterparties 
    credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the
    ability of each party to execute its obligations under the
    contract. As of December 31, 2010, credit risk did not
    materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward
    contracts.

We recognized an increase in net product sales for certain
    effective cash flow hedge instruments of $47.7 million for
    2010 and a reduction in net product sales of $36.4 million
    for 2009. These settlements were recorded in the same period as
    the related forecasted sales occurred. We recognized a decrease
    in other income, net for the settlement of certain effective
    cash flow hedge instruments of $0.1 million for 2010
    compared to an increase of $6.5 million for 2009. These
    settlements were recorded in the same period as the related
    forecasted expenses occurred. Changes in time value, which we
    excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, were included
    in other income, net.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce
    exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized
    assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These
    foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as
    hedges under ASC 815 and, accordingly, any changes in their
    fair value are recognized in other income, net in the current
    period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency
    forward non-designated hedging contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $848.6 million and
    $483.2 million, respectively.

Although not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 10%
    threshold reflects a reasonably possible near-term change in
    foreign currency rates. Assuming that the December 31, 2010
    exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair
    value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by
    approximately $259.0 million. However, since the contracts
    either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions
    denominated in foreign currencies or relate to assets and
    liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
    entities  functional currencies, any change in the fair
    value of the contract would be either reported in other
    comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same
    periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect
    earnings or remeasured through earnings each period along with
    the underlying asset or liability.

On February 23, 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap
    contract to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure from
    fixed rate to floating rate to more closely align interest
    expense with interest income received on its cash equivalent and
    investment balances. The floating rate is benchmarked to LIBOR.
    The swap is designated as a fair value hedge on the fixed-rate
    debt issue maturing October 2015. Since the specific terms and
    notional amount of the swap match those of the debt being
    hedged, it is assumed to be a highly effective hedge and all
    changes in fair value of the swaps will be recorded on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact recorded in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of this filing, the
    total notional amount of debt hedged with an interest rate swap
    is $125.0 million.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Celgene Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders 
    equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2010. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    consolidated financial statement schedule,
     Schedule II   Valuation and Qualifying
    Accounts.  These consolidated financial statements and
    consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility
    of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company has, as of January 1, 2009, changed
    its method of accounting for business combinations and, as of
    January 1, 2008, changed its method of accounting for the
    measurement of the fair value of financial assets and
    liabilities, each due to the adoption of new accounting
    requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of
    the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
    This report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that
    management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, the internal control over financial
    reporting of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. associated with total net
    assets of approximately $3.2 billion (of which
    approximately $2.6 billion represents goodwill and
    identifiable intangible assets which are included within the
    scope of the assessment) as of December 31, 2010 and total
    revenue of $88.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

1.    

Nature of
    Business and Basis and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies  

Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively
     Celgene  or the  Company ) is a global
    biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery,
    development and commercialization of innovative therapies
    designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. The
    Company is dedicated to innovative research and development
    which is designed to bring new therapies to market and is
    involved in research in several scientific areas that may
    deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, targeting areas
    such as intracellular signaling pathways in cancer and immune
    cells, immunomodulation in cancer and autoimmunity and placental
    cell, including stem and progenitor cell, research.

The Company s primary commercial stage products include
    REVLIMID   ,

    VIDAZA   ,

    THALOMID   

    (inclusive of Thalidomide
    Celgene   

    and Thalidomide
    Pharmion   ),

    ABRAXANE   

    which was obtained in the October 2010 acquisition of Abraxis
    BioScience, Inc., or Abraxis, and
    ISTODAX   ,

    which was obtained in the January 2010 acquisition of Gloucester
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Gloucester (See Note 2).
    Additional sources of revenue include sales of
    FOCALIN   

    exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, a licensing
    agreement with Novartis, which entitles the Company to royalties
    on FOCALIN
    XR   

    and the entire
    RITALIN   

    family of drugs, residual payments from GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK,
    based upon GSK s
    ALKERAN   

    revenues through the end of March 2011, sale of services through
    the Company s Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary and other
    miscellaneous licensing agreements.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries, including certain
    former Abraxis entities determined to be non-core to the Company
    and reported as assets held for sale and liabilities of disposal
    group on the consolidated balance sheet. Investments in limited
    partnerships and interests where the Company has an equity
    interest of 50% or less and does not otherwise have a
    controlling financial interest are accounted for by either the
    equity or cost method. The Company records net income (loss)
    attributable to non-controlling interest in its Consolidated
    Statements of Operations equal to the percentage of ownership
    interest retained in the respective operations by the
    non-controlling parties.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. The Company is subject to certain
    risks and uncertainties related to product development,
    regulatory approval, market acceptance, scope of patent and
    proprietary rights, competition, technological change and
    product liability.

Financial Instruments:   Certain financial
    instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (e.g.,
    cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other
    assets, accounts payable and certain other liabilities) are
    recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their
    short-term nature. The fair values of financial instruments
    other than marketable securities are determined through a
    combination of management estimates and information obtained
    from third parties using the latest market data. The fair value
    of
     available-for-sale 
    marketable securities is determined utilizing the valuation
    techniques appropriate to the type of security (See Note 5).

Derivative Instruments and Hedges:   All
    derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at
    their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
    instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or
    other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a
    derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging
    transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging transaction. For
    a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout
    the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature and
    relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item.
    The Company assesses, both at inception and on an on-going
    basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash
    flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the
    changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company assesses
    hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and records the gain
    or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative
    instruments, if any, to current earnings. If the Company
    determines that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable
    of occurring, it discontinues hedge accounting and any related
    unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
    recognized in current earnings. The Company uses derivative
    instruments, including those not designated as part of a hedging
    transaction, to manage its exposure to

69

    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. The use of
    these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these
    risks with the intent to reduce the Company s risk or cost.
    The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative
    trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available
    for Sale:   The Company invests its excess cash
    primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
    securities,
     non-U.S. government, 
    agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt
    securities. All liquid investments with maturities of three
    months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash
    equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than
    three months from date of purchase are classified as marketable
    securities available for sale. The Company determines the
    appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt
    and equity securities at the time of purchase. Marketable
    securities available for sale are carried at fair value, held
    for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in
    meeting the Company s ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized
    gains and losses on
     available-for-sale 
    securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a
    separate component of stockholders  equity, net of tax. The
    cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums
    and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along
    with realized gains and losses and other than temporary
    impairment charges, is included in interest and investment
    income, net.

A decline in the market value of any
     available-for-sale 
    security below its carrying value that is determined to be
     other-than-temporary 
    would result in a charge to earnings and decrease in the
    security s carrying value down to its newly established
    fair value. Factors evaluated to determine if an investment is
     other-than-temporarily 
    impaired include significant deterioration in earnings
    performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects
    of the issuer; adverse changes in the general market condition
    in which the issuer operates; the Company s intent to hold
    to maturity and an evaluation as to whether it is more likely
    than not that the Company will not have to sell before recovery
    of its cost basis; and issues that raise concerns about the
    issuer s ability to continue as a going concern.

Concentration of Credit Risk:   Cash, cash
    equivalents and marketable securities are financial instruments
    that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit
    risk. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in money
    market funds, U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed fixed rate
    securities and FDIC guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt,
     non-U.S. government 
    issued securities and
     non-U.S. government 
    guaranteed securities (See Note 7). The Company may also
    invest in unrated or below investment grade securities, such as
    equity in private companies. The Company has established
    guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to
    maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed
    periodically and may be modified to take advantage of trends in
    yields and interest rates.

The Company sells its products in the United States primarily
    through wholesale distributors and specialty contracted
    pharmacies. Therefore, wholesale distributors and large pharmacy
    chains account for a large portion of the Company s
    U.S. trade receivables and net product revenues (See
    Note 20). International sales are primarily made directly
    to hospitals, clinics and retail chains, many of which in Europe
    are government owned and have extended their payment terms in
    recent years given the economic pressure these countries are
    facing. The Company continuously monitors the creditworthiness
    of its customers, including these governments, and has internal
    policies regarding customer credit limits. The Company also
    continues to monitor economic conditions, including the
    volatility associated with international sovereign economies,
    associated impacts on the financial markets and its business and
    the sovereign debt crisis in certain European countries. The
    Company believes the credit and economic conditions within
    Spain, Italy and Portugal, among other members of the European
    Union, have deteriorated during 2010. Total net receivables in
    these three countries amounted to $231.6 million at
    December 31, 2010. These conditions, as well as inherent
    variability of timing of cash receipts, have resulted in, and
    may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of
    time that it takes to collect on the accounts receivable
    outstanding in these countries. The Company estimates an
    allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit
    worthiness of its customers, historical payment patterns, aging
    of receivable balances and general economic conditions.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

Inventory:   Inventories are recorded at the
    lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a
     first-in, 
    first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews the
    composition of inventory in order to identify obsolete,
    slow-moving or otherwise non-saleable items. If non-saleable
    items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the
    inventory, the Company will record a write-down to net
    realizable value in the period that the decline in value is
    first recognized. Included in inventory are raw materials used
    in the production of preclinical and clinical products, which
    are charged to research and development expense when consumed.

Assets Held for Sale:   Assets to be disposed of
    are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and
    reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value
    less costs to sell, and are not depreciated. The assets and
    related liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for
    sale are presented separately in the current asset and current
    liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet.

Property, Plant and Equipment:   Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation of plant and equipment is recorded using the
    straight-line method. Building improvements are depreciated over
    the remaining useful life of the building. Leasehold
    improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the economic
    useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease,
    including anticipated renewal options. The estimated useful
    lives of capitalized assets are as follows:

Buildings

40 years

Building and operating equipment

15 years

Manufacturing machinery and equipment

10 years

Other machinery and equipment

5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Computer equipment and software

3-7 years

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred,
    while expenditures for improvements which extend the life of an
    asset are capitalized.

Capitalized Software Costs:   The Company
    capitalizes software costs incurred in connection with
    developing or obtaining software. Capitalized software costs are
    included in property, plant and equipment, net and are amortized
    over their estimated useful life of three to seven years from
    the date the systems are ready for their intended use.

Investment in Affiliated Companies:   The
    Company applies the equity method of accounting to its
    investments in common stock of affiliated companies and certain
    investment funds, which primarily invest in companies conducting
    business in life sciences such as biotechnology,
    pharmaceuticals, medical technology, medical devices,
    diagnostics and health and wellness. Equity method investments
    obtained through the acquisition of former Abraxis have been
    determined to be non-core activities and are classified as
    assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet.

Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible
    impairment. If an investment s fair value is determined to
    be less than its net carrying value and the decline is
    determined to be
     other-than-temporary, 
    the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an
    evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and
    circumstances. Factors considered in determining whether an
     other-than-temporary 
    decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit
    price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or
    future rounds of financing by the investee; length of time that
    the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition
    and business prospects of the investee; the Company s
    intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient
    period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the
    investment; issues that raise concerns about the investee s
    ability to continue as a going concern; any other information
    that the Company may be aware of related to the investment.

Other Intangible Assets:   Intangible assets
    with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated
    residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed
    for impairment if certain events occur as described in
     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  below. Intangible
    assets which are not amortized include acquired in-process

research and development, or IPR D, and acquired intangible
    assets held for sale. Amortization is initiated for IPR D
    intangible assets when their useful lives have been determined.
    IPR D intangible assets which are determined to have had a
    drop in their fair value, are adjusted downward through the
    earnings statement. These are tested at least annually or when a
    triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential
    impairment.

Goodwill:   Goodwill represents the excess of
    purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a
    business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of
    accounting and is not amortized, but subject to impairment
    testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that
    could indicate a potential impairment. The Company tests its
    goodwill annually for impairment each November 30.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:   Long-lived
    assets, such as property, plant and equipment are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to
    the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
    generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of
    the assets exceed their estimated future undiscounted net cash
    flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which
    the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the
    assets.

Foreign Currency Translation:   Operations in
     non-U.S. entities 
    are recorded in the functional currency of each entity. For
    financial reporting purposes, the functional currency of an
    entity is determined by a review of the source of an
    entity s most predominant cash flows. Effective
    January 1, 2010, the Company changed the functional
    currency of Celgene International Sarl from the Euro to the
    U.S. Dollar. Significant changes in economic facts and
    circumstances supported this change in functional currency and
    the change was applied on a prospective basis. The results of
    operations for
     non-U.S. dollar 
    functional currency entities are translated from functional
    currencies into U.S. dollars using the average currency
    rate during each month, which approximates the results that
    would be obtained using actual currency rates on the dates of
    individual transactions. Assets and liabilities are translated
    using currency rates at the end of the period. Adjustments
    resulting from translating the financial statements of the
    Company s foreign entities into the U.S. dollar are
    excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded
    as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction
    gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had net
    foreign exchange losses of $9.8 million in 2010 and gains
    of $54.5 million and $4.7 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Research and Development Costs:   Research and
    development costs are expensed as incurred. These include all
    internal and external costs related to services contracted by
    the Company. Upfront and milestone payments made to third
    parties in connection with research and development
    collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of
    regulatory approval. Milestone payments made to third parties
    subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized
    over the remaining useful life of the related product.

Income Taxes:   The Company utilizes the asset
    and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
    method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
    on the difference between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences
    are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when
    it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes
    the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or
    expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax
    position is more likely than not to be sustained.

Revenue Recognition:   Revenue from the sale of
    products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the
    product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for
    discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and
    distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry
    are provided for in the same period the related sales are
    recorded.

Sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to
    customers.

Government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due
    to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties
    under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate
    accruals are generally based on historical payment data and
    estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to
    the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for
    Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Company utilized historical
    patient data to estimate the incremental costs related to the
    Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. In addition, certain
    international markets have government-sponsored programs that
    require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and,
    accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on
    estimated eligible sales.

Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale
    customers, GPOs and end-user customers, consistent with
    pharmaceutical industry practices. The Company provides a
    provision for rebates at the time of sale based on the
    contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Upon receipt
    of chargeback, due to the availability of product and customer
    specific information on these programs, the Company then
    establishes a specific provision for fees or rebates based on
    the specific terms of each agreement.

The Company bases its sales returns allowance on estimated
    on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer
    demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns
    history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots
    where product is still being returned or inventory
    centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by
    major pharmacy chains. If the historical data used by the
    Company to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect
    future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in
    the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in
    that period could be materially affected. Under this
    methodology, the Company tracks actual returns by individual
    production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer
    eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine
    historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is,
    lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and
    compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from
    the historical trend rates are considered in determining the
    current sales return allowance.

Chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between
    product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower
    government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered
    under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee
    accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the
    wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health
    care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military
    Health System that provides civilian health benefits for
    military personnel, military retirees and their dependents.
    TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated Department of
    Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.

The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for free
    goods and volume-based discounts at the time of the initial
    sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such free goods
    and volume-based discounts are based on the sales terms,
    historical experience and trend analysis. The cost of free goods
    is included in Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of
    acquired intangible assets).

The Company recognizes revenue from royalties based on
    licensees  sales of its products or products using its
    technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance
    with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be
    reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    If royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectibility of
    a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, royalties are
    recognized as revenue when the cash is received.

Share-Based Compensation:   The cost of
    share-based compensation is recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations based on the fair value of all awards
    granted, using the Black-Scholes method of valuation. The fair
    value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is
    recognized over the service period required to obtain full
    vesting. Compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate
    of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into
    consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual
    experience.

Earnings Per Share:   Basic earnings per share
    is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
    earnings per share is computed by dividing net income adjusted
    to add back the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the
    period associated with any convertible debt issuance that may be
    dilutive by the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding

during the period increased to include all additional common
    shares that would have been outstanding as if the outstanding
    convertible debt was converted into shares of common stock and
    assuming potentially dilutive common shares, resulting from
    option exercises, restricted stock units, warrants and other
    incentives had been issued and any proceeds thereof used to
    repurchase common stock at the average market price during the
    period. The assumed proceeds used to repurchase common stock is
    the sum of the amount to be paid to the Company upon exercise of
    options, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future
    services and not yet recognized and, if applicable, the amount
    of excess income tax benefit that would be credited to paid-in
    capital upon exercise. As of their maturity date, June 1,
    2008, substantially all of the Company s convertible notes
    were converted into shares of common stock.

Comprehensive Income:   The components of
    comprehensive income (loss) consist of net income (loss),
    changes in pension liability, changes in net unrealized gains
    (losses) on marketable securities classified as
     available-for-sale, 
    net unrealized gains (losses) related to cash flow hedges and
    changes in foreign currency translation adjustments, which
    includes changes in a subsidiary s functional currency and
    net asset transfers of common control subsidiaries.

A summary of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of tax, is summarized as follows:

New Accounting Pronouncements:   In October
    2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
    Accounting Standard Update, or ASU,
     No. 2009-13, 
     Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements,  or ASU
     2009-13, 
    which amends existing revenue recognition accounting
    pronouncements that are currently within the scope of FASB
    Accounting Standards
    Codification  tm  ,

    or ASC, 605. This guidance eliminates the requirement to
    establish the fair value of undelivered products and services
    and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon
    management s estimate of the selling price for an
    undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the
    fair value of that undelivered item. ASU
     2009-13  is
    effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact, if any, that the adoption of this amendment will have on
    its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-06, 
     Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements, 
    or ASU
     2010-06, 
    which amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for
    disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2
    and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and
    settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU
     2010-06  also
    clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of
    disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value. Further, ASU
     2010-06 
    amends guidance on employers  disclosures about
    post-retirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715 to
    require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets
    instead of by major categories of assets. ASU
     2010-06  was
    effective for the first reporting period (including interim
    periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the
    requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases,
    sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will
    be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
    adoption is permitted. The section of the amendment pertaining
    to transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 was effective
    for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of
    this section of the amendment did not have any impact on

74

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

the Company s consolidated financial statements. The
    section of the amendment pertaining to Level 3 measurements
    will be effective for the Company beginning January 1,
    2011. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any,
    that the adoption of this amendment will have on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-17, 
     Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition,  or ASU
     2010-17,  to
    (1) limit the scope of this ASU to research or development
    arrangements and (2) require that guidance in this ASU be
    met for an entity to apply the milestone method (record the
    milestone payment in its entirety in the period received).
    However, the FASB clarified that, even if the requirements in
    ASU  2010-17 
    are met, entities would not be precluded from making an
    accounting policy election to apply another appropriate
    accounting policy that results in the deferral of some portion
    of the arrangement consideration. The guidance in ASU
     2010-17  will
    apply to milestones in both single-deliverable and
    multiple-deliverable arrangements involving research or
    development transactions. ASU
     2010-17  will
    be effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those
    fiscal years) beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early
    application is permitted. Entities can apply this guidance
    prospectively to milestones achieved after adoption. However,
    retrospective application to all prior periods is also
    permitted. The adoption of this accounting standard will not
    have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-27, 
     Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Pharmaceutical
    Manufacturers,  or ASU
     2010-27.  ASU
     2010-27 
    provides guidance concerning the recognition and classification
    of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug
    manufactures and importers on branded prescription drugs which
    was mandated under the U.S. Health Care Reform Act enacted
    in the United States in March 2010. Under this new accounting
    standard, the annual fee would be presented as a component of
    operating expenses and recognized over the calendar year. Such
    fees are payable using a straight-line method of allocation
    unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar
    year. This ASU is effective for calendar years beginning on or
    after December 31, 2010. As this standard relates only to
    classification, the adoption of this accounting standard will
    not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU
     No. 2010-29, 
     Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information, 
    or ASU
     2010-29.  ASU
     2010-29 
    clarifies disclosure requirements to require public entities
    that enter into business combinations that are material on an
    individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information
    for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting
    period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined
    entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the
    beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
    ASU  2010-29 
    is effective for material business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011 and early
    adoption is permitted. The Company has chosen early adoption of
    ASU  2010-29 
    and the pro forma information related to the acquisitions of
    Abraxis and Gloucester complies with the provisions of this
    standard (See Note 2).

Acquisitions  

Abraxis
    BioScience, Inc.   

On October 15, 2010, or the Acquisition Date, the Company
    acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis
    BioScience, Inc., or Abraxis. The transaction, referred to as
    the Merger, resulted in Abraxis becoming a wholly owned
    subsidiary of the Company. The results of operations for Abraxis
    are included in the Company s consolidated financial
    statements from the date of acquisition and the assets and
    liabilities of Abraxis have been recorded at their respective
    fair values on the acquisition date and consolidated with those
    of the Company.

Prior to the Merger, Abraxis was a fully integrated global
    biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery, development
    and delivery of next-generation therapeutics and core
    technologies that offer patients treatments for cancer and other
    critical illnesses. Abraxis  portfolio includes an oncology
    compound,
    ABRAXANE   ,

    which is based on Abraxis  proprietary tumor-targeting
    platform known as
    nab   

    technology.
    ABRAXANE   ,

    the first FDA approved product to use the
    nab   

    technology, was launched in 2005 for the treatment of metastatic
    breast cancer.

Abraxis has continued to expand the
    nab   

    technology through a clinical program and a product pipeline
    containing a number of
    nab   

    technology products in development. The acquisition of Abraxis
    accelerates the Company s strategy to become a global
    leader in oncology by adding the
    nab   

    technology and
    ABRAXANE   

    to the technology and product portfolios of the Company.

Each share of Abraxis common stock outstanding, other than
    treasury shares of Abraxis, was cancelled and the holder
    received (i) $58.00 in cash, (ii) 0.2617 of a share of
    the Company s common stock and (iii) one contingent
    value right, or CVR, issued by the Company. Stock options
    belonging to employees were cancelled in exchange for one CVR
    plus a cash payment amounting to the sum of $58.00 in cash plus
    the equivalent value of one share of Celgene common stock less
    the exercise price of each option. As discussed further in the
    section entitled  Contingent Value Rights  below, a
    holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a pro rata portion of
    cash payments that the Company is obligated to pay to all
    holders of CVRs, which is determined by achievement of certain
    net sales and U.S. regulatory approval milestones.
    Potential cash payments to CVR holders ranges from no payment if
    no regulatory milestones are met, to a maximum of
    $650 million in milestone payments plus payments based on
    annual net sales levels achieved if all milestones are met at
    the earliest target dates and sales exceed threshold amounts. A
    total of approximately $2.363 billion in cash was paid and
    10,660,196 shares of the Company s common stock and
    43,273,855 CVRs were issued as consideration for the Merger.

The table below lists the fair value of consideration
    transferred in the Merger:

The Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method
    of accounting which requires that most assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the
    acquisition date and requires the fair value of acquired
    in-process research and development to be classified as
    indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or
    abandonment of the associated research and development efforts.
    A preliminary purchase price allocation has been made and the
    recorded amounts are subject to change. The following items are
    subject to change:

Amounts for intangible assets and associated deferred tax
    liabilities pending finalization of valuation efforts.

Amounts for property plant and equipment, pending the
    confirmation of physical existence and condition of certain
    property, plant and equipment.

Amounts for assumed contingent liabilities pending the
    finalization of our examination and valuation of filed cases.

Amounts for income tax assets, receivables and liabilities,
    pending the filing of Abraxis pre-acquisition tax returns.

The amounts recognized will be finalized as the information
    necessary to complete the analyses is obtained, but no later
    than one year from the acquisition date. Material adjustments,
    if any, could require retrospective application if they impact
    amortization amounts.

The preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in the
    following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their
    respective preliminary fair values summarized below:

(1)  

Includes cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other
    current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities. 

(2)  

Includes assets held for sale of $345.6 million less
    liabilities of disposal group of $39.3 million. 

(3)  

Includes current deferred income tax asset of
    $110.7 million and non-current deferred tax liability of
    $981.1 million. 

The purchase of Abraxis included a number of assets that are not
    associated with the
    nab   

    technology or
    ABRAXANE   .

    These assets, or non-core assets, include a number of
    subsidiaries, tangible assets, equity investments, joint venture
    partnerships and assets that support research and sales of
    products not related to the
    nab   

    technology. The Company has committed to a plan to divest these
    non-core assets and they are classified as assets held for sale
    on the consolidated balance sheet and the associated liabilities
    have been classified as liabilities of disposal group.

The fair values of current assets and current liabilities were
    determined to approximate their book values while the fair value
    of inventory was determined to be greater than book value and
    the fair value of property plant and equipment not attributable
    to non-core assets was determined to be greater than book value.
    The fair value of current assets acquired includes trade
    receivables of $58.4 million, of which $13.0 million
    is attributable to non-core subsidiaries and included in assets
    held for sale. The gross amount due is $61.1 million, of
    which $2.7 million is expected to be uncollectible.

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

The amounts recorded for the major components of acquired
    identifiable intangible assets are as follows:

The fair value of the developed product rights asset was based
    on expected cash flows from developed product right sales of
    ABRAXANE   ,

    a nanoparticle, albumin-bound paclitaxel that was approved by
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in January
    2005, based on a 505(b)(2) submission, for the treatment of
    metastatic breast cancer and, as of December 2010, was approved
    for marketing in 42 countries. The fair value of the developed
    product rights asset was derived using an income approach and
    will be amortized over its expected useful life of 17 years.

Other finite-lived intangible assets include the fair value of
    licensing contract rights, non-compete agreements and future
    compassionate use sales.

The IPR D product right asset was assigned a fair value of
    $1.290 billion based on probability-weighted net cash flows
    associated with future
    ABRAXANE   

    approval for indications to treat non-small cell lung cancer, or
    NSCLC, pancreatic cancer and melanoma. The fair value
    calculation used a risk-adjusted discount rate of 19% and the
    following anticipated regulatory approval dates:

Acquired IPR D will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived
    intangible asset until regulatory approval in specified markets
    or discontinuation.

The fair value of assumed contingent liabilities were included
    based on management s assessment of probable outcomes of
    litigation involving Abraxis initiated prior to the Merger. The
    fair value assigned to assumed contingent liabilities amounts to
    the present value of estimated future cash flows related to such
    litigation.

The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts
    assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition.
    The goodwill recorded as part of the Merger is largely
    attributable to synergies expected to result from combining the
    operations of Abraxis and the Company and intangible assets that
    do not qualify for separate recognition. The Company does not
    expect any portion of this goodwill to be deductible for tax
    purposes. The goodwill attributable to the Merger has been
    recorded as a noncurrent asset in its Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and is not amortized, but is subject to review for
    impairment annually.

Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests have been
    recorded to reflect the fair value of the portion of assets and
    liabilities assumed at the acquisition date that are
    attributable to noncontrolling interest owners of certain
    acquired consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned.

Contingent
    Value Rights   

In connection with the Merger on October 15, 2010, CVRs
    were issued under a CVR agreement entered into by Celgene and
    American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC, the
    trustee. A copy of the CVR agreement was filed on
     Form 8-A 
    with the SEC on October 15, 2010. The CVRs are registered
    for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol
     CELGZ.  The fair value of the CVRs and the liability
    of the Company related to payments under the CVR agreement is
    subject to fluctuation based on trading prices for the publicly
    traded CVRs. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company has
    measured the contingent consideration represented by the CVRs at
    fair value with changes in fair value recognized in operating
    earnings. At December 31, 2010, the balance of the CVR
    related liability was $212.0 million and is included in
    other non-current liabilities.

Each holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a  pro rata
     portion, based on the number of CVRs then outstanding, of
    each of the following contingent cash payments:

Milestone Payment #1.   $250 million
    upon FDA approval of
    ABRAXANE   

    for use in the treatment of NSCLC, which approval permits the
    Company to market
    ABRAXANE   

    under a label that includes a progression free survival claim,
    but only if the foregoing milestone is achieved no later than
    the fifth anniversary of the Merger.

Milestone Payment #2.   $400 million
    (if achieved no later than April 1, 2013) or
    $300 million (if achieved after April 1, 2013 and
    before the fifth anniversary of the Merger) upon FDA approval of
    ABRAXANE   

    for use in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, which approval
    permits the Company to market
    ABRAXANE   

    under a label that includes an overall survival claim.

Net Sales Payments.   For each full one-year
    period ending December 31st during the term of the CVR
    agreement, which we refer to as a net sales measuring period
    (with the first net sales measuring period beginning
    January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2011):

2.5% of the net sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed $1 billion
    but are less than or equal to $2 billion for such period,
    plus

an additional amount equal to 5% of the net sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed $2 billion
    but are less than or equal to $3 billion for such period,
    plus

an additional amount equal to 10% of the net sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed $3 billion
    for such period.

No payments will be due under the CVR agreement with respect to
    net sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    and the Abraxis pipeline products achieved after
    December 31, 2025, which we refer to as the net sales
    payment termination date, unless net sales for the net sales
    measuring period ending on December 31, 2025 are equal to
    or greater than $1 billion, in which case the net sales
    payment termination date will be extended until the last day of
    the net sales measuring period subsequent to December 31,
    2025 during which net sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    and the Abraxis pipeline products are less than $1 billion
    or, if earlier, December 31, 2030.

The Company may, at any time on and after the date that 50% of
    the CVRs issued pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement
    either are no longer outstanding,
     and/or 
    repurchased, acquired, redeemed or retired by the Company,
    redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding CVRs at a
    cash redemption price equal to the average price per CVR paid
    for all CVRs by the Company in prior transactions.

The CVRs are unsecured obligations of the Company, subordinated
    to an unlimited amount of the Company s senior obligations.

Gloucester
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   

On January 15, 2010, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding common stock and stock options of Gloucester. The
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Gloucester were
    recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair
    values, and consolidated with those of the Company. The reported
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations of
    the Company after completion of the acquisition reflect these
    fair values. Gloucester s results of operations are
    included in the Company s consolidated financial statements
    from the date of acquisition. Gloucester contributed net
    revenues of $15.8 million and losses of $50.3 million
    for the period from the acquisition date through
    December 31, 2010.

The Company paid $338.9 million in cash before milestone
    payments and may make additional future payments of
    $300.0 million in contingent regulatory milestone payments.
    Prior to the acquisition, Gloucester was a privately held
    biopharmaceutical company that acquired clinical-stage oncology
    drug candidates with the goal of advancing them through
    regulatory approval and commercialization. The Company acquired
    Gloucester to enhance its portfolio of therapies for patients
    with life-threatening illnesses worldwide.

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts
    being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    at the acquisition date based upon their respective fair values
    summarized below:

Asset categories acquired in the Gloucester acquisition included
    working capital, inventory, fixed assets, developed product
    right assets and IPR D product right assets. Fair values of
    working capital and fixed assets were determined to approximate
    book values while the fair value of inventory was determined to
    be greater than book value.

The fair value of developed product right assets was based on
    expected cash flows from developed product right sales of
    ISTODAX   

    (romidepsin), a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor,
    which was approved for marketing in the United States in
    November 2009 by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell
    lymphoma, or CTCL, in patients who have received at least one
    prior systemic therapy. Prior to the acquisition, Gloucester was
    also conducting a registration trial in peripheral T-cell
    lymphoma, or PTCL, in the United States, which resulted in a
    supplemental New Drug Application filing in December 2010 for
    this indication. Fair values were derived using
    probability-weighted cash flows. The U.S. CTCL developed
    product right asset is being amortized over its economic useful
    life of ten years. The compassionate use right asset is being
    amortized evenly over the asset s economic useful life of
    1.5 years.

The fair value of IPR D product right assets was based on
    expected cash flows from sales of
    ISTODAX   

    (romidepsin) for the treatment of PTCL, which had not yet
    achieved regulatory approval for marketing and has no future
    alternative use. The $349.0 million estimated fair value of
    IPR D product rights was derived using

80

Table of Contents   

CELGENE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

probability-weighted cash flows. The fair value was based on
    expected cash flows from the treatment of PTCL in the United
    States and PTCL in the European Union, or E.U., based on key
    assumptions such as estimates of sales and operating profits
    related to the programs considering their stages of development;
    the time and resources needed to complete the regulatory
    approval process for the products and the life of the potential
    commercialized products and associated risks, including the
    inherent difficulties and uncertainties in obtaining regulatory
    approvals.

The U.S. PTCL IPR D product right asset was assigned a
    value of $287.0 million based on related future net cash
    flows estimated using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 14.5% and
    an anticipated regulatory approval date in mid-2011 with market
    exclusivity rights expected to continue through 2017. The E.U.
    PTCL IPR D product right asset was assigned a value of
    $62.0 million based on future net cash flows using a
    risk-adjusted discount rate of 14.5% and an anticipated
    regulatory approval date in mid-2015 with market exclusivity
    rights expected to continue through 2021.

The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts
    assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition.
    The Company does not expect any portion of this goodwill to be
    deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill attributable to the
    Company s acquisition of Gloucester has been recorded as a
    noncurrent asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not
    amortized, but is subject to review for impairment annually.

As part of the Company s consideration for the Gloucester
    acquisition, it is contractually obligated to pay certain
    consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. The
    Company updates its assumptions each reporting period based on
    new developments and records such amounts at fair value until
    such consideration is satisfied.

The Gloucester acquisition included two contingent
    considerations which would obligate the Company to make a
    $180.0 million cash milestone payment to the former
    Gloucester shareholders upon the marketing approval for the
    U.S. PTCL IPR D product right asset and a
    $120.0 million cash milestone payment upon the marketing
    approval for the E.U. PTCL IPR D product right asset.

The initial fair value of contingent considerations was
    $230.2 million, consisting of $156.7 million based on
    the $180.0 million milestone payment upon U.S. PTCL
    approval and $73.5 million based on the $120.0 million
    milestone payment upon E.U. PTCL approval. The Company
    determined the fair value of these obligations to pay additional
    milestone payments upon approvals based on a
    probability-weighted income approach. This fair value
    measurement is based on significant input not observable in the
    market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement within the
    fair value hierarchy. The resulting probability-weighted cash
    flows were discounted using a Baa rated debt yield of
    6.15 percent, which the Company believes is appropriate and
    representative of a market participant assumption. The range of
    estimated milestone payments is from no payment if both product
    indications fail to gain market approval to $300.0 million
    if both product indications gain market approval. The Company
    classified the contingent considerations as liabilities, which
    were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair
    value is based on the future milestone payments adjusted for the
    probability of each payment and the time until each payment is
    expected to be made.

Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company has measured the
    contingent consideration arrangement at fair value each period
    with changes in fair value recognized in operating earnings.
    Changes pertaining to facts and circumstances that existed as of
    the acquisition date will be recognized as adjustments to
    goodwill. Changes in fair values reflect new information about
    the IPR D assets and the passage of time. In the absence of
    new information, changes in fair value will only reflect the
    passage of time as development work towards the achievement of
    the milestones progresses and will be accrued based on an
    accretion schedule. At December 31, 2010, the balance of
    the contingent consideration was $252.9 million, of which
    $171.9 million is included in other current liabilities and
    $81.0 million included in other non-current liabilities.

Pharmion
    Corporation   

On March 7, 2008, Celgene acquired all of the outstanding
    common stock and stock options of Pharmion Corporation, or
    Pharmion, in a transaction accounted for under the purchase
    method of accounting for business combinations. Celgene paid a
    combination of $920.8 million in cash and approximately
    30.8 million shares of Celgene common stock valued at
    $1.749 billion to Pharmion shareholders. The operating
    results of Pharmion are included in the Company s
    consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

The 2008 acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method
    of accounting for business combinations and the allocation of
    the purchase price paid resulted in goodwill of
    $556.4 million, developed product rights of
    $509.7 million and an in-process research and development
    charge of $1.740 billion.

Pro
    Forma Information   

The following table presents unaudited pro forma information as
    if the acquisitions of Abraxis and Gloucester had occurred on
    January 1, 2009.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated results were prepared using
    the acquisition method of accounting and are based on the
    historical financial information of the Company, Abraxis and
    Gloucester. The historical financial information has been
    adjusted to give effect to the pro forma events that are:
    (i) directly attributable to the respective acquisition,
    (ii) factually supportable and (iii) expected to have
    a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro
    forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of
    what the Company s consolidated results of operations
    actually would have been had we completed the acquisitions on
    January 1, 2009. In addition, the unaudited pro forma
    consolidated results do not purport to project the future
    results of operations of the combined company nor do they
    reflect the expected realization of any cost savings associated
    with the acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated
    results reflect primarily the following pro forma pre-tax
    adjustments:

Elimination of Abraxis  historical intangible asset
    amortization expense of approximately $32.0 million in the
    pre-acquisition period in 2010 and $39.8 million in 2009.

Additional amortization expense of approximately
    $65.8 million in 2010 and $114.8 million in 2009
    related to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets
    acquired in the acquisitions of Abraxis and Gloucester.

Adjustment of expense related to the accretion of contingent
    consideration issued in the acquisition of Gloucester amounting
    to a $6.4 million reduction of expense in 2010 and
    additional expense of $23.7 million in 2009. No
    corresponding adjustment was made for the change in value of
    contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of
    Abraxis as changes in the fair value of the Abraxis contingent
    consideration is dependant on the market price of the publicly
    traded CVRs.

A net reduction of depreciation expense of approximately
    $8.1 million in 2010 and $8.6 million in 2009
    reflecting the cessation of depreciation expense on assets
    acquired in the Abraxis acquisition that are classified as held
    for sale, partially offset by an increase in depreciation
    related to the fair value adjustment of property, plant and
    equipment acquired.

A reduction of interest income of approximately
    $21.9 million in 2010 and $66.8 million in 2009
    associated with cash and marketable securities that were used to
    partially fund the acquisition of Abraxis.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

Elimination of $34.7 million incurred in 2010 related to
    the fair value adjustments to acquisition-date inventory from
    the acquisition of Abraxis that has been sold, which is
    considered nonrecurring. There is no long-term continuing impact
    of the fair value adjustments to acquisition-date inventory,
    and, as such, the impact of those adjustments is not reflected
    in the unaudited pro forma operating results for 2010 and 2009.

Elimination of $222.5 million of costs incurred in 2010,
    which are directly attributable to the acquisition of Abraxis,
    and which do not have a continuing impact on the combined
    company s operating results. Included in these costs are
    restructuring, advisory, legal and regulatory costs incurred by
    both the Company and Abraxis.

Adjusted basic and diluted shares of Celgene common stock to
    reflect the addition of 10,660 shares of common stock
    issued to stockholders of Abraxis. The common stock was assumed
    to have been issued on January 1, 2009.

In addition, an income tax adjustment was included in the
    calculation of the pro forma consolidated results using the
    Company s U.S. statutory tax rate, estimated at 40%,
    applied to the pro forma adjustments impacting taxable income.

3.    

Restructuring  

In connection with the October 15, 2010 acquisition of
    Abraxis, the Company recorded a restructuring liability in the
    amount of $16.1 million related to planned employee
    termination costs. Employee termination costs are generally
    recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include
    accrued severance benefits and health insurance continuation,
    many of which may be paid out during periods after termination.
     The
    following table summarizes restructuring liability activity
    related to the Abraxis acquisition during the year ended
    December 31, 2010:

The Company does not expect to incur additional restructuring
    expense in 2011 and additional cash payments related to the
    restructuring activity are estimated to amount to
    $10.4 million in 2011 and $4.5 million in 2012.
    Acquisition-related charges and restructuring, net on the
    accompanying 2010 Consolidated Statement of Operations includes
    the above costs, the changes in the fair value of contingent
    consideration and other miscellaneous legal, accounting and
    investment banking costs.

The March 7, 2008 acquisition cost of Pharmion included
    $58.6 million in restructuring liabilities primarily
    related to the planned exit of certain business activities,
    involuntary terminations and the relocation of certain Pharmion
    employees. Payments totaling $0.3 million,
    $15.4 million and $31.0 million were made in 2010,
    2009 and 2008 respectively. There was no remaining liability for
    the Pharmion restructuring at December 31, 2010.

Financial
    Instruments and Fair Value Measurement  

The table below presents information about assets and
    liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
    as of December 31, 2010 and the valuation techniques the
    Company utilized to determine such fair value. Fair values
    determined based on Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices
    (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities. The Company s Level 1 assets consist of
    marketable equity securities. Fair values determined based on
    Level 2 inputs utilize observable quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets and observable quoted
    prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not
    very active. The Company s Level 2 assets consist
    primarily of U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
    securities,
     non-U.S. government, 
    agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt
    securities. Fair values determined based on Level 3 inputs
    utilize unobservable inputs and include valuations of assets or
    liabilities for which there is little, if any, market activity.
    The Company s Level 3 assets consist of warrants for
    the purchase of equity securities in non-publicly traded
    companies in which the Company has invested and which is party
    to a collaboration and option agreement with the Company, in
    addition to an investment in common shares of a small
    biopharmaceutical company. The Company s Level 1
    liability relates to

publicly traded CVRs. The Level 2 liability relates to
    forward currency contracts and the Level 3 liability
    consists of contingent consideration related to undeveloped
    product rights resulting from the Gloucester acquisition.

There were no security transfers between Levels I
    and II in 2010. The following tables represent a

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities  

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:   The
    Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
    specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign
    currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign currency
    fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to
    protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash
    flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
    primarily associated with non-functional currency denominated
    revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The foreign
    currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 had settlement
    dates within 36 months. These foreign currency forward
    contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and to the extent
    effective, any unrealized gains or losses on them are reported
    in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, and reclassified
    to operations in the same periods during which the underlying
    hedged transactions affect operations. Any ineffectiveness on
    these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other
    income, net. Foreign currency forward contracts entered into to
    hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at
    December 31, 2010:

The Company considers the impact of its own and the
    counterparties  credit risk on the fair value of the
    contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its
    obligations under the contract on an ongoing basis. As of
    December 31, 2010, credit risk did not materially change
    the fair value of the Company s foreign currency forward
    contracts.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts
    to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain
    recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
    currencies. These foreign currency forward contracts have not
    been designated as hedges and, accordingly, any changes in their
    fair value are recognized in other income, net in the current
    period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency
    forward non-designated hedging contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $848.6 million and
    $483.2 million, respectively.

    respectively, were recorded at cost, which approximates fair
    value and are included in cash and cash equivalents.

The amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross
    unrealized holding losses and estimated fair value of
     available-for-sale 
    securities by major security type and class of security at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

U.S. government-sponsored agency securities include general
    unsecured obligations either issued directly by or guaranteed by
    U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.
    U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed
    securities, or MBS, includes mortgage-backed securities issued

    securities, which have been in an unrealized loss position for
    less than and longer than 12 months at December 31,
    2010 was as follows:

The Company believes that the decline in fair value of
    securities held at December 31, 2010 below their cost is
    temporary and intends to retain its investment in these
    securities for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery
    in the market value of these investments. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company determined that certain
    securities had sustained an
     other-than-temporary 
    impairment partly due to a reduction in future estimated cash
    flows and an adverse change in an investee s business
    operations. The Company recognized impairment losses of
    $6.5 million in 2008 which were recorded in interest and

Notes Payable:   In December 2006, the Company
    purchased an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API,
    manufacturing facility and certain other assets and liabilities
    from Siegfried Ltd. and Siegfried Dienste AG (together referred
    to herein as Siegfried). At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    fair value of the 7.684% note payable to Siegfried
    approximated the carrying value of the note of
    $25.0 million in each year. Assuming other factors are held
    constant, an increase in interest rates generally will result in
    a decrease in the fair value of the note. The note is
    denominated in Swiss francs and its fair value will also be
    affected by changes in the U.S. dollar / Swiss
    franc exchange rate. The carrying value of the note reflects the
    U.S. dollar / Swiss franc exchange rate and Swiss
    interest rates. The note is due to be repaid at the end of June
    2016.

In June 2003, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount
    of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes due June
    2008, referred to herein as the convertible notes. The
    convertible notes had a five-year term and a coupon rate of
    1.75% payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. Each
    $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes was convertible
    into 82.5592 shares of common stock as adjusted, or a
    conversion price of $12.1125 per share. As of their maturity
    date, June 1, 2008, pursuant to the terms of the indenture,
    as amended, governing the convertible notes, substantially all
    of the convertible notes were converted into an aggregate
    33,022,740 shares of common stock at the conversion price,
    with the balance paid in cash.

Intangible
    Assets and Goodwill  

Intangible Assets:   The Company s
    intangible assets consist of developed product rights from the
    Pharmion, Gloucester and Abraxis acquisitions, IPR D
    product rights from the Gloucester and Abraxis acquisitions,
    contract-based licenses, technology and other. The amortization
    periods related to non-IPR D intangibles ranges from two to
    17 years. The following summary of intangible assets by
    category includes intangibles currently being amortized and
    intangibles not yet subject to amortization:

The $3.104 billion increase in gross carrying value of
    intangibles at December 31, 2010 compared to
    December 31, 2009 was primarily due to the acquisitions of
    Abraxis and Gloucester, which resulted in increases in acquired
    developed product rights of $1.170 billion from Abraxis and
    $197.0 million from Gloucester, licenses of
    $60.0 million from Abraxis, technology and other of
    $37.5 million from Abraxis and acquired IPR D product
    rights of $1.290 billion from Abraxis and
    $349.0 million from Gloucester.

Amortization of intangible assets was $204.5 million,
    $84.3 million and $104.4 million for the years ended
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amortization expense in 2010
    included $95.8 million of expense associated with an
    acceleration of amortization for the
    VIDAZA   

    intangible, which reflects an updated forecast related to
    VIDAZA   ,

    $21.6 million from the amortization of intangible assets
    acquired in the Abraxis acquisition and $21.8 million from
    the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Gloucester
    acquisition, partially offset by a reduction of
    $19.4 million associated with certain acquired developed
    product rights becoming fully amortized in late 2009. Assuming
    no changes in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets,
    the amortization of intangible assets for the next five years is
    estimated to be approximately $286.3 million for 2011,
    $135.4 million for 2012, $133.7 million for 2013,
    $129.7 million for 2014 and $125.4 million for 2015.

Goodwill:   At December 31, 2010, the
    Company s goodwill related to the October 2010 acquisition
    of Abraxis, the January 2010 acquisition of Gloucester, the
    March 2008 acquisition of Pharmion and the October 2004
    acquisition of Penn T Limited.

The change in carrying value of goodwill is summarized as
    follows:

Summarized below are the carrying values of the Company s
    senior notes:

On October 7, 2010, the Company issued a total of
    $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting
    of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    2.45% Senior Notes due 2015 (the  2015 notes ),
    $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.95% Senior Notes due 2020 (the  2020 notes )
    and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.7% Senior Notes due 2040 (the  2040 notes  and,
    together with the 2015 notes and the 2020 notes, referred to
    herein as the  notes ). The notes were issued at
    99.854%, 99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the
    discount will be amortized as additional interest expense over
    the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of
    approximately $10.3 million have been recorded as debt
    issuance costs on the Company s consolidated balance sheet
    and are amortized as additional interest expense using the
    effective interest rate method over the period from issuance
    through maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually
    in arrears on April 15 and October 15 each year beginning
    April 15, 2011 and the principal on each note is due in
    full at their respective maturity dates. The notes may be
    redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at
    any time at a redemption price defined in a make-whole clause
    equaling accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of
    the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of
    the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
    interest and principal. If a change of control of the Company
    occurs accompanied by a downgrade of the debt to below
    investment grade, the Company will be required to offer to
    repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company
    is subject to covenants which limit the ability of the Company
    to pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements
    and limit the ability of the Company to perform sale and
    leaseback transactions involving the property of the Company.

At December 31, 2010, the fair value of the Company s
    Senior Notes outstanding was $1.197 billion.

The notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations
    and will rank equally with any of its future senior unsecured
    indebtedness.

    respectively, related to stock option exercises. Such tendered
    shares are reflected as treasury stock.

In April 2009, the Company s Board of Directors approved a
    $500.0 million common share repurchase program and, on
    December 15, 2010, authorized the repurchase of up to an
    additional $500.0 million common shares, extending the

    an aggregate 7,561,228 common shares were repurchased under the
    program at an average price of $51.92 per common share and total
    cost of $392.6 million.

On February 16, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $1.0 billion of the Company s common shares during a
    repurchase period ending in December 2012. This authorization is
    in addition to the $500.0 million authorization made on

Share-Based
    Compensation  

The Company has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan, the
    2008 Stock Incentive Plan as amended and restated in 2009, or
    the Plan, that provides for the granting of options, restricted
    stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and
    other share-based awards to employees and officers of the
    Company. The Management Compensation and Development Committee
    of the Board of Directors, or the Compensation

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

Committee, may determine the type, amount and terms, including
    vesting, of any awards made under the plan. The Plan provides
    for an aggregate share reserve of 70,781,641 shares of
    common stock. Each share of common stock subject to full value
    awards (e.g., restricted stock, other stock-based awards or
    performance awards denominated in common stock) will be counted
    as 1.6 shares against the aggregate share reserve under the
    Plan.

In accordance with the Plan, each new Non-Employee Director,
    upon the date of election or appointment, receives an award of a
    nonqualified stock option to purchase 25,000 shares of
    common stock, which vest in four equal annual installments
    commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Upon
    election as a continuing member of the Board of Directors, an
    award is granted of a nonqualified stock option to purchase
    12,333 shares of common stock and 2,055 Restricted Stock
    Units, or RSUs, in each case, pro rated for partial years. The
    stock options vest in full on the first anniversary of the date
    of the grant and the RSUs vest ratably over a three-year period.
    The foregoing split between stock options and RSUs is based on a
    two-thirds and one-third mix of stock options to RSUs,
    respectively, using a
     three-to-one 
    ratio of stock options to RSUs in calculating the number of
    RSUs. No discretionary award is permitted to be granted to
    Non-Employee Directors, and the Compensation Committee will
    administer the Plan with respect to awards for Non-Employee
    Directors.

With respect to options granted under the Plan, the exercise
    price may not be less than the market closing price of the
    common stock on the date of grant. In general, options granted
    under the Plan vest over periods ranging from immediate vesting
    to four-year vesting and expire ten years from the date of
    grant, subject to earlier expiration in case of termination of
    employment unless the participant meets the retirement provision
    under which the option would have a maximum of three additional
    years to vest. The vesting period for options granted under the
    Plan is subject to certain acceleration provisions if a change
    in control, as defined in the Plan, occurs. Plan participants
    may elect to exercise options at any time during the option
    term. However, any shares so purchased which have not vested as
    of the date of exercise shall be subject to forfeiture, which
    will lapse in accordance with the established vesting time
    period.

Shares of common stock available for future share-based grants
    under all plans were 15,605,593 at December 31, 2010.

The following table summarizes the components of share-based
    compensation expense in the consolidated statements of
    operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008:

Included in share-based compensation expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was compensation expense
    related to non-qualified stock options of $142.6 million,
    $117.0 million and $77.5 million, respectively.

Share-based compensation cost included in inventory was
    $2.4 million and $1.9 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, there
    was $315.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to stock options granted under the plans. That cost will
    be recognized over an expected remaining weighted-average period
    of 2.3 years.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes method of valuation to
    determine the fair value of share-based awards. Compensation
    cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite
    service has not been rendered that are

outstanding is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
    Operations over the remaining service period based on the
    award s original estimate of fair value and the estimated
    number of awards expected to vest after taking into
    consideration an estimated forfeiture rate.

The Company does not recognize a deferred tax asset for excess
    tax benefits that have not been realized and has adopted the tax
    law method as its accounting policy regarding the ordering of
    tax benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been
    realized.

Stock Options:   Cash received from stock option
    exercises for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was $88.3 million, $49.8 million and
    $128.6 million, respectively, and the excess tax benefit
    recognized was $36.1 million, $97.8 million and
    $153.0 million, respectively.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of the stock options
    granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was $18.59 per share, $20.10 per share and $25.94 per
    share, respectively. The Company estimated the fair value of
    options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
    the following assumptions:

The fair value of stock options granted is allocated to
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis. Compensation cost is
    allocated over the requisite service periods of the awards,
    which are generally the vesting periods.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
    zero-coupon curve. Expected volatility of stock option awards is
    estimated based on the implied volatility of the Company s
    publicly traded options with settlement dates of six months. The
    use of implied volatility was based upon the availability of
    actively traded options on the Company s common stock and
    the assessment that implied volatility is more representative of
    future stock price trends than historical volatility. The
    expected term of an employee share option is the period of time
    for which the option is expected to be outstanding. The Company
    has made a determination of expected term by analyzing
    employees  historical exercise experience from its history
    of grants and exercises in the Company s option database
    and management estimates. Forfeiture rates are estimated based
    on historical data.

    $109.6 million, $157.3 million and
    $443.7 million, respectively. The Company primarily
    utilizes newly issued shares to satisfy the exercise of stock
    options.

The following table summarizes information concerning options
    outstanding under all plans at December 31, 2010:

Stock options granted to executives at the vice-president level
    and above under the Plan, formerly the 1998 Stock Incentive
    Plan, after September 18, 2000, contained a reload feature
    which provided that if (1) the optionee exercises all or
    any portion of the stock option (a) at least six months
    prior to the expiration of the stock option, (b) while
    employed by the Company and (c) prior to the expiration
    date of the Plan and (2) the optionee pays the exercise
    price for the portion of the stock option exercised or the
    minimum statutory applicable withholding taxes by using common
    stock owned by the optionee for at least six months prior to the
    date of exercise, the optionee shall be granted a new stock
    option under the Plan on the date all or any portion of the
    stock option is exercised to purchase the number of shares of
    common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock
    exchanged by the

optionee. The reload stock option is exercisable on the same
    terms and conditions as apply to the original stock option
    except that (x) the reload stock option will become
    exercisable in full on the day which is six months after the
    date the original stock option is exercised, (y) the
    exercise price shall be the fair value (as defined in the Plan)
    of the common stock on the date the reload stock option is
    granted and (z) the expiration of the reload stock option
    will be the date of expiration of the original stock option. As
    of December 31, 2010, 167,122 options that contain the
    reload features noted above are still outstanding and are
    included in the tables above. The Plan was amended to eliminate
    the reload feature for all stock options granted on or after
    October 1, 2004.

Restricted Stock Units:   The Company began
    issuing restricted stock units, or RSUs, under its equity
    program during the second quarter of 2009 in order to provide an
    effective incentive award with a strong retention component.
    Equity awards may, at the option of employee participants, be
    divided between stock options and restricted stock units, or
    RSUs. The employee has three choices: (1) 100% stock
    options; (2) a mix of stock options and RSUs based on a
    two-thirds and one-third mix, using a
     three-to-one 
    ratio of stock options to RSUs in calculating the number of RSUs
    to be granted; or (3) a mix of stock options and RSUs based
    on a fifty-fifty mix, using a
     three-to-one 
    ratio of stock options to RSUs in calculating the number of RSUs
    to be granted. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the
    closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant
    dates. Information regarding the Company s RSUs for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:

As of December 31, 2010, there was $62.4 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
    awards of RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 2.2 years. The Company
    recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period for the entire award, as adjusted for
    expected forfeitures. The Company primarily utilizes newly
    issued shares to satisfy the vesting of RSUs.

    been made in the form of the Company s common stock (See
    Note 14). Such contributions are based on specified
    percentages of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible
    compensation or a maximum permitted by law. Total expense for
    contributions to the U.S. savings plans were
    $14.4 million, $10.6 million and $8.3 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company also sponsors
    defined contribution plans in certain foreign locations.
    Participation in these plans is subject to the local laws that
    are in effect for each country and may include statutorily
    imposed minimum contributions. The Company also maintains
    defined benefit plans in certain foreign locations for which the
    obligations and the net periodic pension costs were determined
    to be immaterial at December 31, 2010.

In 2000, the Company s Board of Directors approved a
    deferred compensation plan effective September 1, 2000. In
    February 2005, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the
    Celgene Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, effective
    as of January 1, 2005, and amended the plan in February
    2008. This plan operates as

the Company s ongoing deferred compensation plan and is
    intended to comply with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,
    which added new Section 409A to the Code, changing the
    income tax treatment, design and administration of certain plans
    that provide for the deferral of compensation. The
    Company s Board of Directors froze the 2000 deferred
    compensation plan, effective as of December 31, 2004, and
    no additional contributions or deferrals can be made to that
    plan. Accrued benefits under the frozen plan will continue to be
    governed by the terms under the tax laws in effect prior to the
    enactment of Section 409A. Eligible participants, which
    include certain top-level executives of the Company as specified
    by the plan, can elect to defer up to an amended 90% of the
    participant s base salary, 100% of cash bonuses and equity
    compensation allowed under Section 409A of the Code.
    Company contributions to the deferred compensation plan
    represent a match to certain participants  deferrals up to
    a specified percentage (currently ranging from 10% to 20%,
    depending on the employee s position as specified in the
    plan, and ranging from 10% to 25% through December 31,
    2006) of the participant s base salary. The Company
    recorded expense of $1.5 million, $0.4 million and
    $0.5 million related to the deferred compensation plans in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company s recurring
    matches are fully vested, upon contribution. All other Company
    contributions to the plan do not vest until the specified
    requirements are met. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company had a deferred compensation liability included in other
    non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of
    approximately $46.3 million and $36.6 million,
    respectively, which included the participant s elected
    deferral of salaries and bonuses, the Company s matching
    contribution and earnings on deferred amounts as of that date.
    The plan provides various alternatives for the measurement of
    earnings on the amounts participants defer under the plan. The
    measuring alternatives are based on returns of a variety of
    funds that offer plan participants the option to spread their
    risk across a diverse group of investments.

In 2003, the Company established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or
    LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with
    performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon
    achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives
    covering a three-year period. The Company currently has three
    separate three-year performance cycles running concurrently
    ending December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Performance
    measures for the Plans are based on the following components in
    the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP earnings
    per share, 25% on non-GAAP net income and 50% on total non-GAAP
    revenue, as defined.

Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the
    participant s salary for the LTIPs. The estimated payout
    for the concluded 2010 Plan is $6.8 million, which is
    included in other current liabilities at December 31, 2010,
    and the maximum potential payout, assuming maximum objectives
    are achieved for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 Plans are
    $9.5 million, $11.3 million and $18.4 million,
    respectively. Such awards are payable in cash or, at the
    Company s discretion, payable in common stock based upon
    its stock price on the payout date. The Company accrues the
    long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior
    to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an
    estimate of the Company s level of achievement during the
    cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled
    to an immediate payment equal to their target award or, if
    higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of
    the change in control. For the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized expense related to
    the LTIP of $8.1 million, $5.5 million and
    $6.3 million, respectively.

The income tax provision is based on income (loss) before income
    taxes as follows:

The provision (benefit) for taxes on income is as follows:

Amounts are reflected in the preceding tables based on the
    location of the taxing authorities. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company has not made a U.S. tax provision on
    $3.934 billion of unremitted earnings of its international
    subsidiaries. These earnings are expected to be reinvested
    overseas indefinitely. It is not practicable to compute the
    estimated deferred tax liability on these earnings.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect on
    these temporary differences as deferred tax assets (generally
    items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future
    periods) or deferred tax liabilities (generally items for which
    the Company received a tax deduction but that have not yet been
    recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations). The
    Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization
    of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these
    deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it
    believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers
    many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization
    of deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings
    experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future
    taxable income, the carryforward periods available to it for tax
    reporting purposes, tax planning strategies and other relevant
    factors. Significant judgment is required in making this
    assessment.

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

The Company operates under an income tax holiday in Switzerland
    through 2015 that exempts the Company from Swiss income taxes on
    most of its operations in Switzerland. The impact of the Swiss
    tax holiday is reflected in the Company s effective tax
    rate. The difference between the maximum statutory Swiss income
    tax rate (22.18% in 2010, 2009, and 2008) and the
    Company s Swiss income tax rate under the tax holiday
    resulted in a reduction in the 2010, 2009, and 2008 effective
    tax rates of 15.8, 11.4, and 3.4 percentage points,
    respectively. The impact of this item is included in the foreign
    rate differential line in the above table.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had federal net operating
    loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $280.0 million and combined
    state NOL carryforwards of approximately $616.1 million
    that will expire in the years 2011 through 2030. The Company
    also has research and experimentation credit carryforwards of
    approximately $24.8 million that will expire in the years
    2015 through 2028. Excess tax benefits related to stock option
    deductions incurred after December 31, 2005 are required to
    be recognized in the period in which the tax deduction is
    realized through a reduction of income taxes payable. As a
    result, the Company has not recorded deferred tax assets for
    certain stock option deductions included in its state NOL
    carryforwards and research and experimentation credit
    carryforwards. At December 31, 2010, deferred tax assets
    have not been recorded on state NOL carryforwards of
    approximately $124.9 million and for research and
    experimentation credits of approximately $9.5 million.
    These stock option tax benefits will be recorded as an increase
    in additional paid-in capital when realized.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, it was more likely than not
    that the Company would realize its deferred tax assets, net of
    valuation allowances. The principal valuation allowance relates
    to Swiss deferred tax assets and is the result of the Swiss tax
    holiday that does not expire until the end of 2015.

The Company realized stock option deduction benefits in 2010,
    2009 and 2008 for income tax purposes and has increased
    additional paid-in capital in the amount of approximately
    $32.5 million, $98.8 million and $160.6 million,
    respectively. The Company has recorded deferred income taxes as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income resulting
    in a deferred income tax asset at December 31, 2010 of
    $0.3 million and a deferred income tax liability at
    December 31, 2009 of $0.1 million.

The Company s U.S. federal income tax returns have
    been audited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the
    IRS, through the year ended December 31, 2005. Tax returns
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 are
    currently under examination by the IRS and scheduled to be
    completed within the next 12 months. The Company is also
    subject to audits by various state and foreign taxing
    authorities, including, but not limited to, most
    U.S. states and major European and Asian countries where
    the Company has operations.

The Company regularly reevaluates its tax positions and the
    associated interest and penalties, if applicable, resulting from
    audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, as well
    as changes in tax law that would reduce the technical merits of
    the position to below more likely than not. The Company believes
    that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open
    years. Many factors are considered in making these evaluations,
    including past history, recent interpretations of tax law and
    the specifics of each matter. Because tax regulations are
    subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently
    uncertain, these evaluations can involve a series of complex
    judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates
    and assumptions. The Company applies a variety of methodologies
    in making these estimates and assumptions, which include studies
    performed by independent economists, advice from industry and
    subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the IRS
    and other taxing authorities, as well as the Company s
    industry experience. These evaluations are based on estimates
    and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management.
    However, if management s estimates are not representative
    of actual outcomes, the Company s results of operations
    could be materially impacted.

Unrecognized tax benefits, generally represented by liabilities
    on the consolidated balance sheet and all subject to tax
    examinations, arise when the estimated benefit recorded in the
    financial statements differs from the

amounts taken or expected to be taken in a tax return because of
    the uncertainties described above. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as
    follows:

These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues
    common among multinational corporations. If recognized,
    unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $504.7 million
    would have a net impact on the effective tax rate. The Company
    accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions as part of its provision for income taxes. Accrued
    interest at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is approximately
    $32.5 million and $21.2 million, respectively.

The Company effectively settled examinations with various taxing
    jurisdictions in 2010 and 2009. These settlements resulted in
    decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related
    to tax positions taken in prior years of $29.3 million in
    2010 and $35.8 million in 2009. The Company has recorded
    increases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for
    prior years related to ongoing income tax audits in various
    taxing jurisdictions.

The Company s tax returns are under routine examination in
    many taxing jurisdictions. The scope of these examinations
    includes, but is not limited to, the review of our taxable
    presence in a jurisdiction, our deduction of certain items, our
    claim for research and development credits, our compliance with
    transfer pricing rules and regulations and the inclusion or
    exclusion of amounts from our tax returns as filed. Certain of
    these examinations are scheduled to conclude within the next
    12 months. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change by a
    significant amount during the next
     12-month 
    period. Finalizing examinations with the relevant taxing
    authorities can include formal administrative and legal
    proceedings and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the
    timing and range of possible changes related to our unrecognized
    tax benefits. An estimate of the range of the possible change
    cannot be made until issues are further developed or
    examinations close.

Novartis Pharma AG:   The Company entered into
    an agreement with Novartis in which the Company granted to
    Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding Canada) to
    develop and market
    FOCALIN   

    (d-methylphenidate, or d -MPH) and FOCALIN
    XR   ,

    the long-acting drug formulation for attention deficit disorder,
    or ADD, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
    The Company also granted Novartis rights to all of its related
    intellectual property and patents, including formulations of the
    currently marketed RITALIN
    LA   .

    Under the agreement, the Company is entitled to receive up to
    $100.0 million in upfront and regulatory achievement
    milestone payments. To date, the Company has received upfront
    and regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling
    $55.0 million. The Company also sells
    FOCALIN   

    to Novartis and currently receives royalties of between 35% and
    30% on sales of all of Novartis  FOCALIN
    XR   

    and
    RITALIN   

    family of ADHD-related products.

The agreement will continue until the later of (i) the
    tenth anniversary of the first commercial launch on a
     country-by-country 
    basis or (ii) when the last applicable patent expires with
    respect to that country. At the expiration date, the Company
    shall grant Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free
    license to make, have made, use, import and sell d-MPH and
    Ritalin   

    under its technology.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

i. Novartis at their sole discretion, effective
    12 months after written notice to the Company, or

ii. by:

a. 

either party if the other party materially breaches any of its
    material obligations under the agreement,

b. 

the Company if Novartis fails to pay amounts due under the
    agreement two or more times in a

    period,

c. 

either party, on a
     product-by-product 
    and

    basis, in the event of withdrawal of the d-MPH product or
    Ritalin   

    product from the market because of regulatory mandate,

d. 

either party if the other party files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by the Company then all licenses
    granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate and
    Novartis will also grant the Company a non-exclusive license to
    certain of their intellectual property related to the compounds
    and products.

If the agreement is terminated by Novartis then all licenses
    granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate.

If the agreement is terminated by Novartis because of a material
    breach by the Company, then Novartis can make a claim for
    damages against the Company and the Company shall grant Novartis
    a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make, have
    made, use, import and sell d-MPH and
    Ritalin   

    under the Company s technology.

When generic versions of long-acting methylphenidate
    hydrochloride and dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride enter the
    market, the Company expects Novartis  sales of Ritalin
    LA   

    and Focalin
    XR   

    products to decrease and therefore its royalties under this
    agreement to also decrease.

Array BioPharma Inc.:   The Company has a
    research collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma Inc., or
    Array, focused on the discovery, development and
    commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and
    inflammation. As part of this agreement, the Company made an
    upfront payment in September 2007 to Array of
    $40.0 million, which was recorded as research and
    development expense, in return for an option to receive
    exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against two
    of the four research targets defined in the agreement, except
    for Array s limited U.S. co-promotional rights. In
    June 2009, the Company made an additional upfront payment of
    $4.5 million to expand the research targets defined in the
    agreement, which was recorded as research and development
    expense. Array will be responsible for all discovery and
    clinical development through Phase I or Phase IIa and be
    entitled to receive, for each compound, potential milestone
    payments of approximately $200.0 million if certain
    discovery, development and regulatory milestones are achieved,
    and $300.0 million if certain commercial milestones are
    achieved as well as royalties on net sales. During the fourth
    quarter of 2010, the Company made a $10.0 million discovery
    milestone payment as required by the collaboration upon the
    filing and clearance of an investigational new drug application
    with the FDA.

The Company s option will terminate upon the earlier of
    either a termination of the agreement, the date the Company has
    exercised its options for compounds developed against two of the
    four research targets defined in the agreement, or
    September 21, 2012, unless the term is extended. The
    Company may unilaterally extend the option term for two
    additional one-year terms until September 21, 2014 and the
    parties may mutually extend the term for two additional one-year
    terms until September 21, 2016. Upon exercise of a Company
    option, the agreement will continue until the Company has
    satisfied all royalty payment obligations to Array. Upon the
    expiration of the agreement, Array will grant the Company a
    fully
     paid-up, 
    royalty-free license to use certain intellectual property of
    Array to market and sell the compounds and products developed
    under the agreement. The agreement may expire on

If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole
    discretion or by Array for a material breach by the Company,
    then the Company s rights to the compounds and products
    developed under the agreement will revert to Array. If the
    agreement is terminated by Array for a material breach by the
    Company, then the Company will also grant to Array a
    non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual
    property controlled by the Company necessary to continue the
    development of such compounds and products. If the agreement is
    terminated by the Company for a material breach by Array, then,

Acceleron Pharma:   The Company has a worldwide
    strategic collaboration with Acceleron Pharma, or Acceleron, for
    the joint development and commercialization of ACE-011,
    currently being studied for treatment of chemotherapy-induced
    anemia, metastatic bone disease and renal anemia. The
    collaboration combines both companies  resources and
    commitment to developing products for the treatment of cancer
    and cancer-related bone loss. The agreement also includes an
    option for certain discovery stage programs. Under the terms of
    the agreement, the Company and Acceleron will jointly develop,
    manufacture and commercialize Acceleron s products for bone
    loss. The Company made an upfront payment to Acceleron in
    February 2008 of $50.0 million, which included a
    $5.0 million equity investment in Acceleron, with the
    remainder recorded as research and development expense. In
    addition, in the event of an initial public offering of
    Acceleron, the Company will purchase a minimum of
    $7.0 million of Acceleron common stock.

Acceleron will retain responsibility for initial activities,
    including research and development, through the end of Phase IIa
    clinical trials, as well as manufacturing the clinical supplies
    for these studies. In turn, the Company will conduct the Phase
    IIb and Phase III clinical studies and will oversee the
    manufacture of Phase III and commercial supplies. Acceleron
    will pay a share of the development expenses and is eligible to
    receive development, regulatory approval and sales-based
    milestones of up to $510.0 million for the ACE-011 program
    and up to an additional $437.0 million for each of the
    three discovery stage programs. The companies will co-promote
    the products in North America. Acceleron will receive tiered
    royalties on worldwide net sales, upon the commercialization of
    a development compound.

The agreement will continue until the Company has satisfied all
    royalty payment obligations to Acceleron and the Company has
    either exercised or forfeited all of its options under the
    agreement. Upon the Company s full satisfaction of its
    royalty payment obligations to Acceleron under the agreement,
    all licenses granted to the Company by Acceleron under the
    agreement will become fully
     paid-up, 
    perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable and royalty-free licenses.
    The agreement may expire on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis as the Company satisfies its royalty payment obligation
    with respect to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be

Cabrellis Pharmaceuticals Corp.:   The Company,
    as a result of its acquisition of Pharmion, obtained an
    exclusive license to develop and commercialize amrubicin in
    North America and Europe pursuant to a license agreement with
    Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd, or DSP. Pursuant to
    Pharmion s acquisition of Cabrellis Pharmaceutics Corp., or
    Cabrellis, prior to the Company s acquisition of Pharmion,
    the Company will pay $12.5 million for each approval of
    amrubicin in an initial indication by regulatory authorities in
    the United States and the E.U. to the former shareholders of
    Cabrellis. Upon approval of amrubicin for a second indication in
    the United States or the E.U., the Company will pay an
    additional $10.0 million for each market to the former
    shareholders of Cabrellis. Under the terms of the license
    agreement for amrubicin, the Company is required to make
    milestone payments of $7.0 million and $1.0 million to
    DSP upon regulatory approval of amrubicin in the United States
    and upon receipt of the first approval in the E.U.,
    respectively, and up to $17.5 million upon achieving
    certain annual sales levels in the United States. Pursuant to
    the supply agreement for amrubicin, the Company is to pay DSP a
    semiannual supply price calculated as a percentage of net sales
    for a period of ten years. In September 2008, amrubicin was
    granted fast-track product designation by the FDA for the
    treatment of small cell lung cancer after first-line
    chemotherapy.

The amrubicin license expires on a

    basis upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the
    first commercial sale of the applicable product in a given
    country after the issuance of marketing authorization in such
    country and (ii) the first day of the first quarter for
    which the total number of generic product units sold in a given
    country exceeds 20% of the total number of generic product units
    sold plus licensed product units sold in the relevant country
    during the same calendar quarter.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the amrubicin
    license may be terminated by:

(i) the Company at its sole discretion,

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches any of its material obligations
    under the agreement, or

b. files for bankruptcy,

(iii) DSP if the Company takes any action to challenge the
    title or validity of the patents owned by DSP, or

(iv) DSP in the event of a change in control of the Company.

If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole
    discretion or by DSP under circumstances described in clauses
    (ii)(a) and (iii) above, then the Company will transfer its
    rights to the compounds and products developed under the
    agreement to DSP and will also grant to DSP a non-exclusive,
    perpetual, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property
    controlled by the Company necessary to continue the development
    of such compounds and products. If the agreement is terminated
    by the Company for a material breach by DSP, then, among other
    things, DSP will grant to the Company an exclusive, perpetual,
     paid-up 
    license to all of the intellectual property of DSP necessary to
    continue the development, marketing and selling of the compounds
    and products subject to the agreement.

GlobeImmune, Inc.:   In September 2007, the
    Company made a $3.0 million equity investment in
    GlobeImmune, Inc., or GlobeImmune. In April 2009 and May 2009,
    the Company made additional $0.1 million and
    $10.0 million equity investments, respectively, in
    GlobeImmune. In addition, the Company has a collaboration and
    option agreement with GlobeImmune focused on the discovery,
    development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in
    cancer. As part of this agreement, the Company made an upfront
    payment in May 2009 of $30.0 million, which was recorded as
    research and development expense, to GlobeImmune in return for
    the option to license compounds and products based on the
    GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate
    programs as well as oncology compounds and products resulting
    from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune. GlobeImmune will
    be responsible for all discovery and clinical development until
    the Company exercises its option with respect to a drug
    candidate program and GlobeImmune will be entitled to receive
    potential milestone payments of approximately
    $230.0 million for the GI-4000 program, $145.0 million
    for each of the
     GI-6200, 
    GI-3000 and GI-10000 programs and $161.0 million for each
    additional future program if certain development, regulatory and
    sales-based milestones are achieved. GlobeImmune will also
    receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.

The Company s options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200,
    GI-3000 and GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs will
    terminate if the Company does not exercise its respective
    options after delivery of certain reports from GlobeImmune on
    the completed clinical trials with respect to each drug
    candidate program, as set forth in the initial development plan
    specified in the agreement. If the Company does not exercise its
    options with respect to any drug candidate program or future
    program, the Company s option with respect to the oncology
    products resulting from future programs controlled by
    GlobeImmune will terminate three years after the last of the
    options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and
    GI-10000 oncology drug candidate programs terminates. Upon
    exercise of a Company option, the agreement will continue until
    the Company has satisfied all royalty payment obligations to
    GlobeImmune. Upon the expiration of the agreement, on a
     product-by-product, 
     country-by-country 
    basis, GlobeImmune will grant the Company an exclusive, fully
     paid-up, 
    royalty-free, perpetual license to use certain intellectual
    property of GlobeImmune to market and sell the compounds and
    products developed under the agreement. The agreement may expire
    on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis as the Company satisfies its royalty payment obligation
    with respect to each product in each country.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

(i) the Company at its sole discretion, or

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches any of its material obligations
    under the agreement, or

b. files for bankruptcy.

If the agreement is terminated by the Company at its sole
    discretion or by GlobeImmune for a material breach by the
    Company, then the Company s rights to the compounds and
    products developed under the agreement will revert to
    GlobeImmune. If the agreement is terminated by the Company for a
    material breach by GlobeImmune, then, among other things, the
    Company s royalty payment obligations under the agreement
    will be reduced by 50%, the Company s development milestone
    payment obligations under the agreement will be reduced by 50%
    or terminated entirely and the Company s sales milestone
    payment obligations under the agreement will be terminated
    entirely.

Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:   On April 14,
    2010, the Company entered into a discovery and development
    collaboration and license agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals,
    Inc., or Agios, which focuses on cancer metabolism targets and
    the discovery, development and commercialization of associated
    therapeutics. As part of the agreement, the Company paid Agios a
    $121.2 million non-refundable, upfront payment, which was
    expensed by the Company as research and development in the
    second quarter of 2010. The Company also made an
    $8.8 million equity investment in Agios Series B
    Convertible Preferred Stock, representing approximately a 10.94%

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

ownership interest in Agios and is included in other non-current
    assets in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
    Company receives an initial period of exclusivity during which
    it has the option to develop any drugs resulting from the Agios
    cancer metabolism research platform and may extend this
    exclusivity period by providing Agios additional funding. The
    Company has an exclusive option to license any resulting
    clinical candidates developed during this period and will lead
    and fund global development and commercialization of certain
    licensed programs. With respect to each product in a program
    that the Company chooses to license, Agios could receive up to
    $120.0 million upon achievement of certain milestones plus
    royalties on sales, and Agios may also participate in the
    development and commercialization of certain products in the
    United States. Agios may also receive a one-time milestone
    payment of $25.0 million upon dosing of the final human
    subject in a Phase II study, such payment to be made only
    once with respect to only one program.

Unless the agreement is earlier terminated or the option term is
    extended, the Company s option will terminate on
    April 14, 2013. However, if certain development targets are
    not met, the Company may unilaterally extend the option term:
    (a) for up to an additional one year without payment;
    (b) subject to certain criteria and upon payment of certain
    predetermined amounts to Agios, for up to two additional years
    thereafter.

Following expiration of the option, the agreement will continue
    in place with respect to programs to which the Company has
    exercised its option or otherwise is granted rights to develop.
    The agreement may expire on a
     product-by-product 
    and
     country-by-country 
    basis as the Company satisfies its payment obligation with
    respect to each product in each country. Upon the expiration of
    the agreement with respect to a product in a country, all
    licenses granted by one party to the other party for such
    product in such country shall become fully
     paid-up, 
    perpetual, sub licensable, irrevocable and royalty-free.

Prior to its expiration as described above, the agreement may be
    terminated by:

(i) the Company at its sole discretion after, or

(ii) either party if the other party:

a. materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such
    breach within the specified period, or

b. files for bankruptcy.

The party terminating under (i) or (ii)(a) above has the
    right to terminate on a
     program-by-program 
    basis, leaving the agreement in effect with respect to remaining
    programs. If the agreement or any program is terminated by the
    Company for convenience or by Agios for a material breach or
    bankruptcy by the Company, then, among other things, depending
    on the type of program and territorial rights: (a) certain
    licenses granted by the Company to Agios shall stay in place,
    subject to Agios  payment of certain royalties to the
    Company: and (b) Celgene will grant Agios a non-exclusive,
    perpetual, royalty-free license to certain technology developed
    in the conduct of the collaboration and used in the program
    (which license is exclusive with respect to certain limited
    collaboration technology). If the agreement or any program is
    terminated by the Company for a material breach or bankruptcy by
    Agios, then, among other things, all licenses granted by Celgene
    to Agios will terminate and: (i) Celgene s license
    from Agios will continue in perpetuity and all payment
    obligations will be reduced or will terminate;
    (ii) Celgene s license for certain programs will
    become exclusive worldwide: and (iii) with regard to any
    program where the Company has exercised buy-in rights, Agios
    shall continue to pay certain royalties to Celgene.

The Company has determined that Agios is a variable interest
    entity; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of
    Agios. Although the Company would have the right to receive the
    benefits from the collaboration and license agreement and it is
    probable that this agreement incorporates the activities that
    most significantly impact the economic performance of Agios for
    up to six years, the Company does not have the power to direct
    the activities under the collaboration and license agreement as
    Agios has the decision-making authority for the Joint Steering
    Committee and Joint Research Committee until the Company
    exercises its option to license a product. The Company s
    interest in Agios is limited to its 10.94% equity ownership and
    it does not have any obligations or rights to the future losses
    or returns of Agios beyond this ownership. The collaboration
    agreement, including the upfront

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

payment and series B convertible preferred stock
    investment, does not entitle the Company to participate in
    future returns beyond the 10.94% ownership and it does not
    obligate the Company to absorb future losses beyond the
    $8.8 million investment in Agios Series B Convertible
    Preferred Stock. In addition, there are no other agreements
    other than the collaboration agreement that entitle the Company
    to receive returns beyond the 10.94% ownership or obligate the
    Company to absorb additional losses.

Commitments
    and Contingencies  

Leases:   The Company leases offices and
    research facilities under various operating lease agreements in
    the United States and international markets. At
    December 31, 2010, the non-cancelable lease terms for the
    operating leases expire at various dates between 2011 and 2018
    and include renewal options. In general, the Company is also
    required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes,
    insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs
    associated with the leases.

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating
    leases as of December 31, 2010 are:

Total rental expense under operating leases was approximately
    $36.4 million in 2010, $24.4 million in 2009 and
    $20.4 million in 2008.

Lines of Credit:   The Company maintains lines
    of credit with several banks to support its hedging programs and
    to facilitate the issuance of bank letters of credit and
    guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries. Lines of credit
    supporting the Company s hedging programs as of
    December 31, 2010 allowed the Company to enter into
    derivative contracts with settlement dates through 2013. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company has entered into derivative
    contracts with net notional amounts totaling $1.6 billion.
    Lines of credit facilitating the issuance of bank letters of
    credit and guarantees as of December 31, 2010 allowed the
    Company to have letters of credit and guarantees issued on
    behalf of its subsidiaries totaling $41.6 million.

Other Commitments:   The Company s
    obligations related to product supply contracts totaled
    $362.5 million at December 31, 2010. The Company also
    owns an interest in two limited partnership investment funds.
    The Company has committed to invest an additional
    $8.0 million into one of the funds which is callable any
    time within a ten-year period, which expires on
    February 28, 2016.

Collaboration Arrangements:   The Company has
    entered into certain research and development collaboration
    agreements, as identified in Note 18, with third parties
    that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing
    and commercialization efforts with the potential for future
    milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of
    pre-established developmental, regulatory
     and/or 
    commercial targets. The Company s obligation to fund these
    efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs
     and/or  the
    lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance
    of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the
    future potential payments are inherently uncertain, and
    accordingly no amounts have been recorded in the Company s
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,
    2010 and 2009.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

Contingencies:   The Company believes it
    maintains insurance coverage adequate for its current needs. The
    Company s operations are subject to environmental laws and
    regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of
    pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for
    the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes. The Company reviews the effects of such laws and
    regulations on its operations and modifies its operations as
    appropriate. The Company believes it is in substantial
    compliance with all applicable environmental laws and
    regulations.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company received a Civil
    Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal Trade
    Commission, or the FTC. The FTC requested documents and other
    information relating to requests by generic companies to
    purchase the Company s patented
    REVLIMID   

    and
    THALOMID   

    brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to
    believe that the Company has engaged in unfair methods of
    competition. In the first quarter of 2010, the State of
    Connecticut referenced the same issues as those referenced in
    the 2009 CID and issued a subpoena. In the fourth quarter of
    2010, the Company received a second CID from the FTC relating to
    this matter. The Company continues to respond to requests for
    information.

In the first quarter of 2011, the Company received a letter from
    the United States Attorney for the Central District of
    California informing the Company that it was under investigation
    relating to its promotion of the drugs
    THALOMID   

    and
    REVLIMID   

    regarding off-label marketing and improper payments to
    physicians. The Company is cooperating with the Unites States
    Attorney in connection with this investigation.

On January 20, 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that
    the jurisdiction of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board,
    or the PMPRB, extends to sales of drugs to Canadian patients
    even if the locus of sale is within the United States. As a
    result of this rulling, the Company s U.S. sales of
    THALOMID   

    brand drug to Canadian patients under the special access program
    are subject to PMPRB jurisdiction on and after January 12,
    1995. In accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court of
    Canada, we have provided to-date data regarding these special
    access program sales to the PMPRB. In light of the approval of
    THALOMID   

    brand drug for multiple myeloma by Health Canada on
    August 4, 2010, this drug is now sold through the
    Company s Canadian entity and is no longer sold to Canadian
    patients in the United States. The PMPRB s proposed pricing
    arrangement has not been determined. Depending on the
    calculation, the Company may be requested to return certain
    revenues associated with these sales and to pay fines. Should
    this occur, the Company would have to consider various legal
    options to address whether the pricing determination was
    reasonable.

Legal
    Proceedings:   

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in
    various patent, commercial and other claims; government
    investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time
    to time in the ordinary course of our business. These legal
    proceedings and other matters are complex in nature and have
    outcomes that are difficult to predict and could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company. The Company records accruals for
    such contingencies to the extent that it concludes that it is
    probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the
    related loss can be reasonably estimated.

Patent proceedings include challenges to scope, validity or
    enforceability of the Company s patents relating to its
    various products or processes. Although the Company believes it
    has substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all
    its material patents, there can be no assurance as to the
    outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could
    result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue,
    which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and
    could materially affect future results of operations.

Among the principal matters pending to which the Company is a
    party, are the following:

REVLIMID     

The Company has publicly announced that it has received a notice
    letter dated August 30, 2010, sent from Natco Pharma
    Limited of India ( Natco ) notifying it of a
    Paragraph IV certification alleging that patents listed for

112

Table of Contents   

CELGENE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

REVLIMID   

    in the Orange Book are invalid,
     and/or  not
    infringed (the Notice Letter). The Notice Letter was sent
    pursuant to Natco having filed an ANDA seeking permission from
    the FDA to market a generic version of 25mg, 15mg, 10mg and 5mg
    capsules of
    REVLIMID   .

    Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic
    manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a
     Paragraph IV certification ) challenging the
    validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDA s
     Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence
    Evaluations  (the  Orange Book ) four years after
    the pioneer company obtains approval of its New Drug
    Application, or an NDA. On October 8, 2010, Celgene filed
    an infringement action in the United States District Court of
    New Jersey against Natco in response to the Notice Letter with
    respect to United States Patent Nos. 5,635,517 (the
      517 patent ), 6,045,501 (the   501
    patent ), 6,281,230 (the   230 patent ),
    6,315,720 (the   720 patent ), 6,555,554 (the
      554 patent ), 6,561,976 (the   976
    patent ), 6,561,977 (the   977 patent ),
    6,755,784 (the   784 patent ), 7,119,106 (the
      106 patent ), and 7,465,800 (the
      800 patent ). If Natco is successful in
    challenging our patents listed in the Orange Book, and the FDA
    were to approve the ANDA with a comprehensive education and risk
    management program for a generic version of lenalidomide, sales
    of
    REVLIMID   

    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic lenalidomide product, potentially reducing
    the Company s revenue.

Natco responded to the Company s infringement action on
    November 18, 2010, with its Answer, Affirmative Defenses
    and Counterclaims. Natco has alleged (through affirmative
    defenses and counterclaims) that the patents are invalid,
    unenforceable
     and/or  not
    infringed by Natco s proposed generic productions. After
    filing the infringement action, we learned the identity of
    Natco s U.S. partner, Arrow International Limited, and
    filed an amended complaint on January 7, 2011, adding Arrow
    as a defendant.

ELAN
    PHARMA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  

On February 23, 2011, the parties entered into a settlement
    and license agreement for $78.0 million, whereby all claims
    were resolved and we obtained the rights to certain patents in
    and related to the litigation including rights to
    U.S. Reissue Patent REI 41,884 (the  Reissued
    Patent ), as well as all foreign counterparts, all of which
    expire in 2016. Prior to the settlement, on July 19, 2006,
    Elan Pharmaceutical Int l Ltd. filed a lawsuit against the
    predecessor entity of Abraxis ( Old Abraxis ) in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging
    that Old Abraxis willfully infringed two of its patents by
    making, using and selling the
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug. Elan sought unspecified damages and an injunction.
    In response, Old Abraxis contended that it did not infringe the
    Elan patents and that the Elan patents are invalid and
    unenforceable. Before trial, Elan dropped its claim that Old
    Abraxis infringed one of the two asserted patents. Elan also
    dropped its request for an injunction as to the remaining
    patent. On June 13, 2008, after a trial with respect to the
    remaining patent, a jury ruled that Old Abraxis had infringed
    that patent, that Abraxis  infringement was not willful,
    and that the patent was valid and enforceable. The jury awarded
    Elan $55.2 million in damages for sales of
    ABRAXANE   

    through the judgment date. For accounting purposes, Abraxis
    assumed approximately a 6% royalty on all U.S. sales, moving
    forward from the verdict, of
    ABRAXANE   

    brand drug, plus interest. The patent expired on
    January 25, 2011.

ABRAXIS
    SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT  

Abraxis, the members of the Abraxis board of directors and the
    Celgene Corporation are named as defendants in putative class
    action lawsuits brought by Abraxis stockholders challenging the
    Abraxis acquisition in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The
    plaintiffs in such actions assert claims for breaches of
    fiduciary duty arising out of the acquisition and allege that
    Abraxis  directors engaged in self-dealing and obtained for
    themselves personal benefits and failed to provide stockholders
    with material information relating to the acquisition. The
    plaintiffs also allege claims for aiding and abetting breaches
    of fiduciary duty against the Company and Abraxis.

On September 14, 2010, the parties reached an agreement in
    principle to settle the actions pursuant to the Memorandum of
    Understanding, or the MOU. Without admitting the validity of any
    allegations made in the actions,

113

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

or any liability with respect thereto, the defendants elected to
    settle the actions in order to avoid the cost, disruption and
    distraction of further litigation. Under the MOU, the defendants
    agreed, among other things, to make additional disclosures
    relating to the acquisition, and to provide the plaintiffs 
    counsel with limited discovery to confirm the fairness and
    adequacy of the settlement. Abraxis, on behalf of itself and for
    the benefit of the other defendants in the actions, also agreed
    to pay the plaintiffs  counsel $600,000 for their fees and
    expenses. Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against the
    Company and Abraxis relating to the Company s acquisition
    of Abraxis, except claims to enforce the settlement or properly
    perfected claims for appraisal in connection with the
    acquisition of Abraxis by the Company.

On November 15, 2010, the parties executed and filed a
    stipulation and settlement with the Court and plaintiffs filed a
    motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement.
    On January 26, 2011, the Court granted plaintiffs 
    motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement,
    certified the class for settlement purposes only and approved
    the form of notice of the settlement of the class action.

Major Customers:   The Company sells its
    products primarily through wholesale distributors and specialty
    pharmacies in the United States, which account for a large
    portion of the Company s total revenues. International
    sales are primarily made directly to hospitals, clinics and
    retail chains, many of which are government owned. In 2010, 2009
    and 2008, the following two customers accounted for more than

(1)  

Gross profit is computed by subtracting cost of goods sold
    (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) from net
    product sales. 

(2)  

The sum of the quarters may not equal the full year due to
    rounding. In addition, quarterly and full year basic and diluted
    earnings per share are calculated separately. 

The results of the ongoing
    ABRAXANE   

    Phase III study in NSCLC, or the NSCLC study, were
    presented at a major scientific congress in June 2010. These
    results indicated that the primary endpoint of overall response
    rate was met and that it achieved statistical significance. On
    January 10, 2011, the Company further announced that it had
    completed an interim analysis on the secondary endpoint for
    progression free survival, or PFS, for the NSCLC study. These
    interim PFS results, while not negative, were not statistically
    significant. The NSCLC approval, if achieved, would be based on
    the Special Protocol Assessment agreed upon with the FDA. The
    Special Protocol Assessment states that the trial must reach the
    primary endpoint of response rate, which has been met, as well
    as showing that the secondary endpoint of PFS is not negative
    or, trending in the wrong direction. The interim analysis did
    not show a negative trend for PFS, and the
    ABRAXANE   

    arm was no worse than the comparator arm. This reduces the
    probability that a payment will be made for Milestone
    Payment #1 under the CVR agreement that the Company entered
    into with the former shareholders of Abraxis (see Note 2).
    Should the final analysis of the PFS data, which is expected in
    the middle of 2011, not demonstrate a positive trend, then
    Milestone Payment #1 under the CVR agreement has a high
    probability of not being met. Milestone Payment #1 relates
    to the marketing of
    ABRAXANE   

    under a label that includes a PFS claim, but only if the
    foregoing milestone is achieved no later than the fifth
    anniversary of the acquisition of Abraxis. The market value of
    the publicly traded CVRs, which represents the fair value of the
    Company s liability for all potential payments under the
    CVR agreement, has therefore decreased from $212.0 million
    at December 31, 2010 to $101.7 million at
    February 10, 2011. In addition, the Company will adjust the
    value of the liability for the CVRs as of the end of its first
    quarter 2011, and at that time will consider the results of the
    interim analysis of PFS when it performs impairment testing on
    the IPR D asset acquired with the Abraxis transaction.

On February 23, 2011, the Company entered into an interest
    rate swap contract to convert a portion of its interest rate
    exposure from fixed rate to floating rate to more closely align
    interest expense with interest income received on its cash
    equivalent and investment balances. The floating rate is
    benchmarked to LIBOR. The swap is designated as a fair value
    hedge on the fixed-rate debt issue maturing October 2015. Since
    the specific terms and notional amount of the swap match those
    of the debt being hedged, it is assumed to be a highly effective
    hedge and all changes in fair value of the swaps will be
    recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact
    recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of
    this filing, the total notional amount of debt hedged with an
    interest rate swap is $125.0 million.

    AND PROCEDURES   

CONCLUSION
    REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND
    PROCEDURES  

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined in the Exchange Act
     Rules 13a-15(e) 
    and
     15d-15(e)) 
    (the  Exchange Act ). Based on the foregoing
    evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to our management (including our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

CHANGES
    IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

The acquisition of Abraxis on October 15, 2010 represents a
    material change in internal control over financial reporting
    since management s last assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company s internal controls over financial reporting
    which was as of September 30, 2010. The acquired Abraxis
    operations utilize separate information and accounting systems
    and processes and it was not possible to complete an evaluation
    and review of the internal controls over financial reporting
    since the acquisition was completed.

Management intends to complete its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for
    the acquired business within one year of the date of the
    acquisition.

With the exception of the Abraxis acquisition as noted above,
    there were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
    executive and principal financial officers and effected by our
    Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;
    (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In connection with the preparation of our annual consolidated
    financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework. Management s
    assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal
    control over financial reporting and testing of the operational
    effectiveness of those controls.

We acquired Abraxis BioScience, Inc. ( Abraxis )
    during 2010, and our management excluded from its assessment of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, Abraxis s internal
    control over financial reporting associated with total net
    assets of approximately $3.2 billion (of which
    approximately $2.6 billion represents goodwill and
    identifiable intangible assets which are included within the
    scope of the assessment) and total revenues of
    $88.5 million included in our consolidated financial
    statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Management intends to complete its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for
    the acquired business within one year of the date of the
    acquisition.

With the exception of the Abraxis acquisition as noted above,
    based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2010.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that
    audited our consolidated financial statements included in this
    report, has issued their report on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, a
    copy of which is included herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Celgene Corporation:

We have audited Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries 
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, or COSO. Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries 
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Celgene
    Corporation and subsidiaries  internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated
    Framework issued by COSO.

Celgene Corporation acquired Abraxis BioScience, Inc.
    ( Abraxis ) during 2010, and management excluded from
    its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, Abraxis s internal control over
    financial reporting associated with total net assets of
    approximately $3.2 billion (of which approximately
    $2.6 billion represents goodwill and identifiable
    intangible assets which are included within the scope of the
    assessment) and total revenues of $88.5 million included in
    the consolidated financial statements of Celgene Corporation as
    of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our audit of
    internal control over financial reporting of Celgene Corporation
    also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over
    financial reporting of Abraxis.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and
    stockholders  equity for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and our report
    dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements.
