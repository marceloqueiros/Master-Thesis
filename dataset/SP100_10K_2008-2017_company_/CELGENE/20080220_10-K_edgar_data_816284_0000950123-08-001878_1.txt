PART I  

ITEM 1.      

BUSINESS   

Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively
     we  or  our ) is a global integrated
    biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery,
    development and commercialization of innovative therapies
    designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory related
    diseases. Our primary commercial stage products are
    REVLIMID   
    (lenalidomide) and
    THALOMID   
    (thalidomide).
    REVLIMID   
    was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
    FDA, the European Commission, or EC, Swiss Agency for
    Therapeutic Products, or Swissmedic and Australian Therapeutic
    Goods Administration, for treatment in combination with
    dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at
    least one prior therapy. In addition,
    REVLIMID   
    was approved by the FDA and the Canadian Therapeutic Products
    Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent
    anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic
    syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic
    abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic
    abnormalities.
    THALOMID   
    was approved by the FDA for treatment in combination with
    dexamethasone of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
    and is also approved for the treatment and suppression of
    cutaneous manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL,
    an inflammatory complication of leprosy. We also sell
    ALKERAN   ,
    which we obtain through a supply and distribution agreement with
    GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, and
    FOCALIN  tm  ,
    which we sell exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. We
    continue to develop our international operations and expect them
    to provide a significant contribution to future financial
    results as our products obtain additional regulatory approval
    for sale in foreign markets. Other sources of revenue include
    royalties which we primarily receive from Novartis on its sales
    of the entire family of
    RITALIN   
    drugs and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  ,
    in addition to revenues from collaborative agreements and
    licensing fees. Our broad portfolio of drug candidates in our
    product pipeline includes
    IMiDs   
    compounds, which are proprietary to us and have demonstrated
    certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important
    properties. We believe that the catalysts for future growth
    include: continued success of
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   ;
    depth of our product pipeline; favorable clinical data reported
    at major medical conferences and in peer-reviewed publications;
    additional product approvals from regulatory agencies; continued
    international market expansion; successful integration of any
    future product or business acquisitions.

We are dedicated to innovative research and development designed
    to bring new therapies to market and are involved in research in
    several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary
    next-generation therapies, such as intracellular signaling,
    immunomodulation and placental stem cell research. The therapies
    (drugs and cell therapies) we develop are designed to treat
    life-threatening diseases or chronic debilitating conditions
    where patients are poorly served by current therapies. Building
    on our growing knowledge of the biology underlying hematological
    and solid tumor cancers and immune-inflammatory diseases, we are
    investing in a range of innovative therapeutic programs that are
    investigating ways to treat and chronically manage diseases by
    targeting the disease source through multiple mechanisms of
    action.

Our future growth and operating results will depend on continued
    acceptance of our currently marketed products, regulatory
    approvals of both new products and the expanded use of existing
    products, depth of our product pipeline and ability to
    commercialize these products, competition to our marketed
    products and challenges to our intellectual property. We will
    continue to expand our international infrastructure in
    anticipation of additional international regulatory approvals
    and commercialization of our products. See also Risk Factors
    contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, we reported revenue
    of $1.406 billion, net income of $226.4 million and
    diluted earnings per share of $0.54, representing increases of
    56.4%, 228.3% and 200.0%, respectively, compared to the year
    ended December 31, 2006. This increase primarily reflects
    the expanded use of
    REVLIMID   ,
    partly offset by increased operating expenses required to
    support our on-going research, commercial operations and
    continued expansion into international markets.

ACQUISITIONS  

In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., d/b/a
    Celgene Research San Diego, a privately held
    biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and
    development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease.

In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., which was a
    privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord
    blood banking business, developing technologies for the recovery
    of stem cells from human placental tissues following the
    completion of full-term, successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis
    d/b/a Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now operates as a
    wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation engaged in the
    research, recovery culture-expansion, preservation, development
    and distribution of placental stem cells as therapeutic agents.

In October 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of
    Penn T Limited, a UK-based global supplier of
    THALOMID   .
    This acquisition expanded our corporate capabilities and enabled
    us to control manufacturing for
    THALOMID   
    worldwide. Through supply contracts acquired in this purchase,
    we also increased our participation in the potential growth of
    THALOMID   
    revenues in key international markets.

In December 2006, we purchased an active pharmaceutical
    ingredient, or API, manufacturing facility from Siegfried Ltd.
    and Siegfried Dienste AG (together  Siegfried )
    located in Zofingen, Switzerland. The manufacturing facility has
    the capability to produce multiple drug substances and is being
    used to produce
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    API to supply global markets. The facility may also be used to
    produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates.
    This asset acquisition expanded our manufacturing capabilities
    and enabled us to control the production of
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    worldwide.

In November 2007, we announced the signing of a definitive
    merger agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Pharmion
    Corporation, or Pharmion. Under the terms of the merger
    agreement, we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of
    Pharmion common stock for $72.00 per share payable in a
    combination of cash and shares of Celgene common stock. The
    transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of
    Directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing
    conditions including the approval of the acquisition by Pharmion
    stockholders and receipt of antitrust clearances. The
     Hart-Scott-Rodino 
    Act, or HSR, thirty day waiting period has expired without the
    United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requesting
    additional information with regard to the merger. In addition,
    the Bundeskartellamt, Germany s Federal Cartel Office in
    charge of reviewing the antitrust aspects of mergers and
    acquisitions, has cleared Celgene s pending acquisition of
    Pharmion. On February 5, 2008 the
     Form S-4 
    relating to the merger of Pharmion and Celgene was declared
    effective by the United States Securities and Exchange
    Commission, or SEC. The merger is expected to be completed in
    March 2008. Refer to Note 2  Proposed Merger with
    Pharmion Corporation  contained within the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

COMMERCIAL
    STAGE PRODUCTS:  

REVLIMID      
     (lenalidomide):    REVLIMID   
    is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved by the FDA, the EC,
    Swissmedic, and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration
    for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for patients
    with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior
    therapy.
    REVLIMID   
    is also approved by the FDA and Canadian Therapeutic Products
    Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent
    anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, associated with a
    deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional
    cytogenetic abnormalities.
    REVLIMID   
    is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted
    pharmacies under the
    RevAssist   
    program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution
    program tailored specifically to help ensure, to the maximum
    extent possible, the safe use of
    REVLIMID   
    and is being distributed in additional countries where approval
    has been obtained as pricing, reimbursement and details of
    controlled distribution in each market are determined.

REVLIMID   
    continues to be evaluated in numerous clinical trials worldwide
    either alone or in combination with one or more other therapies
    in the treatment of a broad range of hematological malignancies,
    including multiple myeloma, MDS, non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, or
    NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, other cancers and
    other diseases.

A Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, seeking approval
    to market
    REVLIMID   
    for treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to
    low-or-intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated
    with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without
    additional cytogenetic abnormalities was evaluated by the
    European Medicines Agency s, or EMEA, Committee for
    Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, and a negative
    opinion was issued in January 2008. The CHMP concluded that
    lenalidomide is efficacious in patients suffering from deletion
    5q MDS. However, based on information available to the CHMP from
    the uncontrolled, open-label, 148-patient Phase II study
    (MDS-003), the CHMP was not convinced the data were sufficient
    to assure safety. We intend to apply for a re-examination of the
    CHMP opinion in accordance with relevant EMEA procedures. Other
    international regulatory initiatives include MAAs currently
    being evaluated in New Zealand and Israel.

In April 2007, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group reported
    that its Data Monitoring Committee s review of preliminary
    results from a large, randomized clinical trial for patients
    with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma found that the use of a
    lower-dose of dexamethasone in combination with
    REVLIMID   
    suggests survival advantage for patients when compared to the
    higher, standard-dose of dexamethasone that is used in
    combination with
    REVLIMID   
    to treat the disease. These results were also presented at the
    June 2007 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology medical
    conference and updated at the December 2007 annual American
    Society of Hematology meeting. The regulatory utility of these
    findings will be discussed with the FDA.

THALOMID      
     (thalidomide):    THALOMID   
    was approved by the FDA in May 2006 for use in combination with
    dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed
    multiple myeloma and in July 1998 for the treatment of acute
    cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum
    leprosum, or ENL, and as maintenance therapy for prevention and
    suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of ENL recurrence.

THALOMID   
    is distributed under our   System for Thalidomide
    Education and Prescribing Safety ,  or
    S.T.E.P.S.   ,
    program which we developed and is a proprietary strategic
    comprehensive education and risk-management distribution program
    with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate
    distribution and use of
    THALOMID   .
    Among other things,
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    requires prescribers, patients and dispensing pharmacies to
    participate in a registry and an order cannot be filled unless
    the physicians, patients and pharmacies have been registered,
    trained and meet all qualification criteria.

ALKERAN   
    (melphalan):    ALKERAN   
    is licensed from GSK, and sold under the Celgene label.
    ALKERAN   
    was approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple
    myeloma and of carcinoma of the ovary. Under terms of the
    licensing agreement, we purchase
    ALKERAN   
    tablets and
    ALKERAN   
    for injection from GSK and distribute the products in the United
    States. The agreement, which has been extended through
    March 31, 2009, requires us to purchase certain minimum
    quantities of
    ALKERAN   
    each year under a take-or-pay arrangement.

RITALIN      
     Family of Drugs:    In April 2000, we
    licensed to Novartis the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) to
    FOCALIN  tm  
    and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  ,
    which are approved for the treatment of attention deficit
    hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. We retained the rights to these
    products for the treatment of oncology-related disorders. We
    sell
    FOCALIN  tm  
    exclusively to Novartis and also supply them with FOCALIN
    XR  tm  ,
    for which we receive a royalty.

FOCALIN  tm  
    is formulated by isolating the active d-isomer of
    methylphenidate and contains only the more active isomer
    responsible for the effective management of the symptoms of
    ADHD.
    FOCALIN  tm  
    provides favorable tolerability and dosing flexibility at half
    the dose of
    RITALIN   .

PRECLINICAL
    AND CLINICAL   STAGE PIPELINE:  

Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug
    candidates, in addition to our cell therapies, is highlighted by
    multiple classes of small molecule, orally administered
    therapeutic agents designed to selectively regulate
    disease-associated genes and proteins. The product candidates in
    our pipeline are at various

3

Table of Contents   

stages of preclinical and clinical development. Successful
    results in preclinical or Phase I/II clinical studies may not be
    an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of
    a drug or product candidate.

Phase
    I Clinical Trials   

If the FDA allows a request to initiate clinical investigations
    of a new drug or product candidate to become effective, Phase I
    human clinical trials can begin. These tests usually involve
    between 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or patients. The tests study
    a drug s safety profile, and may include preliminary
    determination of a drug or product candidate s safe dosage
    range. The Phase I clinical studies also determine how a drug is
    absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and
    the duration of its action.

Phase II
    Clinical Trials   

In Phase II clinical trials, studies are conducted on a
    limited number of patients with the targeted disease. An initial
    evaluation of the drug s effectiveness on patients is
    performed and additional information on the drug s safety
    and dosage range is obtained.

Phase III
    Clinical Trials   

This phase typically includes controlled multi-center trials and
    involves a larger target patient population to ensure that study
    results are statistically significant. During the Phase III
    clinical trials, physicians monitor patients to determine
    efficacy and to gather further information on safety.

IMiDs   :    IMiDs   
    compounds are proprietary novel small molecule, orally available
    compounds that modulate the immune system and other biologically
    important targets through multiple mechanisms of action. We have
    marketed
    REVLIMID   
    and have advanced two other
    IMiDs   
    compounds into clinical development, CC-4047 and CC-11006.
    Additional compounds, including CC-10015, are in preclinical
    development.

Our
    IMiDs   
    compounds are covered by an extensive and comprehensive
    intellectual property estate of U.S. and foreign-issued
    patents and pending patent applications including
    composition-of-matter, use and other patents and patent
    applications.

CC-4047:    CC-4047 (pomalidomide) is one
    of the most potent
    IMiDs   
    compounds that we are developing. We opened our investigational
    new drug, or IND, application to evaluate CC-4047 in a
    U.S. proof-of-principle study in sickle cell anemia. We are
    also evaluating CC-4047 for treatment in other diseases
    including myelofibrosis, multiple myeloma and solid tumor
    cancers.

CC-11006:    CC-11006 is another molecule
    with activities distinct from those of
    REVLIMID   
    and CC-4047. Following successful completion of Phase I human
    clinical trials, we are currently evaluating conditions where
    this profile will have best therapeutic application including an
    ongoing Phase I clinical trial in MDS.

ORAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS:    In May
    2007, we announced plans to advance the development of leading
    oral anti-inflammatory candidates across a broad range of
    inflammatory diseases. Our oral PDE-4 inhibitor, CC-10004
    (apremilast), is a member of a proprietary pipeline of novel
    small molecules with anti-inflammatory activities that impede
    the production of multiple proinflammatory mediators by
    inhibiting PDE-4 resulting in reductions in TNF-  as well
    as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-17 and IL-23, interferon-gamma,
    leukotrienes and nitric oxide synthase. Apremilast is our lead
    investigational drug in this class of anti-inflammatory
    compounds. Based on results from proof-of-mechanism studies, we
    are accelerating clinical and regulatory strategies for
    apremilast in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as
    embarking on exploratory clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis
    and additional rheumatic, dermatologic and inflammatory diseases
    to determine the potential of apremilast across a broad range of
    debilitating inflammatory diseases. We believe that our second
    oral PDE-4 inhibitor, CC-11050, which has completed Phase I
    trials, will also prove to be effective in a number of
    inflammatory conditions and is moving forward with its
    development.

KINASE INHIBITORS:    We have generated
    valuable intellectual property in the identification of kinases
    that regulate pathways critical in inflammation and oncology.
    Our kinase inhibitor platform includes inhibitors

of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK, pathway, and inhibitors
    of the NFkB pathway. The JNK inhibitor, CC-401, has successfully
    completed a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers and in acute
    myelogenous leukemia, or AML, patients to determine safety and
    tolerability. No further studies are planned at this time as we
    intend to advance other JNK inhibitors. An investigational new
    drug application was filed for CC-930 on December 18, 2007
    and the application was approved in January 2008. Phase I
    testing is scheduled to begin in February 2008.

LIGASE INHIBITORS:    Our work has defined
    ubiquitin ligases that regulate the degradation of intracellular
    proteins. These ligases, as a class of targets, have broad
    potential for drug discovery in oncology. By identifying drug
    targets and compounds that regulate ligase pathways, we are
    addressing the potential to develop an important new class of
    anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory therapeutics.

PLEIOTROPIC PATHWAY MODIFIERS:    Based
    upon our observations about the effect of therapeutics to modify
    multiple intracellular signaling pathways in distinct cell
    types, we have identified a new class of molecules that impact
    activity of several key pathways of therapeutic relevance. The
    first of these, CC-16057, has moved into preclinical development
    for inflammatory conditions.

STEM CELLS:    At Celgene Cellular
    Therapeutics, or CCT, we are researching stem cells derived from
    the human placenta as well as from the umbilical cord. CCT is
    our state-of-the-art research and development division dedicated
    to fulfilling the promise of cellular technologies by developing
    cutting-edge products and therapies that will significantly
    benefit patients. Our goal is to develop proprietary cell
    therapy products for the treatment of unmet medical needs.

Stem cell based therapies offer the potential to provide
    disease-modifying outcomes for serious diseases which today lack
    adequate therapy. We have developed proprietary technology for
    collecting, processing, and storing placental stem cells with
    potentially broad therapeutic applications in cancer,
    auto-immune diseases, including Crohn s disease and
    multiple sclerosis, neurological disorders including stroke and
    ALS, graft-versus-host disease and other immunological and
    rheumatilogical disorders. Our studies of the placenta indicate
    that it is a rich source of potential products with biological
    activity and therapeutic promise. Our lead product, PDA-001, is
    completing preclinical studies. We plan to submit our first IND
    in the second half of 2008.

In December 2006, CCT submitted an IND for our human placental
    derived stem cell, or HPDSC, product. We also maintain an IND
    with the FDA for a trial with cord blood in sickle cell anemia.
    Additional preclinical research to define further the potential
    of placental-derived stem cells and to characterize other
    placental-derived products is continuing.

PATENTS
    AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY  

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our
    business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our
    inventions, and also to rely upon trade secrets, know-how,
    continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities
    to develop and maintain our competitive position.

We own or have exclusively licensed at least 155 issued
    U.S. patents and at least 285 additional U.S. patent
    applications are pending. While we have a policy to seek
    worldwide patent protection for our inventions, we have foreign
    patent rights corresponding to most of our U.S. patents.
    Further, although
    THALOMID   
    is approved for use associated with ENL, we do not have patent
    protection relating to the use of
    THALOMID   
    to treat ENL.

In August 2001, we entered into an agreement, termed the
     New Thalidomide Agreement,  with EntreMed, Inc.,
    Children s Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC, and
    Bioventure Investments, KFT relating to patents and patent
    applications owned by CMCC, which agreement superceded several
    agreements already

6

Table of Contents   

in place between CMCC, EntreMed and us. Pursuant to the New
    Thalidomide Agreement, CMCC directly granted to us an exclusive
    worldwide license under the relevant patents and patent
    applications relating to thalidomide. Several U.S. patents
    have been issued to CMCC in this patent family and certain of
    these patents expire in 2013 and 2014. Corresponding foreign
    patent applications and additional U.S. patent applications
    are still pending.

In addition to the New Thalidomide Agreement, we entered into an
    agreement, entitled the  New Analog Agreement,  with
    CMCC and EntreMed in December 2002, pursuant to which we have
    been granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain CMCC
    patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide analogs.
    The New Analog Agreement was executed in connection with the
    settlement of certain pending litigation by and among us,
    EntreMed and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating
    to the allowance of certain CMCC patent applications covering
    thalidomide analogs. These patent applications had been licensed
    exclusively to EntreMed in the field of thalidomide analogs. In
    conjunction with the settlement of these suits, we acquired
    equity securities in EntreMed, and EntreMed terminated its
    license agreements with CMCC relating to thalidomide analogs. In
    turn, under the New Analog Agreement, CMCC exclusively licensed
    to Celgene these patents and patent applications, which relate
    to analogs, metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of
    thalidomide, and stereoisomers thereof. Under the New Analog
    Agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain milestones
    and other obligations, including those relating to
    REVLIMID   
    approval and sales.

The New Analog Agreement grants us control over the prosecution
    and maintenance of the licensed thalidomide analog patent
    rights. The New Analog Agreement also granted us an option to
    inventions in the field of thalidomide analogs that may be
    developed at CMCC in the laboratory of Dr. Robert
    D Amato, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separate
    Sponsored Research Agreement negotiated between CMCC and us.

Our research led us to seek patent protection for molecular
    targets and drug discovery technologies, as well as therapeutic
    and diagnostic products and processes. More specifically,
    proprietary technology has been developed for use in molecular
    target discovery, the identification of regulatory pathways in
    cells, assay design and the discovery and development of
    pharmaceutical product candidates. As of December 2007, included
    in those inventions described above, we owned, in whole or in
    part, 49 issued U.S. patents and approximately
    57 U.S. pending patent applications, including pending
    provisional applications. An increasing percentage of our
    San Diego subsidiary s recent patent applications have
    been related to potential product candidates or compounds. It
    also holds licenses to U.S. patents and U.S. patent
    applications, some of which are licensed exclusively or
     sub-licensed 
    to third parties in connection with sponsored or collaborative
    research relationships.

CCT, our cellular therapeutics subsidiary, seeks patent
    protection for the collection, processing, composition,
    formulation and uses of mammalian placental and umbilical cord
    tissue and placental and umbilical cord stem cells, as well as
    cells and biomaterials derived from the placenta. As of December
    2007, CCT owned, in whole or in part, five U.S. patents,
    and more than 48 U.S. patent applications, including
    pending provisional applications, and holds licenses to
    U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications, including
    certain patents and patent applications related to cord blood
    collection and storage.

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and
    enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to
    technology owned by third parties where it is necessary to
    conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary
    rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology firms, including ours, can be uncertain and
    involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the
    coverage sought in a patent application can be significantly
    reduced before the patent is issued.

Consequently, we do not know whether any of our owned or
    licensed pending patent applications, which have not already
    been allowed, will result in the issuance of patents or, if any
    patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by
    third-party patent rights, whether they will provide significant
    proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they
    will be circumvented, opposed or infringed by others. Finally,
    we are also aware of third-party U.S. patents that relate
    to the use of certain stem cell technologies and cannot
    guarantee that our patents or pending applications will not be
    involved in, or be defeated as a result of,

7

Table of Contents   

opposition proceedings before a foreign patent office or any
    interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and
    Trademark Office.

With respect to patents and patent applications we have
    licensed-in, there can be no assurance that additional patents
    will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have
    licensed patent rights, either with respect to thalidomide or
    thalidomide analogs, or that, if any new patents are issued,
    such patents will not be opposed, challenged, invalidated,
    infringed or dominated or provide us with significant
    proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Moreover, there
    can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed patents
    will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial
    advantage. Nor can we guarantee that these licensed patents will
    not be either infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others,
    or that the relevant agreements will not be terminated. Any
    termination of the licenses granted to Celgene by CMCC could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Because 1) patent applications filed in the United States
    on or before November 28, 2000 are maintained in secrecy
    until patents issue, 2) patent applications filed in the
    U.S. on or after November 29, 2000 are not published
    until approximately 18 months after their earliest claimed
    priority date and 3) publication of discoveries in the
    scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual
    discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, or our licensors,
    were the first to make the inventions covered by each of the
    issued patents or pending patent applications or that we, or our
    licensors, were the first to file patent applications for such
    inventions. In the event a third party has also filed a patent
    for any of our inventions, we, or our licensors, may have to
    participate in interference proceedings before the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of
    invention, which could result in the loss of a U.S. patent
    or loss of any opportunity to secure U.S. patent protection
    for the invention. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to
    us, such interference proceedings could result in substantial
    cost to us.

We are aware of U.S. patents that have been issued to third
    parties claiming subject matter relating to the NF B
    pathway, including U.S. patents which could overlap with
    technology claimed in some of our owned or licensed NF B
    patents or patent applications, and a U.S. patent that has
    been asserted against certain pharmaceutical companies. With
    respect to those patents that overlap with our applications, we
    believe that one or more interference proceedings may be
    initiated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to
    determine priority of invention for this subject matter. While
    we cannot predict the outcome of any such proceedings, in the
    event we do not prevail, we believe that we can use alternative
    methods for our NF B drug discovery program for which we
    have issued U.S. patents that are not claimed by the
    subject matter of the third-party patents. We are also aware of
    third-party U.S patents that relate to the use of certain
    TNF-  inhibitors to treat inflammation or conditions such
    as asthma.

We may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing
    patents or we may be required to obtain licenses to such
    patents. However, we do not know whether such licenses will be
    available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
    Prosecution of patent applications and litigation to establish
    the validity and scope of patents, to assert patent infringement
    claims against others and to defend against patent infringement
    claims by others can be expensive and time-consuming. There can
    be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our
    owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third
    parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge
    will determine that such patent claims are valid and
    enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation could cause
    us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated
    by such patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on
    our business. If a third party is found to have rights covering
    products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease
    using the products or processes covered by the disputed rights,
    subject to significant liabilities to such third party
     and/or  be
    required to license technologies from such third party. Also,
    different countries have different procedures for obtaining
    patents, and patents issued by different countries provide
    different degrees of protection against the use of a patented
    invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that
    the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an
    invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of
    patents covering the same invention or that any judicial
    interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the
    claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the
    judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued
    in another country. Competitors may choose to file oppositions
    to patent applications, which have been deemed allowable by
    foreign patent examiners. Furthermore, even if our owned or
    licensed patents are determined to be valid and

8

Table of Contents   

enforceable, there can be no assurance that competitors will not
    be able to design around such patents and compete with us using
    the resulting alternative technology. Additionally, for these
    same reasons, we cannot be sure that patents of a broader scope
    than ours may be issued and thereby create freedom to operate
    issues. If this occurs we may need to reevaluate pursuing such
    technology, which is dominated by others  patent rights, or
    alternatively, seek a license to practice our own invention,
    whether or not patented.

We also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret
    technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality
    agreements with our collaborative partners, employees,
    consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored
    researchers and other advisors. There can be no assurance that
    these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will
    not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any
    such breach or that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and
    technological advances will not otherwise become known to
    others. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite
    precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain
    access to our proprietary technology or that such technology
    will not be found to be non-proprietary or not a trade secret.

GOVERNMENTAL
    REGULATION  

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and
    other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and
    marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and
    development activities. Most, if not all, of our therapeutic
    products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies
    prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic
    products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and
    clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by
    the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the
    United States, various federal and in some cases state statutes
    and regulations also govern or impact upon the manufacturing,
    testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling, storage,
    record-keeping and marketing of such products. The lengthy
    process of seeking required approvals, and the continuing need
    for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require
    the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval,
    if and when obtained, may be limited in scope which may
    significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may
    be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as their
    manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review and discovery of
    previously unknown problems with such products or the
    manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their
    production may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale
    or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure by
    us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or
    licensees to obtain or maintain, or any delay in obtaining,
    regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our
    products and our ability to receive product revenue, license
    revenue or profit sharing payments.

The activities required before a product may be marketed in the
    United States begin with preclinical testing not involving human
    subjects. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a
    product candidate s chemistry and its biological activities
    and the conduct of animal studies to assess the potential safety
    and efficacy of a product candidate and its formulations. The
    results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of
    an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must be
    reviewed by the FDA primarily for safety considerations before
    proposed clinical trials in humans can begin.

Typically, clinical trials involve a three-phase process as
    previously described. In some cases, further studies (Phase
    IV) are required as a condition for new drug application,
    or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, approval, to
    provide additional information concerning the drug or product.
    The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials,
    and reports of all adverse events must be made to the agency
    before drug approval. After approval, we have ongoing reporting
    obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the
    drug, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected
    adverse events. Additionally, we may have limited control over
    studies conducted with our proprietary compounds or biologics if
    such studies are performed by others (e.g., cooperative groups
    and the like).

The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are
    submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA for evaluation to
    determine if the product is sufficiently safe and effective for
    approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA
    or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional
    information or deny the application if it determines that the
    application does not satisfy its

9

Table of Contents   

regulatory approval criteria. When an NDA or BLA is approved,
    the NDA or BLA holder must a) employ a system for obtaining
    reports of experience and side effects associated with the drug
    and make appropriate submissions to the FDA and b) timely
    advise the FDA if any marketed product fails to adhere to
    specifications established by the NDA or BLA internal
    manufacturing procedures.

Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the
    FDA designate a drug intended to treat a  rare disease or
    condition  as an  orphan drug . The term
     orphan drug  can refer to either a drug or biologic.
    A rare disease or condition is defined as one which affects less
    than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects
    more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of
    developing and making available the product is not expected to
    be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
    Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated
    as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of
    that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive
    marketing rights in the United States for such drug or product
    containing the active ingredient for the same indication unless
    the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient
    quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the
    disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the
    approved indication and does not prevent another company from
    seeking approval of other labeled indications. The period of
    orphan exclusivity is concurrent with any patent exclusivity
    that relates to the drug or biologic. Orphan drugs may also be
    eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated
    with the drug s development. Possible amendment of the
    Orphan Drug Act by the U.S. Congress and possible
    reinterpretation by the FDA has been discussed by regulators and
    legislators. FDA regulations reflecting certain definitions,
    limitations and procedures for orphan drugs initially went into
    effect in January 1993 and were amended in certain respects in
    1998. Therefore, there is no assurance as to the precise scope
    of protection that may be afforded by orphan drug status in the
    future or that the current level of exclusivity and tax credits
    will remain in effect. Moreover, even if we have an orphan drug
    designation for a particular use of a drug, there can be no
    assurance that another company also holding orphan drug
    designation will not receive approval prior to us for the same
    indication. If that were to happen, our applications for that
    indication could not be approved until the competing
    company s seven-year period of exclusivity expired. Even if
    we are the first to obtain approval for the orphan drug
    indication, there are certain circumstances under which a
    competing product may be approved for the same indication during
    our seven-year period of exclusivity. First, particularly in the
    case of large molecule drugs or biologics, a question can be
    raised whether the competing product is really the  same
    drug  as that which was approved. In addition, even in
    cases in which two products appear to be the same drug, the
    agency may approve the second product based on a showing of
    clinical superiority compared to the first product.
    REVLIMID   
    has been granted orphan medicinal product designation by the EC
    for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia following the
    favorable opinion of the EMEA s Committee for Orphan
    Medicinal Products.

Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement
    that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and
    manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDA s
    current Good Manufacturing Practice, cGMP, regulations (which
    are regulations established by the FDA governing the
    manufacture, processing, packing, storage and testing of drugs
    and biologics intended for human use). In complying with cGMP,
    manufacturers must devote extensive time, money and effort in
    the area of production and quality control and quality assurance
    to maintain full technical compliance. Manufacturing facilities
    and company records are subject to periodic inspections by the
    FDA to ensure compliance. If a manufacturing facility is not in
    substantial compliance with these requirements, regulatory
    enforcement action may be taken by the FDA, which may include
    seeking an injunction against shipment of products from the
    facility and recall of products previously shipped from the
    facility.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act, products covered by approved NDAs or supplemental
    NDAs may be protected by periods of patent
     and/or 
    non-patent exclusivity. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA
    is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an
    abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Further, NDAs submitted under
    505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act may not reference
    data contained in the NDA for a product protected by an
    effective and unexpired exclusivity. ANDAs and 505(b)(2)
    applications are generally less burdensome than full NDAs in
    that, in lieu of new clinical data, the applications rely in
    whole, or in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings of the
    referenced approved drug in conjunction with bridging data,
    typically bioequivalence data. Upon the expiration

10

Table of Contents   

of the applicable exclusivities, through passage of time or
    successful legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective approval
    of an ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a
    previously protected NDA in a 505(b)(2) application. Depending
    upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities, any such
    approval could be limited to certain formulations
     and/or 
    indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding
    exclusivities. While the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act provides
    for ANDA and 505(b)(2) abbreviated approval pathways for drugs
    submitted as NDAs and approved under section 505 of the
    Act, there are no similar provisions for biologics submitted as
    BLAs and approved under the Public Health Service, or PHS, Act.
    That is, there is currently no abbreviated application that
    would permit approval of a generic or  follow-on 
    biologic based on the Agency s earlier approval of another
    manufacturer s application under section 351 of the
    PHS Act.

Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements
    can result in enforcement actions such as warning letters,
    recalls or adverse publicity issued by the FDA or in legal
    actions such as seizures, injunctions, fines based on the
    equitable remedy of disgorgement, restitution and criminal
    prosecution.

Approval procedures similar to those in the United States must
    be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the
    market for our products before any such product can be
    commercialized in those countries. The approval procedure and
    the time required for approval vary from country to country and
    may involve additional testing. There can be no assurance that
    approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all. In
    addition, regulatory approval of drug and biologics pricing is
    required in most countries other than the United States. There
    can be no assurance that the resulting pricing of our products
    would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.

COMPETITION  

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in which we
    compete are each highly competitive. Our competitors include
    major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which
    have considerably greater financial, scientific, technical and
    marketing resources than us. We also experience competition in
    the development of our products and processes from universities
    and other research institutions and, in some instances, compete
    with others in acquiring technology from such sources.

Competition in the pharmaceutical industry, and specifically in
    the oncology and immune-inflammatory areas being addressed by
    us, is particularly intense. Numerous pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology and generic companies have extensive anti-cancer
    and anti-inflammatory drug discovery, development and commercial
    resources. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Amgen Inc., Genentech,
    Inc., Sanofi-Aventis SA., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca PLC., Eli
    Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd, Millennium
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Biogen Idec Inc., Merck
    and Co., Inc., Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer Inc. are among
    some of the companies researching and developing new compounds
    in the oncology, inflammation and immunology fields.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have undergone,
    and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant
    technological change. Also, consolidation and competition are
    expected to intensify as technical advances in each field are
    achieved and become more widely known. In order to compete
    effectively, we will be required to continually upgrade and
    expand our scientific expertise and technology, identify and
    retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and
    commercially viable opportunities.

Our competition will be determined in part by the indications
    and geographic markets for which our products are developed and
    ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. An important
    factor in competition will be the timing of market introduction
    of our or our competitors  products. Accordingly, the
    relative speed with which we can develop products, complete
    clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, receive
    pricing and reimbursement in certain markets and supply
    commercial quantities of products to the market are expected to
    be important competitive factors. Competition among products
    approved for sale will be based, among other things, on product
    efficacy, safety, convenience, reliability, availability, price,
    third-party reimbursement and patent and non-patent exclusivity.

SIGNIFICANT
    ALLIANCES  

From time to time we enter into strategic alliances with third
    parties whereby we either grant rights to certain of our
    compounds in exchange for rights to receive payments, or acquire
    rights to compounds owned by other pharmaceutical or
    biotechnology companies in exchange for obligations to make
    payments to the partnering companies. Payments either to or from
    third parties may be in the form of upfront payments, milestone
    payments contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined
    criteria
     and/or 
    research and development funding. Under these arrangements, one
    of the parties may also purchase product and pay royalties on
    product sales. The following are our most significant alliances:

NOVARTIS:    In April 2000, we entered
    into a development and license agreement with Novartis in which
    we granted to Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding
    Canada) to further develop and market
    FOCALIN  tm  
    and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  ,
    the extended release drug formulation ( d-methylphenidate, or
    d-MPH ). We have retained the exclusive commercial rights to
    FOCALIN  tm  
    IR and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    for oncology-related disorders. We also granted Novartis rights
    to all of our related intellectual property and patents,
    including new formulations of the currently marketed
    RITALIN   .
    Under the agreement, we have received upfront and regulatory
    achievement milestone payments totaling $55.0 million
    through December 31, 2007 and are entitled to additional
    payments upon attainment of certain other milestone events. We
    also sell
    FOCALIN  tm  
    to Novartis and receive royalties on all of Novartis  sales
    of FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    and
    RITALIN   
    family of ADHD-related products.

PHARMION:    In November 2001, we licensed
    to Pharmion Corporation exclusive rights relating to the
    development and commercial use of our intellectual property
    covering thalidomide and
    S.T.E.P.S   .
    Under the terms of the agreement, as amended in December 2004,
    we receive royalties of 8% of Pharmion s net thalidomide
    sales in countries where Pharmion has received regulatory
    approval and
    S.T.E.P.S   
    licensing fees of 8% of net sales in all other licensed
    territories. In December 2004, following our acquisition of Penn
    T Limited in which, among other things, we acquired a product
    supply agreement to exclusively supply Pharmion with
    thalidomide, we entered into an amended thalidomide supply
    agreement whereby in exchange for a reduction in Pharmion s
    purchase price to 15.5% of its net sales of thalidomide, we
    received a one-time payment of $77.0 million. Pursuant to a
    separate December 2004 agreement, we also received a one-time
    payment of $3.0 million in return for granting license
    rights to Pharmion to develop and market thalidomide in
    additional territories and eliminating certain of our license
    termination rights. Under the agreements, as amended, the
    territory licensed to Pharmion is for all countries other than
    the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and China, with the
    exception of Hong Kong. The agreements with Pharmion terminate
    upon the ten-year anniversary following receipt of the first
    regulatory approval for thalidomide in the United Kingdom.

To support the further clinical development of thalidomide,
    Pharmion has also provided research funding under various
    agreements of approximately $16.0 million through
    December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, we held 1,939,598 shares of
    Pharmion common stock received in connection with the conversion
    of a five-year Senior Convertible Promissory Note and the
    exercise of warrants purchased in April 2003 under a Securities
    Purchase Agreement and the exercise of warrants received in
    connection with the November 2001 thalidomide and
    S.T.E.P.S   
    license agreement.

On November 18, 2007, we entered into a merger agreement
    with Pharmion under which Pharmion will be acquired and become a
    wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. The transaction will be
    accounted for as a purchase and we anticipate that the
    transaction will close in March 2008, subject to customary
    closing conditions including the approval of the acquisition by
    Pharmion stockholders. Refer to Note 2  Proposed
    Merger with Pharmion Corporation  contained within the
    consolidated financial statements for additional information.

GLAXOSMITHKLINE:    In March 2003, we
    entered into a supply and distribution agreement with GSK to
    distribute, promote and sell
    ALKERAN   
    ( melphalan ), a therapy approved by the FDA for the
    palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the
    ovary. Under the terms of the agreement, we purchase
    ALKERAN   
    tablets and
    ALKERAN   
    for injection from GSK and distribute the products in the United
    States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires us to
    purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a

12

Table of Contents   

take-or-pay 
    arrangement. The agreement has been extended through
    March 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining
    minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled
    $38.2 million, including $30.5 million in 2008 and
    $7.7 million in 2009.

MANUFACTURING  

We own and operate an FDA approved active pharmaceutical
    ingredient, or API, manufacturing facility in Zofingen,
    Switzerland. The API facility is used to produce
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    API. We have contracted with third party manufacturing service
    providers in order to provide backup manufacturing capabilities.
    These manufacturing service providers manufacture API in
    accordance with our specifications and are required to meet the
    FDA s and foreign regulatory authorities  cGMP
    regulations and guidelines. Our backup API manufacturing service
    providers are Aptuit Inc. UK (previously Evotec) with respect to
    REVLIMID   
    and Aptuit Inc. with respect to
    THALOMID   .

We have constructed a drug product manufacturing facility in
    Neuchatel, Switzerland to perform formulation, encapsulation,
    packaging, warehousing and distribution, and expect European and
    FDA approval in 2008. We maintain backup FDA drug product
    manufacturing service providers for the manufacture of
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   .
    These drug product manufacturing service providers include Penn
    Pharmaceutical Ltd, Institute of Drug Technology Australia Ltd
    and OSG Norwich Pharmaceuticals. Our packaging service providers
    include Sharp Corporation for worldwide packaging, Norwich
    Pharmaceuticals and Cimex AG for US packaging and non US
    packaging respectively.

The API for
    FOCALIN  tm  
    and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc.
    and Siegfried USA Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer,
    Mikart, Inc., for the tabletting and packaging of
    FOCALIN  tm  
    finished product.

CCT currently operates an FDA compliant facility for the
    recovery and storage of cordblood and placental stem cells for
    LifeBank USA. We are also implementing in-house capability for
    production of culture expanded placenta derived stem cells under
    GMP, to supply clinical studies of PDA001 and other future stem
    cell products.

INTERNATIONAL
    OPERATIONS  

Our international headquarters are located in Neuchatel,
    Switzerland and in 2007, we completed construction of a drug
    product manufacturing facility to perform formulation,
    encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution. We
    purchased an API manufacturing facility located in Zofingen,
    Switzerland which has the capability to produce multiple drug
    substances, expanding our global commercial manufacturing
    capabilities. We continue to expand our international
    regulatory, clinical and commercial infrastructure in various
    parts of the world.
    REVLIMID   
    has been granted approval by the EC, Swissmedic and Australian
    Therapeutic Goods Administration as a treatment for multiple
    myeloma who received at least one prior therapy.
    REVLIMID   
    has also been approved by the Canadian Therapeutic Products
    Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent
    anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, associated with a
    deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional
    cytogenetic abnormalities.

We granted Pharmion Corporation a license to expand the
    THALOMID   
    franchise in certain parts of the world, accelerating the
    establishment of
    THALOMID   
    as an important therapy in the international markets. In October
    2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, a supplier of
    THALOMID   .
    This acquisition has enabled us to manage the manufacturing for
    THALOMID   
    worldwide.

SALES AND
    COMMERCIALIZATION  

We have a global pharmaceutical commercial organization that has
    considerable experience in the pharmaceutical industry, and many
    of our employees have experience with oncological and
    immunological products. We will continue to expand our sales and
    commercialization group to support products we develop to treat
    oncological and immunological diseases. We intend to market and
    sell the products we develop for indications with accessible
    patient populations. For products with indications involving
    larger patient

13

Table of Contents   

populations, we may partner with other pharmaceutical companies.
    In addition, we are positioned to accelerate the expansion of
    these sales and marketing resources as appropriate to take
    advantage of product in-licensing and product acquisition
    opportunities.

EMPLOYEES  

As of December 31, 2007, we had 1,685 full-time
    employees, 921 of whom were engaged primarily in research and
    development activities, 428 who were engaged in sales and
    commercialization activities and the remainder of which were
    engaged in executive and general and administrative activities.
    The number of international full-time employees included above
    has grown to 436 as of December 31, 2007. We also employ a
    number of part-time employees and maintain consulting
    arrangements with a number of researchers at various
    universities and other research institutions in Europe and the
    United States.

forward-looking statements in this report, whether as a result
    of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or
    otherwise.

Item 1A.      

RISK
    FACTORS   

We may
    experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating
    results.   

We have historically experienced, and may continue to
    experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating
    results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many
    of which are outside our control, and may result in volatility
    of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many
    factors, including:

demand for our products;

pricing decisions, and those of our competitors, including
    decisions to increase or decrease prices;

regulatory approvals for our products;

timing and levels of spending for research and development;
    sales and marketing;

timing and levels of reimbursement from third-party payors for
    our products;

timing and market acceptance of new product introductions by us
     and/or 
    competitors;

development or expansion of business infrastructure in new
    clinical and geographic markets;

acquisition of new products and companies;

tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;

timing and recognition of certain research and development
    milestones and license fees;

ability to control our costs; and

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

If we
    are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing our products,
    our business, financial condition, results of operations and
    liquidity could be materially adversely affected which could
    have a negative impact on the value of our
    securities.   

Many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of
    research and development and will require the commitment of
    substantial financial resources, extensive research,
    development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing
     scale-up  and
    regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. Moreover, our
    commercially available products may require additional studies
    with respect to approved indications as well as new indications
    pending approval. If it becomes too expensive to sustain our
    present commitment of resources on a long-term basis, we will be
    unable to continue certain necessary research and development
    activities. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our clinical
    testing will render satisfactory results, or that we will
    receive required regulatory approvals for our new products or
    new indications. If any of our products, even if developed and
    approved, cannot be successfully commercialized, our business,
    financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could
    be materially adversely affected which could have a negative
    impact on the value of our common stock or debt securities
    obligations.

During
    the next several years, we will be very dependent on the
    continued commercial success of our primary products
    REVLIMID    
     and
    THALOMID   .   

During the next several years, the growth of our business will
    be largely dependent on the commercial success of
    REVLIMID   
    and our other products.
    REVLIMID   
    was approved by the FDA, EC, Swissmedic and Australia for
    treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma
    patients who have received at least one prior therapy. In
    addition,
    REVLIMID   
    was approved by the FDA and Canada for treatment of patients
    with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or
    intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q
    cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic
    abnormalities. We do not have long-term data on the use of the
    product and cannot predict whether
    REVLIMID   
    will continue to gain the acceptance

15

Table of Contents   

of regulators, physicians, patients and other key opinion
    leaders as a relatively safe and effective drug that has certain
    advantages as compared to existing or future therapies. We are
    also seeking to introduce
    REVLIMID   
    in additional international markets as well as obtaining
    approvals for additional indications both in the U.S. and
    internationally. A delay in gaining the requisite regulatory
    approvals could negatively impact our growth plans and the value
    of our common stock or debt securities obligations.

THALOMID   
    in combination with dexamethasone was approved by FDA in May
    2006 for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple
    myeloma. In addition,
    THALOMID   
    is currently approved as a therapy for the treatment of ENL,
    although the market for the use of
    THALOMID   
    in patients suffering from ENL is very small. If unexpected
    adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of
    THALOMID   
    by patients, this could undermine physician and patient comfort
    with the product, could limit the commercial success of the
    product and could even impact the acceptance of our other
    products, including
    REVLIMID   .

Our revenues and profits would be negatively impacted if adverse
    experiences were reported in connection with any of these two
    products or generic versions were to be approved and launched.
    See   We may not be able to protect our intellectual
    property and our products may be subject to generic
    competition   for additional discussion related to
    possible generic competition for
    THALOMID   .

If our
    products are not accepted by the market, demand for our products
    will deteriorate or not materialize at all.   

It is necessary that
    REVLIMID   ,
    THALOMID   ,
    ALKERAN   ,
    FOCALIN  tm  
    and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  ,
    and the
    RITALIN   
    family of drugs achieve and maintain market acceptance. A number
    of factors can render the degree of market acceptance of our
    products uncertain, including the products  efficacy,
    safety and advantages, if any, over competing products, as well
    as the reimbursement policies of third-party payors, such as
    government and private insurance plans. In particular,
    thalidomide, when used by pregnant women, has resulted in
    serious birth defects, and the negative history associated with
    thalidomide and birth defects may decrease the market acceptance
    of
    THALOMID   .
    In addition, the stem cell products that we are attempting to
    develop through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary may
    represent substantial departures from established treatment
    methods and will compete with a number of traditional products
    and therapies which are now, or may be in the future,
    manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and
    biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public attitudes may
    be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe, and
    stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or
    the medical community. If our products are not accepted by the
    market, demand for our products will deteriorate or not
    materialize at all.

We
    have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that
    growth our business could be adversely impacted.   

We have an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial
    and increasing investments in research and development, sales
    and marketing, and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and
    our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot control.
    For example:

we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level
    of operating expenses (including clinical trial costs, expenses
    associated with the regulatory approval process and
    commercialization of our products), and our ability to do so may
    depend on factors that we do not control;

we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and
    faster growing multinational organization; and

we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we
    manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing, marketing and
    distribution capacity, and our ability to do so may depend on
    factors that we do not control.

If the
    third parties upon whom we rely fail to produce on a timely
    basis the encapsulation, finishing and packaging services in the
    volumes that we require or fail to meet quality standards and
    maintain    

16

Table of Contents   

necessary licensure from regulatory authorities, we may be
    unable to meet demand for our products, potentially resulting in
    lost revenues.  

We have contracted with third party manufacturers to provide
    encapsulation, finishing services and packaging to meet our
    needs. We intend to continue to utilize third parties as needed
    to produce certain of our products on a commercial scale.

The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for
    THALOMID   
    is primarily obtained from our Zofingen, Switzerland,
    manufacturing facility and from Aptuit, Inc. Two additional
    suppliers are currently progressing through the qualification
    process. With regard to drug product manufacturing, we rely on
    two manufacturing service providers, Penn Pharmaceuticals
    Services Limited and Institute of Drug Technology Australia
    Limited, for the formulation and encapsulation of the finished
    dosage form of
    THALOMID   
    capsules, and on one contract packager, Sharp Corporation, for
    the packaging of the final product.

The API for
    REVLIMID   
    is manufactured primarily by our Zofingen, Switzerland,
    manufacturing facility and by Aptuit Inc. UK (previously
    Evotec). We have also contracted and registered two
    manufacturing service providers, Penn Pharmaceuticals Services
    Limited and OSG Norwich Pharmaceuticals, for the formulation and
    encapsulation of the finished dosage form of
    REVLIMID   
    capsules. Sharp and Norwich are the contractors approved for
    supplying the packaging for the final product in the
    U.S. and Sharp, located in the U.S., and Cimex AG located
    in Liesberg, Switzerland for the
     non-U.S. supply. 

The API for
    FOCALIN  tm  
    is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc.
    and Siegfried USA, Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer,
    Mikart, Inc., for the tableting and packaging of
    FOCALIN  tm  
    finished product. The API for FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    is supplied by both Siegfried and Johnson Matthey Inc. on behalf
    of Novartis for the manufacture of FOCALIN
    XR  tm  .

In all the countries where we sell our products, governmental
    regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing,
    packaging, labeling and storing. All of our suppliers of raw
    materials and contract manufacturers must comply with these
    regulations. Failure to do so could result in supply
    interruptions. In the United States, the FDA requires that all
    suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers
    of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve
    and maintain compliance with the FDA s cGMP regulations and
    guidelines. Failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply
    with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being
    imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil
    penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals,
    license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating
    restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could
    significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In
    addition, before any product batch produced by our manufacturers
    can be shipped, it must conform to release specifications
    pre-approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical
    product. If the operations of one or more of our manufacturers
    were to become unavailable for any reason, any required FDA
    review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier
    could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products. If our
    outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality,
    quantity or timeliness, or do not achieve and maintain
    compliance with all applicable regulations, demand for our
    products or our ability to continue supplying such products
    could substantially decline.

We are
    in the process of establishing foreign marketing and
    distribution capabilities.   

We are establishing marketing and distribution capabilities in
    international markets with respect to our products. At the same
    time, we are in the process of obtaining necessary governmental
    and regulatory approvals to sell our products in certain
    countries. If we have not successfully completed and implemented
    adequate marketing and distribution support services upon our
    receipt of such approvals, our ability to effectively launch our
    products in these countries would be severely restricted. In
    addition, we have contracted with Ivers Lee Corporation, d/b/a
    Sharp, a specialty distributor, to distribute
    THALOMID   
    and
    REVLIMID   
    in the United States. If Sharp does not perform its obligations,
    our ability to distribute
    THALOMID   
    and
    REVLIMID   
    in the United States may be impacted for a limited period of
    time.

We
    have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pharmion,
    subject to certain closing conditions, including the appropriate
    affirmative vote of Pharmion stockholders. The integration of
    Pharmion and other acquired businesses may present significant
    challenges to us.   

Achieving the anticipated benefits of our pending acquisition of
    Pharmion will depend in part upon whether we and Pharmion can
    integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner.
    In addition, we may acquire additional businesses from time to
    time. The integration of Pharmion and any future businesses that
    we may acquire involves a number of risks, including, but not
    limited to:

demands on management related to the increase in our size after
    the acquisition;

the diversion of management s attention from the management
    of daily operations to the integration of operations;

higher integration costs than anticipated;

failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;

difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;

difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and
    practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and
    geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and

difficulties in the integration of departments, systems,
    including accounting systems, technologies, books and records,
    and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards,
    controls, including internal control over financial reporting
    required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related
    procedures and policies.

If we cannot successfully integrate Pharmion or other acquired
    businesses, we may experience material negative consequences to
    our business, financial condition or results of operations.
    Successful integration of Pharmion and other acquired businesses
    will depend on our ability to manage these operations, to
    realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by offerings
    and expanded geographic market coverage and, to some degree, to
    eliminate redundant and excess costs. Because of difficulties in
    combining geographically distant operations, we may not be able
    to achieve the benefits that we hope to achieve as a result of
    the merger with Pharmion or other acquired businesses.

We may
    be unable to retain skilled personnel and maintain key
    relationships.   

The success of our business depends, in large part, on our
    continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly
    qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and
    marketing personnel, (ii) successfully integrate large
    numbers of new employees into our corporate culture, and
    (iii) develop and maintain important relationships with
    leading research and medical institutions and key distributors.
    Competition for these types of personnel and relationships is
    intense. In particular, the success of the combined operations
    after our pending acquisition of Pharmion will depend in part
    upon our ability to retain key employees of Pharmion. Key
    employees may depart because of issues relating to the
    difficulty of integration or accelerated retirement as a result
    of change in control severance provisions in their employment
    agreements with Pharmion.

Among other benefits, we use stock options to attract and retain
    personnel. Stock option accounting rules require us to recognize
    all stock-based compensation costs as expenses. These or other
    factors could reduce the number of shares management and our
    board of directors grants under our stock option plans. We
    cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled
    personnel or maintain key relationships, including key employees
    of Pharmion, or that the costs of retaining such personnel or
    maintaining such relationships will not materially increase.

The
    hazardous materials we use in our research, development and
    other business operations could result in significant
    liabilities, which could exceed our insurance coverage and
    financial resources.   

We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development
    and general business activities. While we believe we are
    currently in substantial compliance with the federal, state and
    local laws and regulations

18

Table of Contents   

governing the use of these materials, we cannot be certain that
    accidental injury or contamination will not occur. Any such
    accident or contamination could result in substantial
    liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and
    financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with
    environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in
    the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources
    either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance
    coverage.

The
    pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive government
    regulation which presents numerous risks to us.   

The discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials,
    manufacturing, marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and
    biologics are all subject to extensive regulation by numerous
    governmental authorities and agencies in the United States and
    other countries. If we or our contractors and collaborators are
    delayed in receiving, or are unable to obtain at all, necessary
    governmental approvals, we will be unable to effectively market
    our products.

The testing, marketing and manufacturing of our products require
    regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA and, in
    some cases, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
    or the EPA, or governmental authorities outside of the United
    States that perform roles similar to those of the FDA and EPA.
    Certain of our pharmaceutical products, such as
    FOCALIN  tm  ,
    fall under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 that requires
    authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA,
    of the U.S. Department of Justice in order to handle and
    distribute these products. The regulatory approval process
    presents several risks to us:

In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many
    years, and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and
    the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible
    to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent
    regulatory approval;

Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the
    regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or
    other data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure
    of the product to meet, a regulatory agency s requirements
    for safety, efficacy and quality or, in the case of a product
    seeking an orphan drug indication, because another designee
    received approval first or receives approval of other labeled
    indications;

Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to
    changes in regulatory agency policy, or the adoption of new
    regulations or legislation;

The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may
    significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may
    be marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant
    limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and
    contra-indications that could materially affect the sales and
    profitability of the drug;

Pricing and reimbursement controls;

Approved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject
    to continuing and ongoing review, and discovery of previously
    unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to
    manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in
    restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their
    withdrawal from the market;

Regulatory authorities and agencies of the United States or
    foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations
    restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products;

Guidelines and recommendations published by various
    non-governmental organizations can reduce the use of our
    products;

Once a product receives marketing approval, we may not market
    that product for broader or different applications, and the FDA
    may not grant us approval with respect to separate product
    applications that represent extensions of our basic technology.
    In addition, the FDA may withdraw or modify existing approvals
    in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations
    restricting the sale of our present

19

Table of Contents   

or proposed products. The FDA may also request that we perform
    additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our
    existing or proposed products if we or others identify side
    effects after our products are on the market;

Products, such as
    REVLIMID   ,
    that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an
    expedited withdrawal if the post-marketing study commitments are
    not completed with due diligence, the post-marketing
    restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to
    assure the safe use of the drug, or evidence demonstrates that
    the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under its
    conditions of use. Additionally, promotional materials for such
    products are subject to enhanced surveillance, including
    pre-approval review of all promotional materials used within
    120 days following marketing approval and a requirement for
    the submissions 30 days prior to initial dissemination of
    all promotional materials disseminated after 120 days
    following marketing approval; and

Our labeling and promotional activities relating to our products
    are regulated by the FDA and state regulatory agencies and, in
    some circumstances, by the DEA, and are subject to associated
    risks. If we fail to comply with FDA regulations prohibiting
    promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for
    which marketing clearance has not been obtained, the FDA, or the
    Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and
    Human Services or the state Attorneys General could bring an
    enforcement action against us that could inhibit our marketing
    capabilities as well as result in significant penalties.

Additionally, the FDA approval process would allow for the
    approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a generic
    version of our approved products upon the expiration, through
    passage of time or successful legal challenge, of relevant
    patent or non-patent exclusivity protection. ANDAs and 505(b)(2)
    applications are generally less burdensome than full NDAs in
    that, in lieu of clinical data, these applications rely in
    whole, or in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings of the
    referenced approved product in conjunction with bridging data,
    typically bioequivalence data.

The FDA s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
    currently regulates under 21 CFR Parts 1270 and 1271 human
    tissue intended for transplantation that is recovered,
    processed, stored or distributed by methods that do not change
    tissue function or characteristics and that is not currently
    regulated as a human drug, biological product or medical device.
    Certain stem cell-related activities fall within this category.
    Part 1270 requires tissue establishments to screen and test
    donors, to prepare and follow written procedures for the
    prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to maintain
    records. It also provides for inspection by the FDA of tissue
    establishments. Part 1271 requires human cells, tissue and
    cellular and tissue-based product establishments (HCT/Ps) to
    register with the agency and list their HCT/Ps.

Currently, we are required to be, and are, licensed to operate
    in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware, four of the
    states in which we currently collect placentas and umbilical
    cord blood for our allogeneic and private stem cell banking
    businesses, and we are in process of obtaining a license in the
    state of California. If other states adopt similar licensing
    requirements, we would need to obtain such licenses to continue
    operating. If we are delayed in receiving, or are unable to
    obtain at all, necessary licenses, we will be unable to provide
    services in those states and this would impact negatively on our
    revenues.

We may
    not be able to protect our intellectual property and our
    products may be subject to generic competition.   

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and
    enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to
    technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business
    without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The
    patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical firms,
    including ours, can be uncertain and involve complex legal and
    factual questions.

Under the current U.S. patent laws, patent applications
    filed in the United States on or before November 28, 2000
    are maintained in secrecy until patents issue. Patent
    applications filed in the U.S. on or after
    November 29, 2000 are not published until approximately
    18 months after their earliest claimed priority date, and
    publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent
    literature often lag behind actual discoveries.

20

Table of Contents   

Thus, we may discover sometime in the future that we, or the
    third parties from whom we have licensed patents or patent
    applications, were not the first to make
     and/or  file
    the inventions covered by the patents and patent applications in
    which we have or seek rights. In the event that a third party
    has also filed a patent application for any of the inventions
    claimed in our patents or patent applications, or those we have
    licensed-in, we could become involved in an interference
    proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
    Office, or the PTO, to determine priority of invention or an
    opposition proceeding in other places such as Europe. Such an
    interference or opposition could result in the loss of an issued
    U.S. or foreign patent, respectively, or loss of any
    opportunity to secure U.S. patent protection for that
    invention. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, such
    proceedings could result in substantial cost and delay to us and
    limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In addition, the coverage sought in a patent application may not
    be obtained or may be significantly reduced before the patent is
    issued. Consequently, if our pending applications, or pending
    application that we have licensed-in from third parties, do not
    result in the issuance of patents or if any patents that are
    issued do not provide significant proprietary protection or
    commercial advantage, our ability to sustain the necessary level
    of intellectual property rights upon which our success depends
    may be restricted.

Moreover, different countries have different procedures for
    obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries
    provide different degrees of protection against the use of a
    patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us
    or our licensors, in a given country, of a patent covering an
    invention is not followed by the issuance in other countries of
    patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial
    interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the
    claims in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the
    interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in
    another country, our ability to protect our intellectual
    property in other countries may be limited.

Furthermore, even if our patent applications, or those we have
    licensed-in, are issued, our competitors may still challenge the
    scope, validity or enforceability of such patents in court,
    requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly
    litigation. Alternatively, our competitors may be able to design
    around such patents and compete with us using the resulting
    alternative technology. If any of our issued or licensed patents
    are infringed, we may not be successful in enforcing our or our
    licensor s intellectual property rights or defending the
    validity or enforceability of our issued patents and
    subsequently not be able to develop or market applicable product
    exclusively.

We rely upon unpatented proprietary and trade secret technology
    that we try to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements
    with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside
    scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other
    advisors. If these agreements are breached, we may not have
    adequate remedies for any such breach. Despite precautions taken
    by us, others may obtain access to or independently develop our
    proprietary technology or such technology may be found to be
    non-proprietary or not a trade secret.

Our right to practice the inventions claimed in certain patents
    that relate to
    THALOMID   
    arises under licenses granted to us by others, including The
    Rockefeller University and Children s Medical Center
    Corporation, or CMCC. In addition to these patents, which relate
    to thalidomide, we have also licensed from CMCC certain patents
    relating to thalidomide analogs. In December 2002, we entered
    into an exclusive license agreement with CMCC and EntreMed Inc.
    pursuant to which CMCC exclusively licensed to us certain
    patents and patent applications that relate to analogs,
    metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide,
    and all stereoisomers thereof. Our license under the December
    2002 agreement is worldwide and royalty-bearing, and we have
    complete control over the prosecution of the licensed
    thalidomide analog patent rights. Under this December 2002
    agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain milestones
    for a
    REVLIMID   
    approval and royalties with respect to sales of
    REVLIMID   .
    The December 2002 agreement also grants us an option for a
    certain time period to inventions in the field of thalidomide
    analogs that may be developed at CMCC in the laboratory of
    Dr. Robert D Amato, pursuant to the terms and
    conditions of a separate Sponsored Research Agreement negotiated
    between CMCC and us.

Further, while we believe these confidentiality agreements and
    license agreements to be valid and enforceable, our rights under
    these agreements may not continue or disputes concerning these
    agreements may

21

Table of Contents   

arise. If any of the foregoing should occur, we may be unable to
    rely upon our unpatented proprietary and trade secret
    technology, or we may be unable to use the third-party
    proprietary technology we have licensed-in, either of which may
    prevent or hamper us from successfully pursuing our business.

It is also possible that third-party patent applications and
    patents could issue with claims that broadly cover certain
    aspects of our business or of the subject matter claimed in the
    patents or patent applications owned or optioned by us or
    licensed to us, which may limit our ability to conduct our
    business or to practice under our patents, and may impede our
    efforts to obtain meaningful patent protection of our own. If
    patents are issued to third parties that contain competitive or
    conflicting claims, we may be legally prohibited from pursuing
    research, development or commercialization of potential products
    or be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop
    or obtain alternative technology. We may be legally prohibited
    from using patented technology, may not be able to obtain any
    license to the patents and technologies of third parties on
    acceptable terms, if at all, or may not be able to obtain or
    develop alternative technologies. Consequently, if we cannot
    successfully defend against any patent infringement suit that
    may be brought against us by a third-party, we may lose the
    ability to continue to conduct our business as we presently do,
    or to practice certain subject matter delineated by patent
    claims that we have exclusive rights to, whether by ownership or
    by license, and that may have a material adverse effect on our
    business.

We rely upon trademarks and service marks to protect our rights
    to the intellectual property used in our business.

Litigation
    on a variety of matters may subject us to significant legal
    expenses and liability.   

From time to time, we may be subject to litigation on a variety
    of matters, including, as discussed above, intellectual
    property, licensing arrangements with other persons and product
    liability. Litigation requires the expenditure of significant
    time and resources, and is inherently unpredictable. If any
    litigation were to have an unanticipated adverse result, there
    could be a material impact on our results of operations or
    financial position.

The
    pharmaceutical and biotech industry is highly competitive and
    subject to rapid and significant technological
    change.   

The pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is highly
    competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological
    change. Our present and potential competitors include major
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty
    pharmaceutical firms, including but not limited to:

Amgen, which potentially competes with our TNF-  and kinase
    inhibitors;

Novartis, which potentially competes with our
    IMiDs   
    compounds and kinase programs;

Bristol Myers Squibb Co., which potentially competes in clinical
    trials with our
    IMiDs   
    compounds and TNF-  inhibitors;

Genentech, Inc., which potentially competes in clinical trials
    with our
    IMiDs   
    compounds and TNF-  inhibitors;

AstraZeneca plc, which potentially competes in clinical trials
    with our
    IMiDs   
    compounds and TNF-  inhibitors;

Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Johnson   Johnson,
    which compete with
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with
    our
    IMiDs   
    compounds;

Pfizer Inc., which potentially competes in clinical trials with
    our kinase inhibitors;

Biogen Idec Inc. and Genzyme Corporation, both of which are
    generally developing drugs that address the oncology and
    immunology markets; and

Johnson   Johnson, which potentially competes with
    certain of our proprietary programs including our oral
    anti-inflammatory programs.

22

Table of Contents   

Many of these companies have considerably greater financial,
    technical and marketing resources than we do. We also experience
    competition from universities and other research institutions,
    and in some instances, we compete with others in acquiring
    technology from these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has
    undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and
    significant technological change, and we expect competition to
    intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become
    more widely known. The development of products, including
    generics, or processes by our competitors with significant
    advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause
    the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline.

Sales
    of our products are dependent on third-party
    reimbursement.   

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to
    which the costs of our products will be paid by health
    maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health
    care management organizations, or reimbursed by government
    health administration authorities, private health coverage
    insurers and other third-party payors. These health care
    management organizations and third-party payors are increasingly
    challenging the prices charged for medical products and
    services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has
    become a priority of federal and state governments, and the
    prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. If these
    organizations and third-party payors do not consider our
    products to be cost-effective compared to other available
    therapies, they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our
    products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be
    sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable
    basis.

Changes
    in our effective income tax rate could impact our
    earnings.   

Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our
    effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not
    limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, the accounting
    for stock options and other share-based payments, changes in tax
    laws and rates, future levels of research and development
    spending, changes in accounting standards, future levels of
    capital expenditures, changes in the mix of earnings in the
    various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the outcome of
    IRS exams and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The
    impact on our income tax provision resulting from the
    above-mentioned factors may be significant and could have an
    impact on our results of operations.

Our
    operations may be impacted by currency fluctuations that may
    cause our earnings to fluctuate.   

Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies could impact our earnings. We anticipate
    utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign
    currency risk and not to engage in currency speculation. We
    would use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted
    transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our hedging
    efforts would reduce but not eliminate our anticipated exposure
    to currency fluctuations. Any significant foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations within a short period of time could still adversely
    affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We may
    experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet
    our financial reporting obligations.   

As our Company continues to expand at a rapid pace, the
    development of new and improvements to existing automated
    systems will remain an ongoing priority. During this expansion
    period, our internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting. Such
    misstatements may result in litigation
     and/or 
    negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction
    that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our
    common stock or debt securities obligations.

The
    price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may
    make it difficult for you to sell the common stock when you want
    or at prices you find attractive.   

There has been significant volatility in the market prices for
    publicly traded shares of biopharmaceutical companies, including
    ours. We expect that the market price of our common stock will
    continue to fluctuate. The
     intra-day 
    price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $75.44 per
    share to a low of $41.26 per share in 2007. On December 31,
    2007, our common stock closed at a price of $46.21 per share.
    The price of

23

Table of Contents   

our common stock may not remain at or exceed current levels. The
    following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market
    price of our common stock:

results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with
    our marketed products;

announcements of technical or product developments by our
    competitors;

market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks;

market conditions generally;

governmental regulation;

new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;

health care legislation;

public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment
    of the disease states that we are targeting;

patent or proprietary rights developments;

changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for
    our products;

fluctuations in our operating results;

the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes
    related to production and formulation of those products or uses
    of those products;

competition;

investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product
    acquisitions.

The market price of our common stock may also decline as a
    result of the pending acquisition of Pharmion if the integration
    with Pharmion is unsuccessful or takes longer than expected; the
    perceived benefits of the merger are not achieved as rapidly as
    anticipated or, to the extent anticipated, by financial analysts
    or investors; or the effect of the merger on our financial
    results is not consistent with the expectations of financial
    analysts or investors.

In addition, the stock market in general and the biotechnology
    sector in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has
    often been unrelated to the operating performance of a
    particular company. These broad market fluctuations may
    adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

The
    number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale
    could adversely affect the market price of our common
    stock.   

Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or debt
    or other securities convertible into common stock could
    adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of
    December 31, 2007, there were outstanding stock options and
    warrants for 33,096,086 shares of common stock, of which
    22,320,094 were currently vested and exercisable at an exercise
    price between $0.04 per share and $73.55 per share, with a
    weighted average exercise price of $18.97 per share. In
    addition, in June 2003, we issued $400.0 million of
    unsecured convertible notes that are currently convertible into
    16,227,441 shares of our common stock at the conversion
    price of $12.1125. These notes will mature in June 2008. The
    conversion of some or all of these notes will dilute the
    ownership interest of our stockholders. In addition, we will
    issue between 24,000,000 and 32,000,000 shares of our
    common stock in the merger, all of which may be immediately
    resold.

Our
    shareholder rights plan and certain charter and by-law
    provisions may deter a third-party from acquiring us and may
    impede the stockholders  ability to remove and replace our
    management or board of directors.   

Our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan,
    the purpose of which is to protect stockholders against
    unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer
    a fair price to all of our

24

Table of Contents   

stockholders. The rights plan may have the effect of dissuading
    a potential acquirer from making an offer for our common stock
    at a price that represents a premium to the then current trading
    price.

Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time,
    without further stockholder approval, up to
    5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the
    price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An
    issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party from
    acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
    Additionally, our board of directors has adopted certain
    amendments to our by-laws intended to strengthen the
    board s position in the event of a hostile takeover
    attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders 
    ability to remove and replace our management
     and/or  board
    of directors.

Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of

PROPERTIES   

Our corporate headquarters, which is located in Summit, New
    Jersey on approximately 45 acres of land, was purchased in
    2004 and consists of several buildings, which house our
    administrative, sales, marketing and research functions.

Construction of our international headquarters in Neuchatel,
    Switzerland was completed in 2007 and includes a drug product
    manufacturing facility to perform formulation, encapsulation,
    packaging, warehousing and distribution. In December 2006, we
    purchased an API manufacturing facility located in Zofingen,
    Switzerland which has the capability to produce multiple drug
    substances. The facility is being used to produce
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    API to supply global markets and may also be used to produce
    drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates.

We occupy the following facilities under operating lease
    arrangements that have remaining lease terms greater than
    one-year. Under these lease arrangements, we also are required
    to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance,
    utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. All leases are
    with unaffiliated parties.

73,500-square feet of laboratory and office space in Warren, New
    Jersey. The two leases for this facility extend through May 2012
    and July 2010, respectively, and contain five-year renewal
    options. Annual rent for these facilities is approximately
    $1.1 million.

78,200-square feet of laboratory and office space in
    San Diego, California. The lease for this facility has a
    term ending in August 2012 with one five-year renewal option.
    Annual rent for this facility is approximately $2.1 million
    and is subject to specified annual rental increases.

20,800-square feet of office and laboratory space in Cedar
    Knolls, New Jersey. The lease for this facility has a term
    ending at the end of October 2010 with renewal options for
    additional five-year terms. Annual rent for this facility is
    approximately $0.3 million and is subject to specified
    annual rental increases.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS   

Barr Laboratories, Inc., ( Barr ) a generic drug
    manufacturer located in Pomona, New York, filed an ANDA for the
    treatment of ENL in the manner described in our label and
    seeking permission from the FDA to market a generic version of
    50mg, 100mg and 200mg
    THALOMID   .
    Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic
    manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a
     Paragraph IV certification ) challenging the
    validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDA s
    Orange Book four years after the pioneer company obtains
    approval of its New Drug Application, or an NDA. On or after
    December 5, 2006, Barr mailed notices of Paragraph IV
    certifications alleging that the following patents listed for
    THALOMID   
    in the Orange Book are invalid, unenforceable,
     and/or  not
    infringed: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,045,501 ( the  501
    patent ), 6,315,720 ( the  720 patent ),
    6,561,976 ( the  976 patent ), 6,561,977
    ( the  977 patent ), 6,755,784 ( the
     784 patent ), 6,869,399 ( the  399
    patent ), 6,908,432 ( the  432 patent ), and
    7,141,018 ( the  018 patent ). The  501,
     976, and  432 patents do not expire until
    August 28, 2018, while the remaining patents do not expire
    until October 23, 2020. On January 18, 2007, we filed
    an infringement action in the United States District Court of
    New Jersey against Barr. By bringing suit, we are entitled up to
    a maximum
     30-month 
    stay, from the date of Celgene s receipt of a
    Paragraph IV certification, against the FDA s approval
    of a generic applicant s application to market a generic
    version of
    THALOMID   .
    In June 2007, United States Patent No. 7,230,012, or
     012 patent, was issued to us claiming formulations of
    thalidomide and was then timely listed in the Orange Book. Barr
    sent us a supplemental Paragraph IV certification against
    the  012 patent and alleged that the claims of the
     012 patent, directed to formulations which encompass
    THALOMID   ,
    were invalid. On August 23, 2007, we filed an infringement
    action in the United States District Court of New Jersey with
    respect to the  012 patent. On or after October 4,
    2007, Barr filed a second supplemental notice of
    Paragraph IV certifications relating to the 150mg dosage
    strength of
    THALOMID   
    alleging that the  501 patent,  720 patent,  976
    patent,  977 patent,  784 patent,  399 patent,
     432 patent and the  018 patent are invalid,
    unenforceable,
     and/or  not
    infringed. On November 14, 2007, we filed an infringement
    action in the United States District Court of New Jersey against
    Barr. All three actions have subsequently been consolidated. We
    intend to enforce our patent rights. If the ANDA is approved by
    the FDA, and Barr is successful in challenging our patents
    listed in the Orange Book for
    THALOMID   ,
    Barr would be permitted to sell a generic thalidomide product.

On August 19, 2004, we, together with our exclusive
    licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United
    States District Court of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals
    USA, Inc., ( Teva ) in response to notices of
    Paragraph IV certifications made by Teva in connection with
    the filing of an ANDA for
    FOCALIN   .
    The notification letters from Teva contend that United States
    Patent Nos. 5,908,850, or  850 patent, and 6,355,656, or
     656 patent, are invalid. After the suit was filed,
    Novartis listed another patent, United States Patent
    No. 6,528,530, or  530 patent, in the Orange Book in
    association with the
    FOCALIN   
    NDA. The original 2004 action asserted infringement of the
     850 patent. Teva amended its answer during discovery to
    contend that the  850 patent was not infringed by the
    filing of its ANDA, and that the  850 patent is not
    enforceable due to an allegation of inequitable conduct. Fact
    discovery in the original 2004 action expired on
    February 28, 2006. At about the time of the filing of the
     850 patent infringement action, reexamination proceedings
    for the  656 patent were initiated in the U.S. PTO. On
    September 28, 2006, the U.S. PTO issued a Notice of
    Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate, and on
    March 27, 2007, the Reexamination Certificate for the
     656 patent issued. On December 21, 2006, Celgene and
    Novartis filed an action in the United States District Court of
    New Jersey against Teva for infringement of the  656
    patent. Teva filed an amended answer and counterclaim on
    March 23, 2007. The amended counterclaim seeks a
    declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and
    unenforceability. The statutory
     30-month 
    stay of FDA approval of Teva s ANDA expired on
    January 9, 2007, and Teva proceeded to market with a
    generic version

    FOCALIN   .
    Novartis  sales of
    FOCALIN   
    have been significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic
    FOCALIN   
    product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties
    associated with these sales. A claim has been made for damages
    resulting from Teva s sales and for a permanent injunction
    prohibiting future sales by Teva. The parties currently are
    engaged in fact discovery with respect to the  656 patent
    and other issues related to Teva s product launch. No trial
    date has been set. The  530 patent is not part of this
    patent infringement action against Teva.

On September 14, 2007, we, together with our exclusive
    licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United
    States District Court for the District of New Jersey against
    Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. in response to a notice of a
    Paragraph IV certification made by Teva in connection with
    the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN
    XR   .
    The notification letter from Teva contends that claims in United
    States Patent Nos. 5,908,850 and 6,528,530 are invalid,
    unenforceable, and not infringed by the proposed Teva products,
    and it contends that United States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and
    6,635,284 are invalid and not infringed by the proposed Teva
    products. Celgene and Novartis asserted each of these patents
    and additionally asserted United States Patent
    No. 6,355,656 in their complaint against Teva. Teva filed
    an answer and counterclaim on November 5, 2007. The
    counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity,
    noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect to the
     patents-in-suit. 
    No trial date has been set. If we are unsuccessful in proving
    infringement or defending our patents, Novartis  sales of
    FOCALIN
    XR   
    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic FOCALIN
    XR   
    product, consequently reducing our revenue from royalties
    associated with these sales.

On October 5, 2007, we, together with our exclusive
    licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United
    States District Court for the District of New Jersey against
    IntelliPharmaCeutics Corp. ( IPC ) in response to a
    notice of a Paragraph IV certification made by IPC in
    connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN
    XR   .
    The notification letter from IPC contends that claims in United
    States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are not
    infringed by the proposed IPC products. The notification letter
    also contends that claims in United States Patent Nos.
    5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284 are
    invalid, and that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,
    6,355,656 and 6,528,530 are unenforceable. In their complaint
    against IPC, Celgene and Novartis asserted United States Patent
    Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284, and 6,635,284.
    IPC filed an answer and counterclaim on November 20, 2007.
    The counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent
    invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect
    to Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, and 6,528,530, and it seeks
    a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and noninfringement
    with respect to Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. No pretrial
    or trial dates have been set. If we are unsuccessful in proving

    (collectively,  Abrika ) in response to a notice of a
    Paragraph IV certification made by Abrika in connection
    with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN
    XR   .
    The notification letter from Abrika contends that claims in
    United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 5,837,284, and
    6,635,284 are not infringed by the proposed Abrika products, and
    it contends that claims in United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850,
    6,355,656, 6,528,530, 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid. In
    their complaint against Abrika, Celgene and Novartis asserted
    United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, 6,355,656, 6,528,530,
    5,837,284, and 6,635,284. No pretrial or trial dates have been

    response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification made
    by Abrika in connection with the filing of an ANDA for RITALIN

    notification letter from Abrika contends that claims in United
    States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid and are
    not infringed by the proposed Abrika products. In their
    complaint against Abrika, Celgene and Novartis asserted United
    States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. Abrika filed an
    answer and counterclaim in the New Jersey court on June 1,
    2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent
    invalidity, noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect
    to the

    and
    THALOMID   .
    REVLIMID   
    is an oral immunomodulatory drug approved by the FDA, the
    European Commission, or EC, Swissmedic and the Australian
    Therapeutic Goods Administration for treatment in combination
    with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have
    received at least one prior therapy.
    REVLIMID   
    is also approved by the FDA and Canadian Therapeutic Products
    Directorate for treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent
    anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, associated with a
    deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional
    cytogenetic abnormalities.
    THALOMID   
    was approved by the FDA in combination with dexamethasone for
    the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and for the
    treatment of acute cutaneous manifestations of moderate to
    severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, and as maintenance
    therapy for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous
    manifestation of ENL recurrence. Over the past several years, we
    have made substantial investments in research and development
    and the drug candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of
    preclinical and clinical development. These candidates include
    our
    IMiDs   
    compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and
    having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important
    properties in addition to our leading oral anti-inflammatory
    agents. We believe that our primary commercial stage products
    and depth of our product pipeline provide the catalysts for our
    future growth.

Factors
    Affecting Future Results   

Future operating results will depend on many factors, including
    demand for our products, regulatory approvals of our products
    and product candidates, the timing and market acceptance of new
    products launched

Table of Contents   

by us or competing companies, the timing of research and
    development milestones, challenges to our intellectual property
    and our ability to control costs. See also the Risk Factors
    discussion contained in Part I, Item 1A. Some of the
    more signficant factors that we are focused on include: the
    ability of
    REVLIMID   
    to successfully penetrate and expand in relevant markets, our
    ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs and
    competitive risks.

The ability of
    REVLIMID   
    to successfully penetrate and expand in relevant
    markets :  The introduction of
    REVLIMID   
    in the United States has included among other things,
    registering physicians in the
    RevAssist   
    program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution
    program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of
    REVLIMID   
    and partnering with contracted pharmacies to ensure, to the
    maximum extent possible, safe and rapid distribution of
    REVLIMID   .
    In international markets,
    REVLIMID   
    was granted approval by the European Commission, Swissmedic,
    Canadian Therapeutic Products Directorate and Australian
    Therapeutic Goods Administration with product launches already
    initiated in several of the approved countries. We are also
    continuing to work with the appropriate regulatory authorities
    to determine next steps for pricing, reimbursement and
    distribution in those countries in which
    REVLIMID   
    has not yet been launched. We do not have long-term data on the
    use of
    REVLIMID   
    and cannot predict whether
    REVLIMID   
    will continue to gain widespread acceptance from regulators,
    physicians, patients, opinion leaders, government health
    agencies and private health plans.

The ability to advance regulatory and clinical
    programs:   A Marketing Authorization Application,
    or MAA, seeking approval to market
    REVLIMID   
    for treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to
    low-or-intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated
    with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without
    additional cytogenetic abnormalities was evaluated by the
    European Medicines Agency s, or EMEA, Committee for
    Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP and a negative opinion
    issued in January 2008. The CHMP concluded that lenalidomide is
    efficacious in patients suffering from deletion 5q MDS. Based on
    information available to the CHMP from the uncontrolled,
    open-label, 148-patient Phase II study (MDS-003), the CHMP
    was not convinced the data were sufficient to assure safety. We
    intend to apply for a reexamination of the CHMP opinion in
    accordance with relevant EMEA procedures. Other international
    regulatory initiatives include MAA s under evaluation in
    New Zealand and Israel.

In April 2007, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group reported
    that its Data Monitoring Committee s review of preliminary
    results from a large, randomized clinical trial for patients
    with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma found that the use of a
    low-dose of dexamethasone in combination with
    REVLIMID   
    suggests survival advantage for patients when compared to the
    higher, standard-dose of dexamethasone that is used in
    combination with
    REVLIMID   
    to treat the disease. These results were also presented at the
    June 2007 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology medical
    conference and updated at the December 2007 annual American
    Society of Hematology meeting. The regulatory utility of these
    findings will be discussed with the FDA.

A major objective of our on-going clinical programs is to
    broaden our knowledge about the full potential of
    REVLIMID   
    and our other proprietary
    IMiDs   
    compounds and to continue to evaluate them in a broad range of
    hematological malignancies and other cancers. Our near-term
    focus is on evaluating
    REVLIMID   
    as a treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and
    aggressive non-Hodgkin s lymphomas, or NHL. In November
    2007,
    REVLIMID   
    was granted orphan medicinal product designation by the EC for
    treatment of CLL.

Competitive Risks:   While competition could
    limit
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    sales, we do not believe that competing products would eliminate
    their use entirely. Moreover, while generic competitors could
    seek to challenge our
    THALOMID   
    franchise, we own intellectual property which includes, for
    example, U.S. patents covering our
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    distribution program for the safe distribution and appropriate
    use of thalidomide, which all physicians, patients and
    pharmacies prescribing, receiving or dispensing thalidomide in
    the United States must follow. We also have exclusive rights to
    several issued patents covering the use of
    THALOMID   
    in oncology and other therapeutic areas.

Company
    Background  

In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and, in July
    1987, we completed an initial public offering. Initially, our
    operations involved research and development of chemical and
    biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical
    industries. Between 1990 and 1998, our revenues were derived
    primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure
    intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug
    development. By 1998, sales of chirally pure intermediates
    became a less integral part of our strategic focus and, in
    January 1998, we sold the chiral intermediates business to
    Cambrex Corporation.

In July 1998, we received our first approval for
    THALOMID   
    from the FDA which allowed us to market
    THALOMID   
    for the treatment and suppression of ENL, an inflammatory
    complication of leprosy. In May 2006, the FDA approved
    THALOMID   
    in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly
    diagnosed multiple myeloma.

In April 2000, we entered into a development and license
    agreement with Novartis Pharma AG in which we granted to
    Novartis an exclusive worldwide license to further develop and
    market
    FOCALIN  tm  ,
    our chirally pure version of
    RITALIN   .
    The agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone
    payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the
    regulatory approval process. Under the agreement, we sell
    FOCALIN  tm  
    to Novartis as well as receive royalties on all of
    Novartis  sales of FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    and
    RITALIN   
    family of ADHD-related products.

In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
    currently known as Signal Pharmaceuticals LLC, d/b/a Celgene
    Research San Diego, a biopharmaceutical company focused on
    the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes
    associated with disease.

In November 2001, we licensed to Pharmion Corporation exclusive
    rights relating to the development and commercial use of our
    intellectual property covering thalidomide and
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    in all countries outside of North America, Japan, China, Taiwan
    and Korea (see our references below to the December 2004
    amendment with respect to these territories).

In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., which was a
    privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord
    blood banking business developing technologies for the recovery
    of stem cells from human placental tissues following the
    completion of full-term, successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis,
    d/b/a Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now operates as a
    wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation, engaged in the
    research, recovery, culture-expansion, preservation, development
    and distribution of placental stem cells as therapeutic agents.

In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution
    agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote
    and sell
    ALKERAN   ,
    or melphalan ,  a therapy approved by the FDA for the
    palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the
    ovary. The agreement requires that we purchase
    ALKERAN   
    from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under
    the Celgene label. The agreement has been extended through
    March 31, 2009.

In October 2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, or Penn T, a
    supplier of
    THALOMID   .
    Through manufacturing agreements acquired in the transaction, we
    are able to control manufacturing for
    THALOMID   .
    In the transaction, we also acquired a product supply agreement
    to exclusively supply Pharmion with thalidomide, thereby
    enabling us to increase our participation in thalidomide sales
    in key international markets. Subsequently, in December 2004, we
    amended the thalidomide supply agreement with Pharmion and
    granted them license rights in additional territories. As
    amended, the territory licensed to Pharmion is for all countries
    other than the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and China,
    excluding Hong Kong.

In December 2005, the FDA approved
    REVLIMID   
    for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia
    due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes
    associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or
    without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and, in June 2006,
    the FDA approved
    REVLIMID   
    for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple

34

Table of Contents   

myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy.
    In June 2007,
    REVLIMID   
    was granted full marketing authorization by the EC for use in
    combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with
    multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy
    and in September 2007, approval was granted by Swissmedic and in
    January 2008 by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee for use
    in this same indication. In November 2007 the EC granted
    REVLIMID   
    orphan medicinal product designation for treatment of CLL. In
    addition, in January 2008,
    REVLIMID   
    was approved by the Canadian Therapeutic Products Directorate
    for treatment of patients with MDS, associated with a deletion
    5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional
    cytogenetic abnormalities.

In November 2006, we issued an additional 20,000,000 shares
    of our common stock at a public offering price of $51.60 per
    share with net proceeds of $1.006 billion.

In December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and
    certain assets and liabilities from Siegfried located in
    Zofingen, Switzerland. The API facility has the capability to
    produce multiple drug substances and is being used to produce
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    API to supply global markets. The facility also may be used to
    produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates.

In November 2007, we announced the signing of a definitive
    merger agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Pharmion
    Corporation. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we will
    acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pharmion common stock
    for $72.00 per share payable in a combination of cash and shares
    of Celgene common stock. The transaction has been unanimously
    approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is
    subject to customary closing conditions including the approval
    of the acquisition by Pharmion stockholders and receipt of
    antitrust clearances. The
     Hart-Scott-Rodino 
    Act, or HSR, thirty day waiting period has expired without the
    United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requesting
    additional information with regard to the merger. In addition,
    the Bundeskartellamt, Germany s Federal Cartel Office in
    charge of reviewing the antitrust aspects of mergers and
    acquisitions, has cleared Celgene s pending acquisition of
    Pharmion Corporation. On February 5, 2008 the
     Form S-4 
    relating to the merger of Pharmion and Celgene was declared
    effective by the SEC. The merger is expected to be completed in
    March 2008. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information.

Net
    Product Sales:   

2007 compared to
    2006:   REVLIMID   
    net sales increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to
    the product s expanded use in the United States resulting
    from the FDA s June 2006 approval for treatment in
    combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple myeloma
    who have received at least one prior therapy in multiple myeloma
    and growth in Europe resulting from the June 2007 European
    Commission s approval for the use of
    REVLIMID   
    in this same indication. Also contributing to the increase in
    sales were price increases and increased sales from our European
    Named Patient Program, or NPP, which offers European patients in
    need of treatment access to
    REVLIMID   
    on a compassionate use basis.

Net sales of
    THALOMID   
    were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to price
    increases, partly offset by lower sales volumes as prescriptions
    written declined, reflecting the expanded use of
    REVLIMID   .

ALKERAN   
    net sales were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to
    increased prices and a decrease in product returns.

2006 compared to 2005 :  In 2006, net sales of
    REVLIMID   
    were driven primarily by the December 2005 FDA approval for the
    treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to
    low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated
    with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without
    additional cytogenetic abnormalities and the June 2006 approval
    for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with
    multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.
    REVLIMID   
    net sales recorded in 2005 related to initial stocking at
    certain contracted pharmacies following the product s
    approval on December 27, 2005.

THALOMID   
    net sales were higher in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to
    the FDA s May 2006 approval for treatment in combination
    with dexamethasone of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Price
    increases implemented as we shifted towards a cost of therapy
    pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram basis also
    contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting the increase
    in
    THALOMID   
    sales were sales volume decreases and higher gross to net sales
    adjustments.

ALKERAN   
    net sales were slightly higher in 2006, compared to 2005 as
    sales benefited from an increase in
    ALKERAN   
    tablet sales volumes, as well as price increases implemented
    during 2006, particularly in
    ALKERAN   
    IVs (injectables). Largely offsetting the increase in sales were
    higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and
    distributor chargebacks.

Sales of
    FOCALIN  tm  ,
    which is sold exclusively to Novartis and is dependent on the
    timing of orders from Novartis for their commercial
    distribution, were higher in 2006, compared to 2005, due to
    increased end-market demand.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals:   We record gross
    to net sales accruals for sales returns, sales discounts,
    Medicaid rebates and distributor charge-backs and service fees.
    We base our sales returns allowance, which primarily relates to
    THALOMID   ,
    on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, actual returns
    history and other known factors, such as the trend experience
    for lots where product is still being returned and inventory
    centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by
    major pharmacy chains. If the historical data we use to
    calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future
    returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the
    period in which such a determination is made and revenues in
    that period could be materially affected. Under this
    methodology, we track actual returns by individual production
    lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible
    for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns
    experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible
    for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical
    return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates
    are considered in determining the current sales return
    allowance. We do not use information from external sources in
    estimating our product returns.
    THALOMID   
    is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a
    result, wholesalers do not stock the product.
    REVLIMID   
    is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending
    itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the
    supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity to
    date. Sales discounts accruals are based on payment terms
    extended to customers. Medicaid rebate accruals are based on
    historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid
    beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate
    amount formula established by the Center for Medicaid and
    Medicare Services.

36

Table of Contents   

Distributor charge-back accruals are based on the differentials
    between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower
    government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered
    under federally qualified programs. Distributor services
    accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the
    wholesale distributor for services provided. See Critical
    Accounting Policies for further discussion.

Gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related
    allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005 were as follows:

2007 compared to 2006 :  Sales return allowances
    decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to lower
    returns of
    ALKERAN   
    IV resulting from improved expiration dating on 2006 and 2007
    product sales. In addition,
    THALOMID   
    returns were lower than the prior year primarily due to a 2006
    THALOMID   
    returns initiative undertaken by one large retail pharmacy
    chain. In response to this initiative, we introduced single
    sleeves of
    THALOMID   
    for sale in June of 2006. Previously,
    THALOMID   
    was sold only in multi-sleeve package configurations. The
    additional trade package configuration enabled all retailers to
    more efficiently manage their
    THALOMID   
    inventories resulting in lower 2007 returns. This decrease was
    partly offset by current year
    THALOMID   
    returns, reflecting the impact of a 2007 inventory
    centralization and rationalization initiative conducted by
    several major pharmacy chains. Under this initiative, inventory
    was redistributed amongst individual chain stores in a
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    compliant manner. This resulted in an increase in
    THALOMID   
    returns as these major pharmacy chains more effectively managed
    their inventory levels at the chain stores.

Discounts increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to
    increased sales of
    REVLIMID   .

Medicaid rebate allowances increased in 2007 compared to 2006
    due to increased sales of
    REVLIMID   
    as well as price increases for both
    THALOMID   
    and
    REVLIMID   .
    Our Medicaid rebate accruals are based on the Medicaid Unit
    Rebate Amount formula established by the Center for Medicaid and
    Medicare Services using the estimated Medicaid dispense
    quantities.
    REVLIMID   
    dispenses increased resulting from the introduction of the 15mg
    and 25mg strength tablets.

37

Table of Contents   

Distributor chargebacks increased in 2007 compared to 2006
    primarily due to
    REVLIMID   ,
    THALOMID   
    and
    ALKERAN   
    IV price increases, which increased the differential between
    annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare
    providers and our wholesale acquisition cost.

2006 compared to 2005 :  Sales returns
    allowances increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to
    unusually high
    THALOMID   
    returns from one specific large retail pharmacy chain, which
    occurred during the first half of 2006. The returns from this
    customer were the results of its efforts to more aggressively
    manage inventory, our package configuration which required
    pharmacies to purchase full cartons of up to ten sleeves of
    THALOMID   
    capsules with each order and S.T.E.P.S.
       related
    restrictions, which limited the customer s ability to
    transfer inventories between its locations. For the past several
    years, we have experienced sales returns of approximately 4% of
    sales. As a result of the higher returns activity during the
    first half of 2006, we recorded additional allowances to
    increase our reserve to approximately 9% of all estimated
    THALOMID   
    pharmacy inventories. In addition, we introduced single sleeve
    units, beginning June 7, 2006 (rather than requiring full
    carton purchases) and we amended our product returns policy to
    include a product returns handling fee. These measures were
    designed to allow customers to more effectively manage their
    inventories, since they can now order smaller quantities, as
    well as limit our product returns exposure. To a lesser extent,
    the increase in sales returns allowances also resulted from
    higher returns of expired
    ALKERAN   
    IV product.

Sales discounts increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to
    higher net sales. Medicaid rebate allowances decreased in 2006,
    compared to 2005, primarily due to the impact of the new
    Medicare Part D legislation, which became effective
    January 1, 2006. As a result of the new legislation, many
    patients who had been eligible to receive
    THALOMID   
    through Medicaid coverage are now covered under Medicare
    Part D. Partially offsetting the
    THALOMID   
    decrease are Medicaid rebate allowances included in 2006 for
    REVLIMID   
    sales. Distributor chargebacks increased in 2006, compared to
    2005, primarily due to
    THALOMID   
    price increases, which increased the differential between annual
    contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare
    providers and our wholesale acquisition cost. Also contributing
    to the increase in distributor chargeback allowances was an
    increase in
    ALKERAN   
    IV sales to certain public health services contract eligible
    customers and accruals for
    REVLIMID   ,
    which was approved in the U.S. in December 2005.

Other
    Revenues:   

2007 compared to 2006:   Revenues from
    collaborative agreements and other sources totaled
    $20.1 million and $18.2 million for 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The $1.9 million increase in 2007 compared to
    2006 was primarily due to an increase in license fees generated
    from our
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    program and an increase in umbilical cord blood enrollment,
    collection and storage fees generated through our LifeBank USASM
    business.

Royalty revenue totaled $85.3 million in 2007, representing
    an increase of $16.2 million compared to 2006. The increase
    was primarily due to amounts received from Novartis on sales of
    their entire family of
    Ritalin   
    drugs and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  .

2006 compared to 2005:   Revenues from
    collaborative agreements and other sources totaled
    $18.2 million in 2006, compared to $41.3 million in
    2005. The $23.1 million decrease was primarily due to the
    inclusion in 2005 of a $20.0 million milestone payment
    received from Novartis relating to the FDA marketing approval
    for Focalin
    XR  tm  .

Royalty revenue totaled $69.1 million in 2006, representing
    an increase of $19.1 million compared to 2005. The increase
    was primarily due to amounts received from Novartis on their
    sales of FOCALIN
    XR  tm  .

    increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in
    REVLIMID   
    material costs and royalty payments related to both
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   
    as sales increased for these two products. The increase was
    partly offset by lower
    ALKERAN   
    material costs related to
    ALKERAN   
    for injection. As a percentage of net product sales, cost of
    goods sold decreased from 18.1% in 2005 and 15.5% in 2006 to
    10.0% in 2007 primarily due to the growth of
    REVLIMID   ,
    the product s lower cost relative to our other products and
    sales price increases.

2006 compared to 2005 :  Cost of goods sold was
    higher in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher
    ALKERAN   
    costs.
    ALKERAN   
    costs tend to experience variability depending on the purchase
    price of the specific units sold during a given period. Also
    contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold were higher
    royalties on
    THALOMID   
    which resulted from higher net sales and the inclusion of costs
    associated with
    REVLIMID   
    sales.

Research and Development:   Research and
    development expenses and related percentages for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

2007 compared to 2006 :  Research and
    development expenses increased by $140.0 million in 2007
    compared to 2006 primarily due to spending related to clinical
    research and development in support of multiple programs,
    including
    REVLIMID   
    and other
    IMiDs   
    across a broad range of cancers, including NHL and CLL. Expenses
    also increased to support ongoing research of other compounds,
    such as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and
    placental-derived stem/progenitor cell program. Regulatory
    spending increased primarily due to the expansion of
    REVLIMID   
    in international markets. The expense for 2007 also included a
    combined $41.1 million in collaborative research and
    development arrangements for early stage compounds with Array
    BioPharma Inc. and PTC Therapeutics.

In 2007, research and development expenses consisted of
    $137.7 million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical
    programs, including $41.1 million for collaborative
    research and development arrangements; $203.0 million spent
    on other pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology,
    analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality and
    regulatory affairs; $42.8 million spent on
    biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and
    $15.1 million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials
    programs. These expenditures support ongoing clinical progress
    in multiple proprietary development programs for
    REVLIMID   
    and
    THALOMID   ,
    and for other compounds such as: CC-10004, our lead
    anti-inflammatory compound that inhibits PDE-4, which results in
    the inhibition of multiple proinflammatory mediators such as
    TNF-  and which is currently being evaluated in
    Phase II clinical trials in the treatment of psoriasis and
    psoriatic arthritis; CC-4047, CC-11006 and CC-11050 which are
    currently either being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials or
    for which Phase II clinical trials are planned or ongoing;
    and our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs as well as the
    placental stem cell program.

2006 compared to 2005 :  Research and
    development expenses increased by $67.8 million in 2006
    compared to 2005, primarily due to spending related to clinical
    research and development; medical information and education
    expenses, which support educating and training the medical
    community on hematological cancers such as multiple myeloma and
    MDS; and ongoing development of a broad range of compounds and
    placental-derived stem cell programs.

In 2006, we spent $95.4 million on human pharmaceutical
    clinical programs; $109.1 million on other pharmaceutical
    programs, including toxicology, analytical research and
    development, drug discovery, quality and regulatory affairs;
    $40.8 million on biopharmaceutical discovery and
    development programs; and $13.3 million on placental stem
    cell and biomaterials programs.

Research and development expense may continue to grow as earlier
    stage compounds are moved through the preclinical and clinical
    stages. Due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties
    inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated
    with each of our research and development projects, the cost to
    complete such projects can vary. The data obtained from these
    tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation
    that could delay, limit or prevent a project s advancement
    through the various stages of clinical development, which would
    significantly impact the costs incurred to bring a project to
    completion.

For information about the commercial and development status and
    target diseases of our drug compounds, refer to the product
    overview table contained in Part I, Item I,
     Business,  of this Annual Report.

Selling, General and Administrative:   Selling,
    general and administrative expenses and related percentages for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as
    follows:

2007 compared to 2006 :  Selling, general and
    administrative expenses increased by $112.2 million in 2007
    compared to 2006, reflecting an increase in sales force costs
    related to
    REVLIMID   
    product launch activities in Europe and an increase in spending
    related to our continued expansion throughout Europe, Japan,
    Australia and Canada. Donations to non-profit foundations that
    assist patients with their co-payments also increased in 2007
    compared to 2006.

2006 compared to 2005 :  Selling, general and
    administrative expenses increased by $157.9 million in 2006
    compared to 2005 primarily due to $62.3 million of
    share-based compensation expense resulting from the application
    of SFAS 123R, which became effective January 1, 2006
    and a $63.8 million increase in commercial expenses related
    to
    REVLIMID   
    sales and marketing efforts in the United States. Spending
    related to the expansion of our U.S. and international
    organization and donations to non-profit foundations that assist
    patients with their co-payments also contributed to the expense
    increase.

Interest and investment income, net:   Interest
    and investment income, net and related percentages for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

Interest and investment income, net increased by
    $69.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher
    average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
    balances resulting from the November 2006 issuance of an
    additional 20,000,000 shares of our common stock, which
    generated net proceeds of $1.006 billion. The year ended
    December 31, 2007 included other-than-temporary impairment
    losses on marketable securities available for sale of
    $5.5 million.

40

Table of Contents   

Interest and investment income, net increased by
    $15.8 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the favorable
    impact of the November 2006 issuance of an additional
    20,000,000 shares of our common stock, increase in net
    realized gains from the sale of certain marketable securities
    and higher short-term interest rates. Included in 2006 and 2005
    were other-than-temporary impairment losses on marketable
    securities available for sale of $3.8 million and
    $3.1 million, respectively.

Equity in losses of affiliated
    companies:   Under the equity method of accounting,
    we recorded losses of $4.5 million, $8.2 million and
    $6.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    $3.7 million decrease in losses in 2007 compared to 2006
    was primarily due to our investment in EntreMed Inc., which
    included a charge of $3.1 million for in-process research
    and development related to EntreMed s acquisition of
    Miikana Therapeutics Inc. in 2006. The $1.3 million
    increase in losses in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to
    our share of losses from EntreMed.

Interest expense:   Interest expense was
    $11.1 million, $9.4 million and $9.5 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and primarily reflected
    interest and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the
    $400 million convertible notes issued on June 3, 2003.
    The $1.7 million increase in 2007 was due to the inclusion
    of a full year s interest on the note payable to Siegfried
    resulting from the December 2006 acquisition of the API
    manufacturing facility in Switzerland, and was partially offset
    by a decrease in interest on the convertible notes resulting
    from a substantial amount of conversions to common stock during
    the month of December 2007.

Other income (expense), net:   Other income
    (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005 were as follows:

The $7.9 million decrease in other income (expense), net in
    2007 compared to 2006 was partly due to a decrease in foreign
    exchange gains of $3.8 million.

Other income (expense), net increased by $13.0 million in
    2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in foreign
    exchange gains of $6.1 million and a $6.5 million
    decrease in losses in the estimated value of our investment in
    EntreMed warrants.

Income tax provision:   The income tax provision
    for 2007 was $290.5 million and reflects tax expense
    impacted by certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions
    outside the United States for which we do not presently receive
    a tax benefit and nondeductible expenses which include
    share-based compensation expense related to incentive stock
    options. The income tax provision for 2006 was
    $133.9 million and reflects tax expense impacted by certain
    expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the United
    States for which we do not presently receive a tax benefit and
    nondeductible expenses which include share-based compensation
    expense related to incentive stock options.

The income tax provision for 2005 was $20.6 million and
    reflects tax expense impacted by certain expenses incurred in
    taxing jurisdictions outside the United States for which we do
    not presently receive a tax benefit and non-deductible expenses.
    This was partially offset by the benefit from the elimination of
    valuation allowances totaling $42.6 million as of
    March 31, 2005, which was based on the fact that we
    determined it was more likely than not that certain benefits of
    our deferred tax assets would be realized.

Net income:   Net income and per common share
    amounts for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were as follows:

(1)  

Amounts have been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split
    effected in February 2006. 

(2)  

In computing diluted earnings per share, the numerator has been
    adjusted to add-back the after-tax amount of interest expense
    recognized in the year on our convertible debt. 

2007 compared to 2006:   Net income increased by
    $157.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an
    increase in total revenues, primarily from the sales of
    REVLIMID   ;
    increase in interest and investment income resulting from the
    issuance of an additional 20,000,000 shares of common stock
    in November 2006; decrease in the overall income tax rate from
    66% in 2006 to 56% in 2007; partially offset by increased
    operating expenses required to support organizational growth,
    research and development and the launch of
    REVLIMID   
    in Europe.

2006 compared to 2005:   Net income increased in
    2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in total
    revenues partially offset by $53.2 million of after-tax
    share-based compensation expense resulting from the application
    of SFAS 123R, which became effective January 1, 2006;
    inclusion in 2005 of the one-time benefit of $42.6 million
    recognized from the elimination of deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances; and higher operating expenses in 2006.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources  

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    as follows:

Operating Activities:   Net cash provided by
    operating activities increased in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily due to increased earnings, payables, accrued expenses
    and taxes payable.

Investing Activities:   Net cash used by
    investing activities in 2007 included $893.3 million from
    the net purchases of available-for-sale marketable securities,
    $64.4 million of capital expenditures and
    $23.4 million for purchases of investment securities. Net
    cash provided by investing activities in 2006 included
    $77.8 million from net sales of available-for-sale
    marketable securities, partially offset by $46.1 million of
    capital expenditures; $12.4 million for the purchase of an
    API manufacturing facility from Siegfried Ltd; $7.4 million
    for equity method investments; and $5.1 million for
    purchases of investment securities. For 2008, capital
    expenditures are estimated to be $120.0 million.

42

Table of Contents   

Financing Activities:   Net cash provided by
    financing activities in 2007 included $144.7 million of
    cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and
    the excess tax benefit recognized of $143.0 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 included
    $1.006 billion from our November 2006 public offering,
    wherein we issued an additional 20,000,000 shares of our
    common stock at a public offering price of $51.60 per share.
    Cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in
    2006 was $113.1 million and the excess tax benefit
    recognized was $102.0 million.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and working
    capital :  Working capital and cash, cash
    equivalents and marketable securities for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

(1)  

Includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,
    accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory, and other
    current assets, less accounts payable, accrued expenses, income
    taxes payable and other current liabilities. 

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable
    securities:   We invest our excess cash primarily
    in money market funds and in U.S. government debt,
    U.S. government agency debt, U.S. government-sponsored
    agency debt, and corporate debt. All liquid investments with
    maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are
    classified as cash equivalents and all investments with
    maturities of greater than three months from the date of
    purchase are classified as marketable securities. We determine
    the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable
    debt and equity securities at the time of purchase. The increase
    in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from
    December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 was primarily
    due to net cash provided from operations and proceeds from stock
    option exercises.

Accounts receivable, net:   Accounts receivable,
    net increased by $39.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due
    to increased sales. Days of sales outstanding in 2007 improved
    by approximately four days compared to 2006. Accounts
    receivable, net increased $49.9 million in 2006 compared to
    2005 due to higher net sales, which reflected the launch of
    REVLIMID   
    in the United States.

Inventory:   Inventory in 2007 increased
    $23.7 million compared to 2006 primarily due to an
    increases in
    REVLIMID   
    inventories, resulting from the product s introduction in
    international markets.

Other current assets:   Other current assets
    increased $21.0 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily
    due to an increase in prepaid foreign sales and use taxes
    and the inclusion of Pharmion deferred merger costs in 2007.

Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current
    liabilities :  Accounts payable, accrued expenses
    and other current liabilities increased $76.5 million in
    2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in accruals for
    clinical trial costs and an increase in sales return accruals.

Income taxes payable:   Income taxes payable
    increased $131.4 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily
    from provisions for income taxes of $290.5 million offset
    by a tax benefit on stock option exercises of
    $159.3 million.

We expect that combined spending for research and development,
    international expansion, commercialization of products and
    capital investments will remain at a high level. However, we
    anticipate that existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable
    securities available for sale, combined with cash received from
    expected net product sales and revenues from various research,
    collaboration and royalty agreements, will provide sufficient
    capital resources to fund our operations for the foreseeable
    future.

Contractual
    Obligations  

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of
    December 31, 2007:

Convertible Debt:   In June 2003, we issued an
    aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured
    convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five-year term
    and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi-annually. The
    convertible notes outstanding at December 31, 2007 can be
    converted at any time into 16,227,441 shares of common
    stock at a stock-split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per
    share. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the
    remaining convertible notes outstanding exceeded their carrying
    value of $196.6 million by $514.4 million (for more
    information refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements).

Operating leases:   We lease office and research
    facilities under various operating lease agreements in the
    United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and Singapore.
    The non-cancelable lease terms for the operating leases expire
    at various dates between 2008 and 2016 and include renewal
    options. In general, we are also required to reimburse the
    lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance
    and other operating costs associated with the leases. For more
    information on the major facilities that we occupy under lease
    arrangements refer to Part I, Item 2,
     Properties .

ALKERAN   
    Purchase Commitment:   In March 2003, we entered
    into a supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline,
    or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell
    ALKERAN   
    (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative
    treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under
    the terms of the agreement, we purchase
    ALKERAN   
    tablets and
    ALKERAN   
    for infusion from GSK and distribute the products in the United
    States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires us to
    purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a
    take-or-pay arrangement. The agreement has been extended through
    March 31, 2009. On December 31, 2007, the remaining
    minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled
    $38.2 million.

Manufacturing Facility Note Payable:   In
    December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and
    certain other assets and liabilities from Siegfried located in
    Zofingen, Switzerland. The assets were purchased for a
    U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately
    $46.0 million, consisting of a payment of approximately
    $12.4 million at the closing, $3.4 million payable in
    each of the first five following years and $3.3 million in
    each of the subsequent five years. The transaction included a
    technical service agreement which allows us to retain the
    necessary support to operate the plant. At December 31,
    2007, the remaining commitment based on year-end exchange rates
    was a U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately
    $32.1 million, which includes imputed interest.

Other Contract Commitments:   In connection with
    the acquisition of Penn T on October 21, 2004, we entered
    into a five-year minimum period Technical Services Agreement
    with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, or PPSL, and Penn
    Pharmaceutical Holding Limited under which PPSL provides the
    services and facilities necessary for the manufacture of
    THALOMID   
    and other thalidomide formulations. At December 31, 2007,
    the remaining costs to be incurred was approximately
    $4.5 million.

We have committed to invest $20.0 million in an investment
    fund over a ten-year period, which is callable at any time. On
    December 31, 2007, our remaining investment commitment was
    $17.0 million. For

more information refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

Other contract commitments at December 31, 2007 also
    include $3.6 million of various contractual obligations.

Income Taxes Payable:   We have provided a
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various
    federal, state and foreign income tax matters of
    $211.3 million, at December 31, 2007. The timing of
    the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at
    December 31, 2007. The Company does not expect a settlement
    within the next twelve months.

New
    Accounting Principles  

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 155,  Accounting for Certain Hybrid
    Financial Instruments   an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 133 and 140,  or SFAS 155, which
    permits a fair value re-measurement for any hybrid financial
    instrument containing an embedded derivative that would
    otherwise require bifurcation. We have adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 155 effective January 1, 2007 and have determined
    that it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    or FIN 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes   an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s
    financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
     Accounting for Income Taxes,  and prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 had no
    cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption. Refer to
    Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

On May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
     FIN 48-1, 
    or FSP
     FIN 48-1, 
     Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48.  FSP
     FIN 48-1 
    provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether
    a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of
    recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. We
    retroactively adopted the provisions of FSP
     FIN 48-1 
    effective January 1, 2007 and have determined that it had
    no impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
     Fair Value Measurements,  which establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. The FASB partially deferred the
    effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis while the
    effective date for nonfinancial and financial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized on a recurring basis is
    effective beginning January 1, 2008. We have determined
    that the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF Issue
     No. 00-19-2, 
     Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements,  or
     FSP 00-19-2, 
    which addresses an issuer s accounting for registration
    payment arrangements.
     FSP 00-19-2 
    specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included
    as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement,
    should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5,  Accounting for Contingencies. 
     FSP 00-19-2 
    was issued in December 2006 and was effective immediately for
    registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments
    subject to those arrangements that were entered into or modified
    subsequent to the issuance of
     FSP 00-19-2. 
    For registration payment arrangements and financial instruments
    subject to those arrangements entered into prior to the issuance
    of
     FSP 00-19-2, 
    it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006. We have adopted the
    provisions of
     FSP 00-19-2 
    effective

45

Table of Contents   

January 1, 2007 and have determined that the adoption had
    no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to
    Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities,  or SFAS 159, which provides companies
    with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. SFAS 159 establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between companies that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and
    highlights the effect of a company s choice to use fair
    value on its earnings. It also requires a company to display the
    fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has
    chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet.
    SFAS 159 will be effective for us beginning January 1,
    2008 and is not expected to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force, or
    EITF, Issue
     No. 07-3, 
     Accounting for Non-Refundable Advance Payments for Goods
    or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
    Activities,  or
     EITF 07-3, 
    which provides that non-refundable advance payments for future
    research and development activities should be deferred and
    capitalized until the related goods are delivered or the related
    services are performed.
     EITF 07-3 
    will be effective for us on a prospective basis beginning
    January 1, 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue
     No. 07-1, 
     Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the
    Development and Commercialization of Intellectual
    Property,  or
     EITF 07-1, 
    which provides guidance on how the parties to a collaborative
    agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue
    generated on sales to third parties, how sharing payments
    pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the
    income statement and certain related disclosure requirements.
     EITF 07-1 
    will be effective for us beginning January 2009 on a
    retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of
    the adoption of
     EITF 07-1 
    will have, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies  

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to
    the portrayal of our financial condition and results of
    operation and requires management s most difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need
    to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
    inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies
    are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual
    Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be
    critical:

Revenue Recognition on Collaboration
    Agreements:   We have formed collaborative research
    and development agreements and alliances with several
    pharmaceutical companies. These agreements are in the form of
    research and development and license agreements. The agreements
    call for nonrefundable upfront payments, milestone payments on
    achieving significant milestone events, and in some cases
    ongoing research funding. The agreements also contemplate
    royalty payments on sales if and when the compounds receive
    regulatory marketing approval.

Our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront
    license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with
    the guidance provided in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission s Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial
    Statements,  as amended by SAB No. 104,
     Revenue Recognition,  or SAB 104. In addition,
    we follow the provisions of EITF Issue
     No. 00-21, 
     Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,  or
     EITF 00-21, 
    for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially amended after June 30, 2003.
     EITF 00-21 
    provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that
    involves multiple revenue-generating activities or deliverables
    should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue
    recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the
    arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate
    units of accounting. If the deliverables in a revenue
    arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to
    the EITF s separation criteria, the revenue recognition
    policy must be determined for each identified unit. If the
    arrangement is a single unit of accounting, the revenue
    recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement.

Under arrangements where the license fees and research and
    development activities can be accounted for as a separate unit
    of accounting, nonrefundable upfront license fees are deferred
    and recognized as revenue on

46

Table of Contents   

a straight-line basis over the expected term of our continued
    involvement in the research and development process. Revenues
    from the achievement of research and development milestones, if
    deemed substantive, are recognized as revenue when the
    milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and
    collectible. Milestones are considered substantive if all of the
    following conditions are met: (1) the milestone is
    nonrefundable; (2) achievement of the milestone was not
    reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement;
    (3) substantive effort is involved to achieve the
    milestone; and (4) the amount of the milestone appears
    reasonable in relation to the effort expended, the other
    milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated
    with achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions
    are not met, we would recognize a proportionate amount of the
    milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that correlates to
    work already performed and the remaining portion of the
    milestone payment will be deferred and recognized as revenue as
    we complete our performance obligations.

Gross to Net Sales Accruals for Sales Returns, Medicaid
    Rebates and Chargebacks:   Our gross to net sales
    accruals for Sales Returns, Medicaid Rebates and Chargebacks are
    based on our sales
     and/or 
    estimates of third-party inventories. Our accrual methodologies
    are described in more detail below.

THALOMID   
    is distributed under our
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    distribution program. Among other things,
    S.T.E.P.S.   ,
    which is a proprietary comprehensive education and
    risk-management distribution program, requires prescribers,
    patients and dispensing pharmacies to participate in a registry
    and prohibits the filling of a
    THALOMID   
    order unless the physician, patient and pharmacy have all
    obtained an appropriate authorization number. Automatic refills
    are not permitted under the program. Each prescription may not
    exceed a
     28-day 
    supply and a new prescription is required with each order.
    Although we invoice through traditional pharmaceutical
    wholesalers, all
    THALOMID   
    orders are drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy
    overnight. Wholesaler stocking of this product is prohibited. In
    addition, we do not offer commercial discounts on our products
    to pharmacies or hospitals and, therefore, have no commercial
    distributor chargebacks.

REVLIMID   
    is distributed under the
    RevAssist   
    program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution
    program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of
    REVLIMID   ,
    and is sold primarily through contracted pharmacies lending
    itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the
    supply channel. The
    RevAssist   
    program includes most of the same attributes of the
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    program mentioned above.

ALKERAN   
    is distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical
    industry supply chain.
    ALKERAN   
    is not subjected to
    S.T.E.P.S.   
    or
    RevAssist   
    distribution restrictions. It may be stocked by multiple
    wholesalers and prescribed by physicians without our
    preauthorization.

Sales Returns:   We base our sales returns
    allowance, which primarily relates to
    THALOMID   ,
    on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, actual returns
    history and other known factors, such as the trend experience
    for lots where product is still being returned and inventory
    centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by
    major pharmacy chains. If the historical data we use to
    calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future
    returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the
    period in which such a determination is made and revenues in
    that period could be materially affected. Under this
    methodology, we track actual returns by individual production
    lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible
    for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns
    experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible
    for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical
    return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates
    are considered in determining the current sales return
    allowance. We do not use information from external sources in
    estimating our product returns. As indicated above,
    THALOMID   
    is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a
    result, wholesalers do not stock the product.
    REVLIMID   
    is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending
    itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the
    supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity to
    date.

External factors such as price changes from competitors and
    introductions of new and generic competing products could have
    an impact on our sales returns. Our sales returns have not been
    impacted thus far by such external factors; however, we continue
    to monitor such factors. Our sales returns allowances were
    $39.8 million, $54.6 million and $21.3 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which equates to an accrual
    rate of

47

Table of Contents   

2.7%, 5.7% and 3.9% of gross product sales in each of the three
    respective years. A 10% increase in our 2007 returns rate would
    have resulted in a $4.0 million decrease in our 2007
    reported revenue.

Medicaid Rebates:   Our Medicaid rebate accruals
    are computed using the Medicaid rebate formula established by
    the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This formula
    establishes a quarterly Unit Rebate Amount (URA) for eligible
    drugs based on our quarterly average manufacturers price (AMP).
    We apply the calculated AMP to estimated quarterly Medicaid
    dispense quantities for our products. Actual Medicaid dispense
    quantities are reported by individual states on a
     45-60 day 
    quarter-end lag. Differences in Medicaid rebate accruals
    resulting from differences in the estimated Medicaid dispense
    quantities and actual Medicaid dispense quantities are adjusted
    in the following period. The URA calculation allows for
    manufacturer price increases based on increases in the Consumer
    Price Index-All Urban Consumers. Price increases in excess of
    the allowable Medicaid increase result in a higher unit rebate
    amount. Our Medicaid rebate allowances increased in 2007
    compared to 2006 due primarily to increased sales of
    REVLIMID   
    as well as price increases for both
    THALOMID   
    and
    REVLIMID   
    above the allowable Medicaid increase.

Distributor Chargebacks:   As indicated above,
    we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to
    pharmacies or hospitals and, therefore, have no commercial
    distributor chargebacks. Our distributor chargebacks result from
    the difference between prices paid by the wholesaler to acquire
    our products and the lower prices the wholesaler is legally
    obligated to extend to federally funded healthcare providers
    such as Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense entities as
    well as non-federal PHS/340B entities. We estimate distributor
    chargeback allowances at the time of sale based on the
    pharmacies to which the order was drop-shipped and its
    eligibility for the lower pricing. Actual chargeback credits
    claimed by the wholesaler may significantly differ from our
    accruals.
    THALOMID   
    chargeback allowances are more sensitive to current price
    changes due to the cumulative increase to the
    THALOMID   
    wholesale acquisition price since its initial commercial launch
    date.
    REVLIMID   
    chargeback allowances are less sensitive to current wholesale
    acquisition cost price increases due to its relatively recent
    commercial launch date.

Other Gross to Net Sales Accruals:   We record
    sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to
    customers and we record distributor services accruals based on
    contractual fees incurred for the wholesale distributor services
    provided.

Income Taxes:   We utilize the asset and
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
    method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
    on the difference between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences
    are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when
    it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be
    realized.

Our 2007 effective tax rate is approximately 56.2%. The
    effective tax rate exceeds the statutory tax rate primarily due
    to certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the
    United States for which we do not presently receive a tax
    benefit and nondeductible expenses which include share-based
    compensation expense related to incentive stock options. We
    operate under an incentive tax holiday in Switzerland that
    expires in 2015 and exempts us from certain Swiss taxes.
    Likewise, expenses currently being incurred in Switzerland do
    not provide a tax benefit. To the extent we receive approvals in
    markets outside the United States, and manufacture and generate
    taxable income subject to our Swiss tax holiday, we would expect
    our effective tax rate to be lower in the future.

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 and FSP
     FIN 48-1 
    effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    enterprise s financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, 
    and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute
    for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. We had no cumulative effect
    adjustment related to the adoption. We account for interest and
    penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our
    provision for income taxes. These unrecognized tax benefits
    relate primarily to issues common among multinational
    corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of
    methodologies in making these estimates which include studies
    performed by independent economists, advice from industry and
    subject experts, evaluation of public

48

Table of Contents   

actions taken by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing
    authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide
    estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. If our estimates are
    not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be
    materially impacted.

At March 31, 2005, we determined it was more likely than
    not that we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize
    the benefits of our deferred tax assets and, as a result,
    eliminated certain deferred tax valuation allowances, which
    resulted in us recording an income tax benefit in 2005 of
    $42.6 million and an increase to additional paid-in capital
    of $30.2 million. The decision to eliminate the deferred
    tax valuation allowances was based on an external Independent
    Data Monitoring Committee s, or IDMC, analysis of two
    Phase III Special Protocol Assessment multiple myeloma
    trials and the conclusion that these trials exceeded the
    pre-specified stopping rule. The IDMC found a statistically
    significant improvement in time to disease
    progression   the primary endpoint of these
    Phase III trials   in patients receiving
    REVLIMID   
    plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone
    alone. This, in concert with our nine consecutive quarters of
    profitability, led to the conclusion that it was more likely
    than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income to
    realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets.

We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of
    deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these
    deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we
    believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors
    when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred
    tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience
    by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income,
    carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,
    various income tax strategies and other relevant factors.
    Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and,
    to the extent future expectations change, we would have to
    assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that
    time. At December 31, 2007, it was more likely than not
    that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation
    allowances.

Share-Based Compensation:   We adopted the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  or
    SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006, which requires
    that all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the
    financial statements at their fair values. We adopted
    SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method
    under which the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards
    and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the
    adoption date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
    estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which
    requires certain estimates to be made by management including
    the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options.
    Management also makes decisions regarding the method of
    calculating the expected volatilities and the risk-free interest
    rate used in the model. Fluctuations in the market that affect
    these estimates could have an impact on the resulting
    compensation cost. Additionally, compensation cost for the
    portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been
    rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is
    recognized over the remaining service period after the adoption
    date (for additional information refer to Note 13 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
    Annual Report).

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Available-For-Sale
    Marketable Securities:  A decline in the market value of any
    available-for-sale marketable security below its cost that is
    deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in
    carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to
    operations and a new cost basis for the security established.
    The determination of whether an available-for-sale marketable
    security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires significant
    judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative
    and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment.
    Factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is
    other-than-temporarily impaired include: significant
    deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance, credit
    rating, asset quality, business prospects of the issuer, adverse
    changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer
    operates, length of time that the fair value has been below our
    cost, our expected future cash flows from the security and our
    intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient
    period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the
    investment. Assumptions associated with these factors are
    subject to future market and economic conditions, which could
    differ from our assessment. During 2007 and 2006, we determined
    that certain securities had sustained other-than-temporary
    impairments and, as a result, we recognized impairment losses of
    $5.5 million and $3.8 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which were recorded in interest and investment
    income, net.

Investment in Affiliated Companies:   Our
    investment in affiliated companies includes an investment in
    EntreMed which had a carrying value of $12.2 million and a
    fair value of $12.4 million at December 31, 2007. If
    the carrying value of our investment were to exceed its fair
    value, we would review it to determine if an
    other-than-temporary decline in value of the investment has been
    sustained. If the investment is determined to have sustained an
    other-than-temporary decline in value, the investment will be
    written-down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is judgmental
    and dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors
    that we consider in determining whether an other-than-temporary
    decline in value has occurred include: the market value of the
    security in relation to its cost basis, the period of time that
    the market value is below cost, the financial condition of the
    investee and our intent and ability to retain the investment for
    a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market
    value of the investment. We evaluate information that we are
    aware of in addition to quoted market prices, if any, in
    determining if an other-than-temporary decline in value exists.

Accounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans:   We
    have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed
    to provide key officers and executives with performance-based
    incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of
    pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a
    three-year period. We currently have three three-year
    performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31,
    2008, 2009 and 2010. The 2008 performance cycle was approved by
    the Management Compensation and Development Committee of the
    Board of Directors in February 2008 and began on January 1,
    2008 with an ending date of December 31, 2010. Performance
    measures for each LTIP are based on the following components in
    the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on earnings per
    share, 25% on net income and 50% on revenue.

Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the
    participant s salary for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 plans. The
    estimated payout for the concluded 2007 cycle is
    $6.2 million and the maximum potential payout, assuming
    objectives are achieved at the maximum level for the 2008, 2009
    and 2010 cycles, are $6.4 million, $8.0 million and
    $10.0 million, respectively. Such awards are payable in
    cash or, at our discretion, in our common stock based upon our
    stock price at the payout date. We accrue the long-term
    incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end
    of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of
    our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in
    control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment
    equal to their target award, or, if higher, an award based on
    actual performance through the date of the change in control.
    For 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized expense related to the
    LTIP of $6.9 million, $4.6 million and
    $4.4 million, respectively.

Accruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions
    concerning future earnings per share, net income and revenues,
    the actual results of which could be materially different than
    the assumptions used. Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a
    regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability
    recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts. In
    estimating the accruals, management considers actual results to
    date for the performance period, expected results for the
    remainder of the performance period, operating trends, product
    development, pricing and competition.

ITEM 7A.      

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative
    and qualitative information about our potential exposure to
    market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising
    from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The
    risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse
    changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings.

We have established guidelines relative to the diversification
    and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity.
    These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified
    depending on market conditions. Although investments may be
    subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit
    quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of
    credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of
    investment. At December 31, 2007, our market risk sensitive
    instruments consisted of derivatives, marketable securities
    available for sale, unsecured convertible notes issued by us and
    our notes payable to Siegfried.

Derivatives:   We periodically utilize forward
    contracts to economically hedge non-functional currency
    exposures. At December 31, 2007, we had foreign currency
    forward contracts outstanding to hedge non-

50

Table of Contents   

functional currency assets denominated in Swiss Francs, British
    Pounds, Japanese Yen and U.S. dollars. The aggregate
    notional amount of these contracts was $43.1 million and
    they expire within one year. The contracts are hedges of
    receivables at U.K. and Swiss foreign entities and are
    remeasured through earnings each period along with the
    underlying hedged item. At December 31, 2007, the net
    unrealized gain on the forward contracts was approximately
    $0.1 million in the aggregate.

Although not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 10%
    threshold reflects a reasonably possible near-term change in
    foreign currency rates. Assuming that the year-end exchange
    rates were to adversely change by a hypothetical 10% decrease in
    the underlying currencies, the fair value of the contracts would
    decrease by approximately $7.6 million. However, since the
    contracts hedge assets denominated in currencies other than the
    entity s functional currency, any change in the fair value
    of the contract would be offset by a change in the underlying
    value of the hedged items.

Marketable Securities Available for Sale:   At
    December 31, 2007, our marketable securities available for
    sale consisted of U.S. Treasury securities,
    U.S. government-sponsored agency securities,
    mortgage-backed obligations, corporate debt securities and
    1,939,598 shares of Pharmion Corporation common stock.
    Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair
    value, held for an unspecified period of time and intended for
    use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and
    losses on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be
    temporary, are reported as a separate component of
    stockholders  equity, net of tax. The cost of debt
    securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
    accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with
    realized gains and losses, is included in interest and
    investment income, net.

As of December 31, 2007, the principal amounts, fair values
    and related weighted average interest rates of our investments
    in debt securities classified as marketable securities
    available-for-sale were as follows:

Pharmion Common Stock:   At December 31,
    2007, we held a total of 1,939,598 shares of Pharmion
    Corporation common stock, which had an estimated fair value of
    approximately $121.9 million (based on the closing price
    reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers
    Automated Quotations, or NASDAQ), and, which exceeded the cost
    by approximately $101.7 million. The amount by which the
    fair value exceeded the cost (i.e., the unrealized gain) was
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
    stockholders  equity section of the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. The fair value of the Pharmion common stock investment is
    subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease
    in Pharmion s common stock quoted market price will have a
    similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our
    investment (Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the
    proposed merger with Pharmion).

Convertible Debt:   In June 2003, we issued an
    aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured
    convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five-year term
    and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi-annually. The
    convertible notes outstanding at December 31, 2007 can be
    converted at any time into 16,227,441 shares of common
    stock at a stock-split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per
    share (for more information refer to Note 9 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31,
    2007, the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the
    carrying value of $196.6 million by approximately
    $514.4 million, which we believe reflects the increase in
    the market price of our common stock to $46.21 per share as of
    December 31, 2007. Assuming other factors are held
    constant, an increase in interest rates generally results in a
    decrease in the fair value of fixed-rate convertible debt, but
    does not impact the carrying value, and an increase in our stock
    price generally results in an increase in the fair value of
    convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value.

Note Payable:   At December 31, 2007, the
    fair value of our note payable to Siegfried approximated the
    carrying value of the note of $26.2 million. Assuming other
    factors are held constant, an increase in interest rates
    generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the
    note. The fair value of the note will also be affected by
    changes in the U.S. dollar / Swiss franc exchange
    rate. The note is denominated in Swiss francs.

CONCLUSION
    REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND
    PROCEDURES  

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
     Rules 13a-15(e) 
    and
     15d-15(e)). 
    Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
    is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to our management (including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosures. Based on such evaluation, our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that we are in compliance with
     Rule 13a-15(e) 
    of the Exchange Act.

MANAGEMENT S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of our principal
    executive and principal financial officers and effected by our
    Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;
    (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In connection with the preparation of our annual consolidated
    financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework. Management s
    assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal
    control over financial reporting and testing of the operational
    effectiveness of those controls.

Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that
    audited our consolidated financial statements included in this
    report, has issued their report on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, a
    copy of which is included herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Celgene Corporation:

We have audited Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries 
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, or COSO. Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries 
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management s Report On
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Celgene
    Corporation and subsidiaries  internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated
    Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
    stockholders  equity for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report
    dated February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Celgene Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders 
    equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    consolidated financial statement schedule,
     Schedule II   Valuation and Qualifying
    Accounts.  These consolidated financial statements and
    consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility
    of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 1, 13 and 16 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes,  on January 1, 2007 and
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
     Share-Based Payment,  on January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19,
    2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of
    the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Nature of
    Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies  

Nature of Business and Basis of
    Presentation:   Celgene Corporation and its
    subsidiaries (collectively  Celgene  or the
     Company ) is a global biopharmaceutical company
    primarily engaged in the discovery, development and
    commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat
    cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. The Company s
    commercial stage products include
    REVLIMID   ,
    THALOMID   ,
    ALKERAN   
    and
    FOCALIN  tm  .
    FOCALIN  tm  
    is sold exclusively to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. The
    Company also derives revenues from a licensing agreement with
    Novartis which entitles it to royalties on FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    and the entire
    RITALIN   
    family of drugs; a licensing and product supply agreement with
    Pharmion Corp. for its sales of thalidomide; and sales of
    bio-therapeutic products and services through its Cellular
    Therapeutics subsidiary.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries. All inter-company
    transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in
    limited partnerships and interests where we have an equity
    interest of 50% or less and do not otherwise have a controlling
    financial interest are accounted for by either the equity or
    cost method. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
    to conform to the current year s presentation.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. The Company is subject to certain
    risks and uncertainties related to product development,
    regulatory approval, market acceptance, scope of patent and
    proprietary rights, intense competition, rapid technological
    change and product liability.

Financial Instruments:   Certain financial
    instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (e.g.,
    cash, cash equivalents, account receivable, certain other
    assets, accounts payable and certain other liabilities) are
    recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their
    short-term nature. The fair values of financial instruments
    other than marketable securities are determined through a
    combination of management estimates and information obtained
    from third parties using the latest market data. The fair value
    of available-for-sale marketable securities is based on quoted
    market prices. The carrying value of the note payable to
    Siegfried was $26.2 million at December 31, 2007 and
    approximated its fair value. The fair values of the following
    financial instruments are disclosed in the following footnotes:
    marketable securities (Note 4); EntreMed, Inc. common stock
    (Note 7); and convertible debt (Note 9).

Derivative Instruments:   The Company
    periodically utilizes forward contracts to economically hedge
    non-functional currency exposures. At December 31, 2007,
    the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
    to hedge non-functional currency assets denominated in Swiss
    Francs, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and U.S. dollars. The
    aggregate notional amount of these contracts was
    $43.1 million and they expire within one year. The
    contracts are hedges of receivables at U.K. and Swiss foreign
    entities and are remeasured through operations each period. At
    December 31, 2007, the net unrealized gain on the forward
    contracts was approximately $0.1 million in the aggregate.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available
    for Sale:   We invest our excess cash in money
    market funds and in highly liquid debt instruments, including
    U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored
    agency securities, mortgage-backed obligations, corporate debt
    securities, and 1,939,598 shares of Pharmion common stock.
    Investments with maturities of three months or less from the
    date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and
    investments with maturities of greater than three months from
    date of purchase are classified as marketable securities
    available for sale. Marketable securities available for sale are
    carried at fair value, held for an indefinite period of time and
    intended for use in meeting the Company s ongoing liquidity
    needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
    securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a
    separate component of stockholders  equity, net of tax. The
    cost of debt securities

F-7

Table of Contents   

Celgene
    Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements   (Continued)  

is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
    discounts to maturity. The amortization and accretion, along
    with realized gains and losses, is included in interest and
    investment income, net.

A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security
    below its carrying value that is determined to be
    other-than-temporary would result in a charge to earnings and
    decrease in the security s carrying value to its newly
    established fair value. Factors evaluated to determine if an
    investment is other-than-temporarily impaired include
    significant deterioration in earnings performance, credit
    rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the issuer;
    adverse changes in the general market condition in which the
    issuer operates; the intent and ability to retain the investment
    for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the
    market value of the investment; and, issues that raise concerns
    about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern.

Concentration of Credit Risk:   Cash, cash
    equivalents, and marketable securities are financial instruments
    that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit
    risk. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in
    U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored
    agency securities, mortgage-backed obligations and corporate
    debt securities with high credit ratings. The Company may also
    invest in unrated or below investment grade securities, such as
    equity in private companies. The Company has established
    guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to
    maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed
    periodically and may be modified to react to changes in market
    risk and take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.

The Company sells
    THALOMID    
     and
    ALKERAN    
     primarily through wholesale distributors and
    REVLIMID    
     primarily to specialty pharmacies; therefore, wholesale
    distributors account for a large portion of the Company s
    trade receivables and net product revenues (refer to
    Note 18). In light of this concentration, the Company
    continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and
    has internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The
    Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
    the credit worthiness of its customers, aging of receivable
    balances and general economic conditions.

Inventory:   Inventories are recorded at the
    lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a
     first-in, 
    first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews the
    composition of inventory in order to identify obsolete,
    slow-moving or otherwise unsaleable items. If unsaleable items
    are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory,
    the Company will record a write-down to net realizable value in
    the period that the decline in value is first recognized.
    Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production
    of preclinical and clinical products, which are charged to
    research and development expense when consumed.

Property, Plant and Equipment:   Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation of plant and equipment is recorded using the
    straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
    over the lesser of the economic useful life of the asset or the
    remaining term of the lease, including anticipated renewal
    options. The estimated useful lives of plant and equipment are
    as follows:

Buildings

40 years

Building and operating equipment

15 years

Manufacturing machinery and equipment

10 years

Machinery and equipment

5 years

Furniture and fixtures

5 years

Computer equipment and software

3-5 years

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred,
    while expenditures for improvements which extend the life of an
    asset are capitalized.

Investment in Affiliated Companies:   At
    December 31, 2007, the Company held 10,364,864 shares
    of EntreMed, Inc. common stock, representing an ownership
    interest of approximately 12.2% in EntreMed. The Company also
    holds 3,350,000 shares of EntreMed voting preferred shares
    that are convertible into

F-8

Table of Contents   

Celgene
    Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements   (Continued)  

16,750,000 shares of common stock and therefore, the
    Company determined that it has the ability to exercise
    significant influence over EntreMed and therefore, applies the
    equity method of accounting to its common stock investment. The
    Company also applies the equity method of accounting for its
    investment in an investment fund which invests in
     start-up 
    companies conducting business in life sciences such as
    biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, devices,
    diagnostics and health and wellness.

Equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible
    impairment. If an investment s fair value is determined to
    be less than its net carrying value and the decline is
    determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written
    down to its newly established fair value. Such an evaluation is
    judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances.
    Factors considered in determining whether an
    other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include:
    market value of the investment based on either market-quoted
    prices or future rounds of financing by the investee; length of
    time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial
    condition and business prospects of the investee; the
    Company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a
    sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value
    of the investment; any other information that the Company may be
    aware of related to the investment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:   Goodwill
    represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net
    assets acquired in an acquisition accounted for by the purchase
    method of accounting and is not amortized, but subject to
    impairment testing at least annually. Intangible assets with
    definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual
    values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for
    impairment if certain events occur as described below.

The Company s intangible assets consist of supply
    agreements, contract-based licenses, technology and an acquired
    workforce. Remaining amortization periods related to these
    categories range from 4 to 13 years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:   Long-lived
    assets, such as property, plant and equipment, software costs
    and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed
    for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
    recoverable.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to
    the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
    generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets
    exceed their estimated future undiscounted net cash flows, an
    impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the
    assets. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented
    in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of
    their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell, and are
    no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal
    group classified as held for sale would be presented separately
    in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the
    consolidated balance sheet.

Foreign Currency Translation:   Operations in
     non-U.S. entities 
    are recorded in the functional currency of each entity. For
    financial reporting purposes, the functional currency of an
    entity is determined by a review of the source of an
    entity s most predominant cash flows. The results of
    operations for
     non-U.S. entities 
    are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars
    using the average currency rate during each period, which
    approximates the results that would be obtained using actual
    currency rates on the dates of individual transactions. Assets
    and liabilities are translated using currency rates at the end
    of the period. Adjustments resulting from translating the
    financial statements of the Company s foreign entities into
    the U.S. dollar are excluded from the determination of net
    income and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive
    income. Transaction gains and losses are recorded as incurred in
    other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Research and Development Costs:   Research and
    development costs are expensed as incurred. These include all
    internal costs, external costs related to services contracted by
    the Company and research services conducted for others. Upfront
    and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with
    research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred
    up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone

F-9

Celgene
    Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements   (Continued)  

payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval
    are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of
    the related product.

Income Taxes:   The Company utilizes the asset
    and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
    method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
    on the difference between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences
    are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when
    it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a
    deferred tax asset will not be realized. Research and
    development tax credits are recognized as a reduction of the
    provision for income taxes when realized. The Company recognizes
    the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or
    expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax
    position is more likely than not to be sustained. Prior to 2007,
    the Company recognized the benefit of certain tax positions it
    had taken or expected to take on income tax returns it filed if
    such positions were probable of being sustained.

Revenue Recognition:   Revenue from the sale of
    products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the
    product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for
    discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and
    distributor charge-backs under terms customary in the industry
    are provided for in the same period the related sales are
    recorded. Provisions recorded in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled
    approximately $166.4 million, $153.5 million and
    $103.2 million, respectively.

We base our sales returns allowance, which primarily relates to
    THALOMID   ,
    on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, actual returns
    history and other known factors, such as the trend experience
    for lots where product is still being returned and inventory
    centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by
    major pharmacy chains. If the historical data we use to
    calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future
    returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the
    period in which such a determination is made and revenues in
    that period could be materially affected. Under this
    methodology, we track actual returns by individual production
    lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible
    for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns
    experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible
    for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical
    return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates
    are considered in determining the current sales return
    allowance. We do not use information from external sources in
    estimating our product returns.
    THALOMID   
    is drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a
    result, wholesalers do not stock the product.
    REVLIMID   
    is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending
    itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the
    supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity to
    date.

Revenue under research contracts is recorded as earned under the
    contracts, as services are provided. In accordance with SEC
    Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 104,
     Revenue Recognition,  upfront nonrefundable fees
    associated with license and development agreements where the
    Company has continuing involvement in the agreement, are
    recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated
    service period of the last item of performance to be delivered.
    If the estimated service period is subsequently modified, the
    period over which the up-front fee is recognized is modified
    accordingly on a prospective basis.

SAB No. 104 requires companies to identify separate
    units of accounting based on the consensus reached in Emerging
    Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue
     No. 00-21, 
     Revenue Arrangements With Multiple Deliverables , or
     EITF 00-21. 
     EITF 00-21 
    provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that
    involves multiple revenue-generating activities or deliverables
    should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue
    recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the
    arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate
    units of accounting. If the deliverables in a revenue
    arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to
    the EITF s separation criteria, the revenue-recognition
    policy must be determined for each identified unit. If the
    arrangement is a single unit of accounting, the
    revenue-recognition policy must be determined for the entire
    arrangement. Under arrangements where the license fees and
    research and development activities can be accounted for as a
    separate unit of accounting,

F-10

Table of Contents

Notes to

    Statements   (Continued)  

nonrefundable upfront license fees are deferred and recognized
    as revenue on a straight-line basis over the expected term of
    the Company s continued involvement in the research and
    development process. Revenues from the achievement of research
    and development milestones, if deemed substantive, are
    recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the
    milestone payments are due and collectible. Milestones are
    considered substantive if all of the following conditions are
    met: (1) the milestone is nonrefundable;
    (2) achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured
    at the inception of the arrangement; (3) substantive effort
    is involved to achieve the milestone; and, (4) the amount
    of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort
    expended, the other milestones in the arrangement and the
    related risk associated with achievement of the milestone. If
    any of these conditions are not met, the Company would recognize
    a proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as
    revenue that correlates to work already performed and the
    remaining portion of the milestone payment would be deferred and
    recognized as revenue as the Company completes its performance
    obligations.

Share-Based Compensation:   In December 2004,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,
    No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  or
    SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R, which revised
    SFAS No. 123,  Accounting For Stock-Based
    Compensation,  or, SFAS 123, and superseded Accounting
    Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25,  Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees,  or APB 25, and required
    that compensation cost relating to share-based payment
    transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the
    fair value for all awards granted after the date of adoption as
    well as for existing awards for which the requisite service had
    not been rendered as of the date of adoption.

The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1,
    2006 and selected the Black-Scholes method of valuation to
    determine the fair value of share-based payments. The Company
    applied the modified prospective application method under which
    the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to
    awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption
    date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the
    awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered
    that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining
    service period after the adoption date based on the original
    estimate of the fair value of the award. SFAS 123R required
    that compensation costs be recognized based on the estimated
    number of awards expected to vest. Changes in the estimated
    forfeiture rates are reflected prospectively.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company applied the
    intrinsic-value method of accounting for share-based
    compensation prescribed by APB 25, and related interpretations.
    As such, compensation expense for grants of stock options to
    employees or members of the Board of Directors were recorded on
    the date of grant only if the current market price of the
    Company s common stock exceeded the exercise price.
    SFAS 123 established accounting and disclosure requirements
    using a fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based
    employee compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS 123, the
    Company elected to continue to apply the intrinsic-value-based
    method of APB 25 described above, and adopted only the
    disclosure requirements of SFAS 123, as amended by
    SFAS No. 148,  Accounting For Stock-Based
    Compensation   Transition and Disclosure.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net
    income per common share applicable to common stockholders for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 as if the Company had
    applied the fair value recognition provisions for share-based
    compensation of SFAS 123, as amended:

Earnings Per Share:   Basic earnings per share
    is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
    earnings per share is computed by dividing net income adjusted
    to add back the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the
    period associated with any convertible debt issuance that is
    determined to be dilutive by the weighted-average number of
    common shares outstanding during the period increased to include
    all additional common shares that would have been outstanding as
    if the outstanding convertible debt was converted into shares of
    common stock and assuming potentially dilutive common shares,
    resulting from option exercises, had been issued and any
    proceeds thereof used to repurchase common stock at the average
    market price during the period. The proceeds used to repurchase
    common stock are assumed to be the sum of the amount to be paid
    to the Company upon exercise of options, the amount of
    compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet
    recognized and, if applicable, the amount of excess income tax
    benefit that would be credited to paid-in capital upon exercise.

Comprehensive Income:   The components of
    comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in currency
    translation adjustments, changes in the minimum pension
    liability and the after-tax effects of changes in net unrealized
    gains (losses) on marketable securities classified as available
    for sale.

    Statements   (Continued)  

A summary of accumulated other comprehensive income is
    summarized as follows:

Capitalized Software Costs:   The Company
    capitalizes software costs incurred in connection with
    developing or obtaining software. Capitalized software costs are
    included in property, plant and equipment, net and are amortized
    over their estimated useful life of three to five years from the
    date the systems are ready for their intended use.

New Accounting Principles:   In February 2006,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,  Accounting for
    Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments   an amendment of
    FASB Statements No. 133 and 140,  or SFAS 155,
    which permits a fair value re-measurement for any hybrid
    financial instrument which contains an embedded derivative that
    would otherwise require bifurcation. The Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS 155 effective January 1, 2007 and
    determined that it had no impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    or FIN 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes   an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s
    financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
     Accounting for Income Taxes,  and prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the
    provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007 and had

On May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
     FIN 48-1, 
    or FSP
     FIN 48-1, 
     Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48.  FSP
     FIN 48-1 
    provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether
    a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of
    recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The Company
    retroactively adopted the provisions of FSP
     FIN 48-1 
    effective January 1, 2007 and has determined that it had no
    impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2006, the FASB issued FSP EITF Issue
     No. 00-19-2, 
     Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements,  or
     FSP 00-19-2, 
    which addresses an issuer s accounting for registration
    payment arrangements.
     FSP 00-19-2 
    specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included
    as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement,
    should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5,  Accounting for Contingencies. 
     FSP 00-19-2 
    was issued in December 2006 and was effective immediately for
    registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments
    subject to those arrangements that were entered into or modified
    subsequent to the issuance of
     FSP 00-19-2. 
    For registration payment arrangements and financial instruments
    subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to
    the issuance of
     FSP 00-19-2, 
    it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted the
    provisions of
     FSP 00-19-2 
    effective January 1, 2007 and has determined that it had no
    impact on its consolidated financial statements. Refer to

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
     Fair Value Measurements,  or SFAS 157, which
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. The FASB partially
    deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair
    value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis while
    the effective date for nonfinancial and financial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized on a recurring basis is
    effective beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has
    determined that the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a
    material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
     The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities,  or SFAS 159, which provides companies
    with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. SFAS 159 s objective is to
    improve financial reporting by providing entities with the
    opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused
    by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without
    having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This
    Statement is expected to expand the use of fair value
    measurement, which is consistent with the Board s long-term
    measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments.
    SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure
    requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between
    companies that choose different measurement attributes for
    similar types of assets and liabilities and highlight the effect
    of a company s choice to use fair value on its earnings. It
    also requires a company to display the fair value of those
    assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value
    on the face of the balance sheet. SFAS 159 will be
    effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. The
    Company has determined that the adoption of SFAS 159 will
    not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue
     No. 07-3, 
     Accounting for Non-Refundable Advance Payments for Goods
    or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
    Activities,  or
     EITF 07-3, 
    which provides that non-refundable advance payments for future
    research and development activities should be deferred and
    capitalized until the related goods are delivered or the related
    services are performed.
     EITF 07-3 
    will be effective for the Company on a prospective basis
    beginning January 1, 2008 and evaluated on a contract by
    contract basis.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue
     No. 07-1, 
     Accounting for Collaboration Arrangements Related to the
    Development and Commercialization of Intellectual
    Property,  or
     EITF 07-1, 
    which provides guidance on how the parties to a collaborative
    agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue
    generated on sales to third parties, how sharing payments
    pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the
    income statement and certain related disclosure requirements.
     EITF 07-01 
    will be effective for the Company beginning January 2009 on a
    retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact of the adoption of
     EITF 07-1 
    will have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

Proposed
    Merger with Pharmion Corporation  

On November 18, 2007, the Company entered into a merger
    agreement to acquire Pharmion Corporation, or Pharmion, under
    which Pharmion will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the
    Company. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.
    Under the purchase method of accounting for business
    combinations, the assets and liabilities of Pharmion will be
    recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Pharmion
    common stock will be converted into the right to receive
    (i) that number of shares of Celgene common stock equal to
    the quotient, which we refer to as the exchange ratio,
    determined by dividing $47.00 by the volume weighted average
    price per share of Celgene common stock (rounded to the nearest
    cent) on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for the 15 consecutive
    trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day
    immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which we
    refer to as the measurement price; provided, however, that if
    the measurement price is less than $56.15, each share of
    Pharmion common stock will be converted into the right to
    receive 0.8370 shares of Celgene common stock and if the
    measurement price is greater than $72.93, each share of

F-14

Notes to

    Statements   (Continued)  

Pharmion common stock will be converted into the right to
    receive 0.6445 shares of Celgene common stock and
    (ii) $25.00 in cash, without interest. Each outstanding
    unvested option to purchase shares of Pharmion common stock will
    be converted into an unvested option to acquire such number of
    shares of Celgene common stock equal to the product of
    (i) the number of shares of Pharmion common stock subject
    to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the
    merger and (ii) the option exchange ratio, as defined in
    the merger agreement. Each outstanding vested option to purchase
    shares of Pharmion common stock will be canceled and will
    entitle the holder to receive only the consideration (subject to
    all applicable income and employment withholding taxes) such
    holder would have received if such holder had effected a
    cashless exercise of such vested option to purchase Pharmion
    common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the
    merger, and the shares of Pharmion common stock issued upon such
    cashless exercise were converted in the merger into the
    consideration to be received by the Pharmion stockholders
    described above. Restricted stock units held under
    Pharmion s equity compensation plans will become fully
    vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
    and, subject to applicable income and employment withholding
    taxes, will be canceled as of the effective time of the merger
    and converted into the right to receive the per share merger
    consideration to be received by holders of shares of Pharmion
    common stock as described above. Pharmion stockholders will not
    receive any fractional shares of Celgene common stock in the
    merger. Instead, any stockholder who would otherwise be entitled
    to a fractional share of Celgene common stock will be entitled
    to receive an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole
    cent), without interest, equal to the product of such fraction
    multiplied by the measurement price.

The boards of directors of Pharmion and Celgene have unanimously
    approved the merger and merger agreement. Completion of the
    merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including
    approval of the merger by the stockholders of Pharmion and
    contains customary representations, warrants and covenants made
    by Pharmion and the Company. Upon completion of the merger, the
    Celgene s stockholders are expected to own approximately
    93% of the combined company and Pharmion stockholders are
    expected to own approximately 7% of the combined company, on a
    fully diluted basis. The
     Hart-Scott-Rodino 
    Act, or HSR, thirty day waiting period has expired without the
    United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requesting
    additional information with regard to the merger. In addition,
    the Bundeskartellamt, Germany s Federal Cartel Office in
    charge of reviewing the antitrust aspects of mergers and
    acquisitions, has cleared Celgene s pending acquisition of
    Pharmion Corporation. On February 5, 2008 the
     Form S-4 
    relating to the merger of Pharmion and Celgene was declared
    effective by the SEC. The merger is expected to be completed in
    March 2008 following approval of a majority of Pharmion
    shareholders. Either party may be obligated to pay a termination
    fee of $70.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated
    under certain circumstances.

Through December 31, 2007, we have capitalized
    $7.5 million of costs relating to legal, financial and
    accounting advisory services performed in connection with the
    proposed merger with Pharmion, which are included in other
    assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

    shares are investments in enhanced cash comingled funds. Other
    asset-backed securities are securities backed by collateral
    other than mortgage obligations. Unrealized losses for
    mortgage-backed obligations, U.S. Treasury securities and
    U.S. government-sponsored agency securities were primarily
    due to increases in interest rates. Unrealized losses for
    corporate debt were due to increases in interest rates as well
    as widening credit spreads. The Company has sufficient liquidity
    and intends to hold these securities with unrealized losses
    until the market value recovers. Moreover, the Company believes
    it is probable that it will collect all amounts due according to

approximately $12.4 million at the closing,
    $3.4 million payable in each of the first five following
    years and $3.3 million in each of the subsequent five
    years. The present value of the note payable was a
    U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately,
    $26.2 million at December 31, 2007, of which
    $3.5 million, representing the amount due within one-year,
    was included in other current liabilities with the remainder
    included in other non-current liabilities. The Company imputed
    interest on the note payable using the effective yield method
    with a discount rate of 7.68%. At December 31, 2007,
    payments totaling a U.S. dollar equivalency of
    approximately $17.7 million due over years 6 to 10 are
    forgiven if, pursuant to its right, the Company elects to sell
    the facility back to Siegfried.

Convertible
    Debt  

In June 2003, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount
    of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes due June
    2008. The notes have a five-year term and a coupon rate of 1.75%
    payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. Each $1,000
    principal amount of convertible notes is convertible into
    82.5592 shares of common stock as adjusted, or a conversion
    price of $12.1125 per share, which represented a 50% premium to
    the closing price on May 28, 2003 of the Company s
    common stock of $8.075 per share, after adjusting prices for the
     two-for-one 
    stock splits affected on February 17, 2006 and
    October 22, 2004. The debt issuance costs related to these
    convertible notes, which totaled approximately
    $12.2 million, are classified under other assets on the
    consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized over five
    years. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the
    noteholders at December 31, 2007 can convert the
    outstanding notes at any time into 16,227,441 shares of
    common stock at the conversion price. In addition, the
    noteholders have the right to require the Company to redeem the
    notes in cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
    to be redeemed, plus accrued interest, prior to maturity in the
    event of a change of control and certain other transactions
    defined as a  fundamental change  in the indenture
    governing the notes. Subsequent to the September 2003 issuance
    date, $203.4 million of principal has been converted into
    16,796,239 shares of common stock.

The Company s convertible notes are classified as current
    liabilities due to their maturity in June 2008. Based on the
    price of the Company s common stock at December 31,
    2007, the Company expects the remaining noteholders to convert
    the notes into shares of common stock and does not expect such
    conversion to have a material impact on its financial condition,
    liquidity or capital resources.

At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the fair
    value of the Company s convertible notes outstanding
    exceeded the carrying value of $196.6 million and
    $399.9 million by approximately $514.4 million and
    $1,507.1 million, respectively.

Under the Registration Rights Agreement for the notes, the
    Company could be subject to liquidated damages if the
    effectiveness of the registration statement covering the
    convertible debt is not maintained at any time prior to the
    earlier of: (i) two years after the conversion of the last
    convertible note into common stock or (ii) September 2010.
    The Company believes the likelihood of occurrence of such event
    is remote and, as such, the Company has not recorded a liability
    for liquidated damages at December 31, 2007. In the
    unlikely event that it becomes probable that the Company would
    have to pay liquidated damages under the Registration Rights
    Agreement, the Company has estimated the maximum potential
    liquidated damages as of December 31, 2007 to be
    approximately $2.0 million per year.

Such damages (a) would accrue only with respect to the
    shares of the Company s common stock (underlying the notes)
    that were not already sold by the holder (under the registration
    statement or pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and that were not eligible
    for sale without a registration statement, (b) would accrue
    only for the period during which the registration statement was
    not effective, subsequent to its initial effectiveness and
    (c) would be settled in cash in accordance with the terms
    of the Registration Rights Agreement.

Intangible
    Assets and Goodwill  

Intangible Assets:   A summary of intangible
    assets by category follows:

The $1.7 million increase in gross carrying value of
    intangible assets from December 31, 2006 to
    December 31, 2007 was principally due to the impact of
    foreign currency translation.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets was approximately
    $9.5 million, $9.0 million and $2.1 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Assuming no changes in the gross carrying amount
    of intangible assets, the amortization of intangible assets for
    the next five fiscal years is estimated to be approximately
    $9.4 million per year.

Goodwill:   At December 31, 2007, the
    Company s recorded goodwill related to the acquisition of
    Penn T on October 21, 2004. The changes in the carrying
    value of goodwill are summarized as follows:

    tendered 106,517, 2,348,010 and 1,932,154 stock split-adjusted
    mature shares, respectively, related to stock option exercises.
    Such tendered shares are reflected as treasury stock. At
    December 31, 2007, treasury shares totaled 4,026,116.

A summary of changes in common stock issued and treasury stock
    is presented below after adjustments of the
     two-for-one 
    stock split in February 2006:

Rights Plan:   During 1996, the Company adopted
    a shareholder rights plan, or Rights Plan. The Rights Plan
    involves the distribution of one right as a dividend on each
    outstanding share of the Company s common stock to each
    holder of record on September 26, 1996. Each right entitles
    the holder to purchase one-tenth of a

F-22

Table of Contents   

Celgene
    Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements   (Continued)  

share of common stock. The rights trade in tandem with the
    common stock until, and are exercisable upon, certain triggering
    events, and the exercise price is based on the estimated
    long-term value of the Company s common stock. In certain
    circumstances, the Rights Plan permits the holders to purchase
    shares of the Company s common stock at a discounted rate.
    The Company s Board of Directors retains the right at all
    times prior to acquisition of 15% of the Company s voting
    common stock by an acquirer, to discontinue the Rights Plan
    through the redemption of all rights or to amend the Rights Plan
    in any respect. The Rights Plan, as amended on February 17,
    2000, increased the exercise price per right from $100.00 to
    $700.00 and extended the final expiration date of the Rights
    Plan to February 17, 2010. On August 13, 2003, the
    Rights Plan was further amended to permit a qualified
    institutional investor to beneficially own up to 17% of the
    Company s common stock outstanding without being deemed an
     acquiring person,  if such institutional investor
    meets certain requirements.

    Committee, may determine the type, amount and terms, including
    vesting, of any awards made under the Incentive Plan. Effective
    August 22, 2007, the Company amended the 1998 Incentive
    Plan to provide for continued vesting of stock options and stock
    appreciation rights, granted on or after September 1, 2007,
    during the three-year period following a participant s
     retirement  (as defined in the 1998 Incentive Plan),
    provided that the Compensation Committee under the 1998
    Incentive Plan or its designee receives not less than six months
    written notice of the participant s intent to retire. The
    1998 Incentive Plan will terminate in 2008.

With respect to options granted under the 1998 Incentive Plan,
    the exercise price may not be less than the market price of the
    common stock on the date of grant. In general, options granted
    under the 1998 Incentive Plan vest over periods ranging from
    immediate vesting to four-year vesting and expire ten years from
    the date of grant, subject to earlier expiration in case of
    termination of employment unless the participant meets the
    retirement provision under which the option would have a maximum
    of three additional years to vest. The vesting period for
    options granted under the 1998 Incentive Plan is subject to
    certain acceleration provisions if a change in control, as
    defined in the 1998 Incentive Plan, occurs. Plan participants
    may elect to exercise options at any time during the option
    term. However, any shares so purchased which have not vested as
    of the date of exercise shall be subject to forfeiture, which
    will lapse in accordance with the established vesting time
    period.

In June 1995, the stockholders of the Company approved the 1995
    Non-Employee Directors  Incentive Plan, or the 1995
    Incentive Plan, which, as amended, provides for the granting of
    non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of not more
    than 7,700,000 shares of common stock (subject to
    adjustment under certain circumstances) to directors of the
    Company who are not officers or employees of the Company, or
    Non-Employee Directors. Effective June 12, 2007, the
    Company amended the 1995 Incentive Plan to increase the number
    of options to purchase common stock granted to each new
    Non-Employee Director, from 20,000 to 25,000 and to increase the
    quarterly grants of options from 3,750 (15,000 annually) to
    4,625 (18,500 annually). The 1995 Incentive Plan also provides
    for a discretionary grant upon the date of each annual meeting
    of an additional option to purchase up to 5,000 shares to a
    Non-Employee Director who serves as a member (but not a
    chairman) of a committee of the Board of Directors and an option
    to purchase up to 10,000 shares to a Non-Employee Director
    who serves as the chairman of a committee of the Board of
    Directors. All options are granted at an exercise price that
    equals the closing market price of the Company s

common stock at the grant date and expire ten years after the
    date of grant. The 1995 Incentive Plan will terminate on
    June 30, 2015.

As a result of the acquisition of Anthrogenesis in December
    2002, we acquired the Anthrogenesis Qualified Employee Incentive
    Stock Option Plan and the Non-Qualified Recruiting and Retention
    Stock Option Plan. Neither plan has been approved by our
    stockholders. No future awards will be granted under either
    plan. Stock options issued and outstanding under both plans are
    fully vested at December 31, 2007.

Shares of common stock available for future share-based grants
    under all plans were 15,944,719 at December 31, 2007.

The following table summarizes the components of share-based
    compensation cost charged to the consolidated statements of
    operations for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:

Included in share-based compensation expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 was compensation expense related
    to non-qualified stock options of $34.0 and $57.2 million,
    respectively.

Share-based compensation cost included in inventory was
    $0.4 million at December 31, 2007. The inventory
    balance at December 31, 2006 did not include any
    share-based compensation. As of December 31, 2007, there
    was $184.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to stock options granted under the plans. That cost will
    be recognized over an expected remaining weighted-average period
    of 2.2 years.

SFAS 123R, which replaced SFAS 123, and superseded APB
    25, requires that compensation cost relating to share-based
    payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based
    on the fair value for all awards granted after the date of
    adoption as well as for existing awards for which the requisite
    service has not been rendered as of the date of adoption.

The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1,
    2006 and selected the Black-Scholes method of valuation to
    determine the fair value of share-based payments. The Company
    applied the modified prospective application method under which
    the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to
    awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption
    date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the
    awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered
    that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining
    service period after the adoption date based on the original
    estimate of the fair value of the award. The modified
    prospective transition method as prescribed by SFAS 123R
    does not require restatement of prior periods to reflect the
    impact of adopting SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires
    compensation costs to be recognized based on the estimated
    number of awards expected to vest. Changes in the estimated
    forfeiture rates are reflected prospectively.

In computing the initial APIC Pool of excess tax benefits, the
    Company applied the methodology described in paragraph 81
    of SFAS 123R. Paragraph 81 of SFAS 123R prohibits
    recognition of a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits that
    have not been realized. The Company has adopted the tax law
    method as its accounting policy regarding the ordering of tax
    benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been
    realized.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented
    all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of
    stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires excess tax
    benefits (i.e., the tax benefit recognized upon exercise of
    stock options in excess of the benefit recognized from
    recognizing compensation cost for those options) to be
    classified as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statement
    of Cash Flows. Cash received from stock option exercises for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
    $144.7 million and $113.1 million, respectively, and
    the excess tax benefit recognized was $143.0 million and
    $102.0 million, respectively. Cash received from stock
    option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
    $52.6 million. Pursuant to SFAS 123R, tax benefits
    resulting from the exercise of stock options, which have been
    presented as operating cash flows prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R are not reclassified to financing activities, but
    rather shall continue to be presented as operating cash flows.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the stock options
    granted during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005 was $24.54 per share, $17.54 per share and
    $9.60 share. The Company estimated the fair value of
    options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
    the following assumptions:

The fair value of stock options granted after January 1,
    2006 is allocated to compensation cost on a straight-line basis.
    The fair value of stock options granted before January 1,
    2006 is recognized over the attribution period using the graded
    vesting attribution approach. Compensation cost is allocated
    over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are
    generally the vesting periods.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
    zero-coupon curve. Expected volatility of stock option awards is
    estimated based on the implied volatility of the Company s
    publicly traded options with settlement dates of six months. The
    use of implied volatility was based upon the availability of
    actively traded options on the Company s common stock and
    the assessment that implied volatility is more representative of
    future stock price trends than historical volatility. Prior to
    the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company calculated expected
    volatility using only historical stock price volatility. The
    expected term of an employee share option is the period of time
    for which the option is expected to be outstanding. The Company
    has made a determination of expected term by analyzing
    employees  historical exercise experience from its history
    of grants and exercises in the Company s option database
    and management estimates. Forfeiture rates are estimated based
    on historical data.

In December 2005, the Board of Directors approved a resolution
    to grant the 2006 annual stock option awards under the 1998
    Incentive Stock Plan in 2005. All stock options awarded were
    granted fully vested. Half of the options granted had an
    exercise price of $34.05 per option, which was at a 5% premium
    to the closing price of the Company s common stock of
    $32.43 per share on the grant date of December 29, 2005;
    the remaining options granted had an exercise price of $35.67
    per option, which was at a 10% premium to the closing price of
    the Company s common stock of $32.43 per share on the grant
    date of December 29, 2005.

The Board s decision to grant these options was in
    recognition of the
    REVLIMID   
    regulatory approval and in response to a review of the
    Company s long-term incentive compensation programs. As
    these options were granted prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, they were accounted for under APB 25, and
    resulted in the Company not being required to recognize
    cumulative compensation expense of approximately
    $70.8 million for the four-year period ending
    December 31, 2009.

Stock option transactions for the year ended December 31,
    2005 under all plans are as follows:

Stock option transactions for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006 under all plans are as follows:

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $470.5 million, $540.3 million and
    $243.4 million, respectively. The Company primarily
    utilizes newly issued shares to satisfy the exercise of stock
    options. The total fair value of shares vested during the

years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $38.9 million, $36.8 million and $28.4 million
    respectively.

The following table summarizes information concerning options
    outstanding under the 1998 and 1995 Plans at December 31,
    2007:

Stock options granted to executives at the vice-president level
    and above under the 1998 Incentive Plan, after
    September 18, 2000, contained a reload feature which
    provided that if (1) the optionee exercises all or any
    portion of the stock option (a) at least six months prior
    to the expiration of the stock option, (b) while employed
    by the Company and (c) prior to the expiration date of the
    1998 Incentive Plan and (2) the optionee pays the exercise
    price for the portion of the stock option exercised or the
    minimum statutory applicable withholding taxes by using common
    stock owned by the optionee for at least six months prior to the
    date of exercise, the optionee shall be granted a new stock
    option under the 1998 Incentive Plan on the date all or any
    portion of the stock option is exercised to purchase the number
    of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of
    common stock exchanged by the optionee. The reload stock option
    is exercisable on the same terms and conditions as apply to the
    original stock option except that (x) the reload stock
    option will become exercisable in full on the day which is six
    months after the date the original stock option is exercised,
    (y) the exercise price shall be the fair value (as defined
    in the 1998 Incentive Plan) of the common stock on the date the
    reload stock option is granted and (z) the expiration of
    the reload stock option will be the date of expiration of the
    original stock option. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
    has issued 10,876,300 stock options to executives that contain
    the reload features noted above, of which 827,186 options are
    still outstanding. The 1998 Incentive Plan was amended to
    eliminate the reload feature for all stock options granted on or
    after October 1, 2004.

Warrants:   In connection with its acquisition
    of Anthrogenesis, the Company assumed the Anthrogenesis warrants
    outstanding, which were converted into warrants to purchase
    867,356 shares of the Company s common stock.
    Anthrogenesis had issued warrants to investors at exercise
    prices equivalent to the per share price of their investment. As
    of December 31, 2007, Celgene had 378,652 warrants
    outstanding to acquire an equivalent number of shares of Celgene
    common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.94 per
    warrant. Although none of the warrants were exercised in 2007,
    warrant exercises totaled 26,044, and 19,388 in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. These warrants expire on various dates from 2008
    to 2012.

Employee
    Benefit Plans  

The Company sponsors an employees  savings and retirement
    plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal
    Revenue Code, as amended, for its U.S. employees. The
    Company s contributions to the savings

F-27

Notes to

    Statements   (Continued)  

plan are discretionary and have historically been made in the
    form of the Company s common stock. Such contributions are
    based on specified percentages of employee contributions up to
    6% of base salary or a maximum permitted by law. Total expense
    for contributions to the U.S. savings plans were
    $5.4 million, $8.2 million and $6.5 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company also sponsors
    defined contribution plans in certain foreign locations.
    Participation in these plans is subject to the local laws that
    are in effect for each country and may include statutorily
    imposed minimum contributions. The Company maintains a defined
    benefit plan for certain employees in France. The obligation at
    December 31, 2007 and the net periodic pension cost for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 for this plan were immaterial.

During 2000, the Company s Board of Directors approved a
    deferred compensation plan effective September 1, 2000. In
    February 2005, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the
    Celgene Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, effective
    as of January 1, 2005, and amended the plan in February
    2008. This plan operates as the Company s ongoing deferred
    compensation plan and is intended to comply with the American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which added new Section 409A to
    the Internal Revenue Code, changing the income tax treatment,
    design and administration of certain plans that provide for the
    deferral of compensation. The Company s Board of Directors
    froze the 2000 deferred compensation plan, effective as of
    December 31, 2004, and no additional contributions or
    deferrals can be made to that plan. Accrued benefits under the
    frozen plan will continue to be governed by the terms under the
    tax laws in effect prior to the enactment of Section 409A.
    Eligible participants, which include certain top-level
    executives of the Company as specified by the plan, can elect to
    defer up to an amended 90% of the participant s base
    salary, 100% of cash bonuses and restricted stock and stock
    options gains (both subject to a minimum deferral of 50% of each
    award of restricted stock or stock option gain approved by the
    Compensation Committee for deferral). Company contributions to
    the deferred compensation plan represent a match of the
    participant s deferral up to a specified percentage
    (ranging from 10% to 25%, depending on the employee s
    position as specified in the plan) of the participant s
    base salary. The Company recorded expense of $0.6 million,
    $0.5 million and $0.4 million related to the deferred
    compensation plans in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    Company s recurring matches are fully vested, upon
    contribution. All other Company contributions to the plan do not
    vest until the specified requirements are met. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had a deferred
    compensation liability included in other non-current liabilities
    in the consolidated balance sheets of approximately
    $21.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively, which
    included the participant s elected deferral of salaries and
    bonuses, the Company s matching contribution and earnings
    on deferred amounts as of that date. The plan provides various
    alternatives for the measurement of earnings on the amounts
    participants defer under the plan. The measuring alternatives
    are based on returns of a variety of funds that offer plan
    participants the option to spread their risk across a diverse
    group of investments.

The Company has established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP,
    designed to provide key officers and executives with
    performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon
    achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives
    covering a three-year period. The Company currently has three
     3-year 
    performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31,
    2008, 2009 and 2010. The 2008 performance cycle was approved by
    the Management Compensation and Development Committee of the
    Board of Directors on February 4, 2008 and began on
    January 1, 2008 with an ending date of December 31,
    2010. Performance measures for the Plans are based on the
    following components in the last year of the
     3-year 
    cycle: 25% on earnings per share, 25% on net income and 50% on
    revenue.

Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the
    participant s salary for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Plans. The
    estimated payout for the concluded 2007 Plan is
    $6.2 million, which is included in other current
    liabilities at December 31, 2007, and the maximum potential
    payout, assuming maximum objectives are achieved for the 2008,
    2009 and 2010 Plans are $6.4 million, $8.0 million and
    $10.0 million, respectively. Such awards are payable in
    cash or, at its discretion, the Company can elect to pay the
    same value in its common stock based upon the Company s
    stock price at the payout date. The Company accrues the
    long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior
    to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an

F-28

    Statements   (Continued)  

estimate of the Company s level of achievement during the
    cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled
    to an immediate payment equal to their target award, or, if
    higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of
    the change in control. For the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized expense related to
    the LTIP of $6.9 million, $4.6 million and
    $4.4 million, respectively.

Sponsored
    Research, License and Other Agreements  

Array BioPharma Inc.:   In September 2007, the
    Company entered into a research collaboration agreement with
    Array BioPharma Inc., or Array, focused on the discovery,
    development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in
    cancer and inflammation. As part of this agreement, the Company
    made an upfront payment of $40.0 million, which was
    recorded as research and development expense, to Array in return
    for an option to receive exclusive worldwide rights for certain
    mutually selected discovery target drugs developed under the
    collaboration, except for Array s limited
    U.S. co-promotional rights. Array will be responsible for
    all discovery and clinical development through Phase I or Phase
    IIa and be entitled to receive, for each drug, potential
    milestone payments of approximately $200.0 million, if
    certain discovery, development and regulatory milestones are
    achieved and $300.0 million if certain commercial
    milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on net sales.

PTC Therapeutics, Inc.:   In September 2007, the
    Company invested $20.0 million, of which $1.1 million
    represented research and development expense, in Series 1
    Convertible Preferred Stock of PTC Therapeutics, Inc., or PTC,
    and also entered into a separate collaboration agreement whereby
    PTC would perform discovery research activities. If both parties
    subsequently agree to advance research on certain discovery
    targets, a separate research agreement would be negotiated.

Pharmion:   In November 2001, the Company
    licensed to Pharmion Corporation exclusive rights relating to
    the development and commercial use of its intellectual property
    covering thalidomide and
    S.T.E.P.S   .
    Under the terms of the agreement, the Company receives a royalty
    of 8% of Pharmion s net thalidomide sales in countries
    where Pharmion has received regulatory approval and a
    S.T.E.P.S   
    license fee of 8% in all other licensed territories. In December
    2004, following the Company s acquisition of Penn T
    Limited, the Company entered into an amended thalidomide supply
    agreement with Pharmion whereby, in exchange for a reduction in
    Pharmion s purchase price of thalidomide to 15.5% of its
    net sales of thalidomide, the Company received a one-time
    payment of 39.6 million British pounds sterling, or
    U.S. dollar equivalency of $77.0 million. Under the
    December 2004 agreement, as amended, the Company also received a
    one-time payment of $3.0 million in return for granting
    license rights to Pharmion to develop and market thalidomide in
    additional territories and eliminating certain of its license
    termination rights. Under a separate letter agreement
    simultaneously entered into by the parties, Pharmion has also
    agreed to provide the Company with an aggregate
    $8.0 million over a three-year period commencing
    January 1, 2005, and ending December 31, 2007, to
    support the two companies  existing thalidomide research
    and development efforts.

Pursuant to
     EITF 00-21, 
    the Company has determined that the Pharmion agreements
    constitute a single unit of accounting and pursuant to
    SAB No. 104, the Company has recorded the payments
    received as deferred revenue and is amortizing such payments on
    a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of
    13 years, which is the estimated life of the supply
    agreement. All payments under the thalidomide research and
    development letter agreement have been received and are
    amortized over the remaining useful life of the supply agreement.

Novartis Pharma AG:   In April 2000, the Company
    entered into an agreement with Novartis in which the Company
    granted to Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding
    Canada) to develop and market
    FOCALIN  tm  
    (d-methylphenidate, or d-MPH) and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  ,
    the long-acting drug formulation. The Company has retained the
    exclusive commercial rights to
    FOCALIN  tm  
    and FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    for oncology-related disorders, such as chronic fatigue
    associated with chemotherapy. The Company also granted Novartis

F-29

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements   (Continued)  

rights to all of its related intellectual property and patents,
    including new formulations of the currently marketed
    RITALIN   .
    Under the agreement, the Company has received upfront and
    regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling
    $55.0 million and is entitled to additional payments upon
    attainment of certain other milestone events. The Company also
    sells
    FOCALIN  tm  
    to Novartis and receives royalties on sales of all of
    Novartis  FOCALIN
    XR  tm  
    and
    RITALIN   
    family of ADHD-related products. The research portion of the
    agreement ended in June 2003.

The income tax provision is based on income (loss) before income
    taxes as follows:

The provision (benefit) for taxes on income is as follows:

Amounts are reflected in the preceding tables based on the
    location of the taxing authorities. As of December 31,
    2007, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on
    $590.0 million of unremitted earnings of our international
    subsidiaries. These earnings are expected to be reinvested
    overseas indefinitely. It is not practicable to compute the
    estimated deferred tax liability on these earnings.

The Company operates under an incentive tax holiday in
    Switzerland that expires in 2015 and exempts the Company from
    certain Swiss income taxes.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
     temporary differences.  The Company records the tax
    effect on these temporary differences as  deferred tax
    assets  (generally items that can be used as a tax
    deduction or credit in future periods) or  deferred tax
    liabilities  (generally items for which the Company
    received a tax deduction but that have not yet been recorded in
    the Consolidated Statement of Operations). The Company
    periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of
    deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these
    deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it
    believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers
    many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization
    of deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings
    experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future
    taxable income, the carryforward

periods available to it for tax reporting purposes, tax planning
    strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is
    required in making this assessment.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the tax effects of temporary
    differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and
    liabilities were as follows:

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities were classified on our balance sheet as follows:

Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our
    effective tax rate for continuing operations is as follows:

At December 31, 2007, the Company had federal net operating
    loss carryforwards of approximately $288.2 million and
    combined state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $276.6 million that will expire in the years 2008 through
    2027. The Company also has research and experimentation credit
    carryforwards of approximately $56.5 million that will
    expire in the years 2008 through 2027. Under SFAS 123R,
    excess tax benefits related to stock option deductions incurred
    after December 31, 2005, are recognized in the period in
    which the tax deduction is realized through a reduction of
    income taxes payable. As a result, the Company has not recorded
    deferred tax assets for certain stock option deductions included
    in its net operating loss carryforwards and research and
    experimentation credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2007,
    deferred tax assets have not been recorded on federal net
    operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $234.4 million, on combined state net operating loss
    carryforwards of approximately $185.1 million and for
    research and experimentation credits of approximately
    $18.1 million. These stock option tax benefits will be
    recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital when
    realized.

At March 31, 2005, the Company determined it was more
    likely than not that certain benefits of its deferred tax assets
    would be realized based on favorable clinical data related to
    REVLIMID   
    (lenalidomide) during the quarter in concert with the
    Company s nine consecutive quarters of profitability. This
    led to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the
    Company would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the
    benefits of its deferred tax assets. As a result of eliminating
    the related valuation allowances, the Company recorded an income
    tax benefit in 2005 of $42.6 million and an increase to
    additional paid-in capital of $30.2 million. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, it was more likely than not
    that the Company would realize its deferred tax assets, net of
    valuation allowances.

The Company realized stock option deduction benefits in 2007,
    2006 and 2005 for income tax purposes and has increased
    additional paid-in capital in the amount of approximately
    $159.3 million, $114.0 million and
    $103.6 million, respectively. The Company has recorded
    deferred income taxes as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income resulting in deferred income tax
    liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 of
    $43.7 million and $10.9 million, respectively.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 and FSP
     FIN 48-1 
    effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    enterprise s financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The
    Company had no cumulative effect adjustment related to the
    adoption.

The Company s tax returns have been audited by the Internal
    Revenue Service, or IRS, through the fiscal year ended
    December 31, 2003. Tax returns for the fiscal years ended
    December 31, 2004 and 2005 are currently under examination
    by the IRS. The Company is also subject to audits by various
    state and foreign taxing authorities, including but not limited
    to the major counties of Europe, the Far East, and most
    U.S. states.

The Company regularly reevaluates its tax positions and the
    associated interest and penalties, if applicable, resulting from
    audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, as well
    as changes in tax law that would reduce the technical merits of
    the position to below more likely than not. The Company believes
    that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open
    years. Many factors are considered in making these evaluations,
    including past history, recent interpretations of tax law and
    the specifics of each matter. Because tax regulations are
    subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently
    uncertain, these evaluations can involve a series of complex
    judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates
    and assumptions. The Company applies a variety of methodologies
    in making these estimates and assumptions which include studies
    performed by independent economists, advice from industry and
    subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the
    Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well
    as the Company s industry experience. These evaluations are
    based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed
    reasonable by

management. However, if management s estimates are not
    representative of actual outcomes, the Company s results of
    operations could be materially impacted.

Unrecognized tax benefits, generally represented by liabilities
    on the balance sheet, arise when the estimated benefit recorded
    in the financial statements differs from the amounts taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return because of the
    uncertainties described above. A reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to
    uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income
    taxes. Accrued interest at December 31, 2007 and 2006 is
    approximately $5.9 million and $3.0 million,
    respectively.

These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues
    common among multinational corporations. If recognized, these
    unrecognized tax benefits would have a net impact of
    approximately $188.3 million. The liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits is expected to increase in the next
    twelve months relating to operations occurring in that period.
    The Company does not expect a settlement of its
    December 31, 2007 uncertain tax benefit balance within the
    next twelve months.

In connection with the acquisition of Penn T, the Company
    entered into a five-year minimum period Technical Services
    Agreement with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, or PPSL,
    and Penn Pharmaceutical Holding Limited under which PPSL
    provides the services and facilities necessary for the
    manufacture of
    THALOMID   
    and other thalidomide formulations. At December 31, 2007,
    the remaining costs to be incurred through October 2009 was
    approximately $4.5 million.

In March 2003, the Company entered into a supply and
    distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to distribute,
    promote and sell
    ALKERAN   
    (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative
    treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under
    the terms of the agreement, the Company purchases
    ALKERAN   
    tablets and
    ALKERAN   
    for infusion from GSK and distribute the products in the United
    States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires the
    Company to purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a
    take-or-pay arrangement. The agreement has been extended through
    March 31, 2009. On December 31, 2007, the remaining
    minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled
    $38.2 million, consisting of the following subsequent
    extensions:

Contingencies:   The Company believes it
    maintains insurance coverage adequate for its current needs. The
    Company s operations are subject to environmental laws and
    regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of
    pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for
    the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous

Barr Laboratories, Inc., a generic drug manufacturer located in
    Pomona, New York, filed an ANDA for the treatment of cutaneous
    manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, in the
    manner described in our label and seeking permission from the
    FDA to market a generic version of 50mg, 100mg and 200mg
    THALOMID   .
    Under the federal Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, any generic
    manufacturer may file an ANDA with a certification (a
     Paragraph IV certification ) challenging the
    validity or infringement of a patent listed in the FDA s
    Orange Book four years after the pioneer company obtains
    approval of its New Drug Application, or an NDA. On or after
    December 5, 2006, Barr mailed notices of Paragraph IV
    certifications alleging that the following patents listed for
    THALOMID   
    in the Orange Book are invalid, unenforceable,
     and/or  not
    infringed: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,045,501 ( the  501
    patent ), 6,315,720 ( the  720 patent ),
    6,561,976 ( the  976 patent ), 6,561,977
    ( the  977 patent ), 6,755,784 ( the
     784 patent ), 6,869,399 ( the  399
    patent ), 6,908,432 ( the  432 patent ), and
    7,141,018 ( the  018 patent ). The  501,
     976, and  432 patents do not expire until
    August 28, 2018, while the remaining patents do not expire
    until October 23, 2020. On January 18, 2007, the
    Company filed an infringement action in the United States
    District Court of New Jersey against Barr. By bringing suit, the
    Company is entitled up to a maximum
     30-month 
    stay, from the date of Celgene s receipt of a
    Paragraph IV certification, against the FDA s approval
    of a generic applicant s application to market a generic
    version of
    THALOMID   .
    In June 2007, United States Patent No. 7,230,012, or
     012 patent, was issued to the Company claiming
    formulations of thalidomide and was then timely listed in the
    Orange

Book. Barr sent to the Company a supplemental Paragraph IV
    certification against the  012 patent and alleged that the
    claims of the  012 patent, directed to formulations which
    encompass
    THALOMID   ,
    were invalid. On August 23, 2007, the Company filed an
    infringement action in the United States District Court of New
    Jersey with respect to the  012 patent. On or after
    October 4, 2007, Barr filed a second supplemental notice of
    Paragraph IV certifications relating to the 150 mg
    dosage strength of
    THALOMID   
    alleging that the  501 patent,  720 patent,  976
    patent,  977 patent,  784 patent,  399 patent,
     432 patent and the  018 patent are invalid,
    unenforceable,
     and/or  not
    infringed. On November 14, 2007, the Company filed an
    infringement action in the United States District Court of New
    Jersey against Barr. All three actions have subsequent been
    consolidated. The Company intends to enforce its patent rights.
    If the ANDA is approved by the FDA, and Barr is successful in
    challenging the Company s patents listed in the Orange Book
    for
    THALOMID   ,
    Barr would be permitted to sell a generic thalidomide product.

On August 19, 2004, the Company, together with its
    exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the
    United States District Court of New Jersey against Teva
    Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., in response to notices of
    Paragraph IV certifications made by Teva in connection with
    the filing of an ANDA for
    FOCALIN   .
    The notification letters from Teva contend that United States
    Patent Nos. 5,908,850, or  850 patent, and 6,355,656, or
     656 patent, are invalid. After the suit was filed,
    Novartis listed another patent, United States Patent
    No. 6,528,530, or  530 patent, in the Orange Book in
    association with the
    FOCALIN   
    NDA. The original 2004 action asserted infringement of the
     850 patent. Teva amended its answer during discovery to
    contend that the  850 patent was not infringed by the
    filing of its ANDA, and that the  850 patent is not
    enforceable due to an allegation of inequitable conduct. Fact
    discovery in the original 2004 action expired on
    February 28, 2006. At about the time of the filing of the
     850 patent infringement action, reexamination proceedings
    for the  656 patent were initiated in the United States
    Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO. On
    September 28, 2006, the U.S. PTO issued a Notice of
    Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate, and on
    March 27, 2007, the Reexamination Certificate for the
     656 patent issued. On December 21, 2006, Celgene and
    Novartis filed an action in the United States District Court of
    New Jersey against Teva for infringement of the  656
    patent. Teva filed an amended answer and counterclaim on
    March 23, 2007. The amended counterclaim seeks a
    declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and
    unenforceability. The statutory
     30-month 
    stay of FDA approval of Teva s ANDA expired on
    January 9, 2007, and Teva proceeded to market with a
    generic version of
    FOCALIN   .
    Novartis  sales of
    FOCALIN   
    have been significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic
    FOCALIN   
    product, consequently reducing the Company s revenue from
    royalties associated with these sales. A claim has been made for
    damages resulting from Teva s sales and for a permanent
    injunction prohibiting future sales by Teva. The parties
    currently are engaged in fact discovery with respect to the
     656 patent and other issues related to Teva s product
    launch. No trial date has been set. The  530 patent is not
    part of this patent infringement action against Teva.

On September 14, 2007, the Company, together with its
    exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the
    United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
    against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. in response to a notice
    of a Paragraph IV certification made by Teva in connection
    with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN
    XR   .
    The notification letter from Teva contends that claims in United
    States Patent Nos. 5,908,850 and 6,528,530 are invalid,
    unenforceable, and not infringed by the proposed Teva products,
    and it contends that United States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and
    6,635,284 are invalid and not infringed by the proposed Teva
    products. Celgene and Novartis asserted each of these patents
    and additionally asserted United States Patent
    No. 6,355,656 in their complaint against Teva. Teva filed
    an answer and counterclaim on November 5, 2007. The
    counterclaim seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity,
    noninfringement, and unenforceability with respect to the
     patents-in-suit. 
    No trial date has been set. If the Company is unsuccessful in
    proving infringement or defending its patents, Novartis 
    sales of FOCALIN
    XR   
    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic FOCALIN
    XR   
    product, consequently reducing the Company s revenue from
    royalties associated with these sales.

    LA   
    product. Celgene and Novartis filed an amended complaint against
    Abrika on November 5, 2007 that includes infringement
    allegations directed to Abrika s proposed generic
    10 mg RITALIN
    LA   
    product. Abrika filed an answer and counterclaim to the amended
    complaint on December 5, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a
    declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and
    unenforceability with respect to the
     patents-in-suit. 
    No trial date has been set. The parties are currently engaged in
    fact discovery with a current fact discovery deadline of
    February 22, 2008. If the Company is unsuccessful in
    proving infringement or defending its patents, Novartis 
    sales of RITALIN
    LA   
    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic RITALIN
    LA   
    product, consequently reducing the Company s revenue from
    royalties associated with these sales.

On October 4, 2007, the Company, together with its
    exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the
    United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
    against KV Pharmaceutical Company in response to a notice of a
    Paragraph IV certification made by KV in connection with
    the filing of an ANDA for RITALIN
    LA   .
    The notification letter from KV contends that claims in United
    States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are not infringed by
    the proposed KV products. In their complaint against KV, Celgene
    and Novartis asserted United States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and
    6,635,284. KV filed an answer and counterclaim on
    November 26, 2007. The counterclaim seeks a declaratory
    judgment of patent invalidity, noninfringement, and
    unenforceability with respect to the
     patents-in-suit. 
    No pretrial or trial dates have been set. If the Company is
    unsuccessful in proving infringement or defending our patents,
    Novartis  sales of RITALIN
    LA   
    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic RITALIN
    LA   
    product, consequently reducing the Company s revenue from
    royalties associated with these sales.

On October 31, 2007, the Company, together with its
    exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the
    United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
    against Barr Laboratories, Inc. and Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
    in response to a notice of a Paragraph IV certification
    made by Barr in connection with the filing of an ANDA for
    RITALIN
    LA   .
    The notification letter from Barr contends that claims in United
    States Patent Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284 are invalid and not
    infringed by the proposed Barr products. In their complaint
    against Barr, Celgene and Novartis asserted United States Patent
    Nos. 5,837,284 and 6,635,284. If the Company is unsuccessful in
    proving infringement or defending our patents, Novartis 
    sales of RITALIN
    LA   
    could be significantly reduced in the United States by the
    entrance of a generic RITALIN
    LA   
    product, consequently reducing the Company s revenue from
    royalties associated with these sales.

On October 29, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Centocor,
    Inc. to prevent Centocor s use of the term
     I.M.I.D.s  in connection with Centocor s
    products, which use, we believe, is likely to cause confusion
    with our
    IMiDs   
    registered trademark for compounds (including
    REVLIMID   )
    developed or being developed by us to treat cancer and
    inflammatory diseases. In 2007, we settled the case and Centocor
    agreed to stop using the term  I.M.I.D.s.
