   PART I 
    
    ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
    
  General 
  Raytheon Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a technology and innovation leader specializing in defense and other government markets throughout the world. The terms  we ,  us ,  our ,  Raytheon  and the  Company  mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning. We develop    technologically advanced and integrated products, services and solutions in our core markets: sensing; effects; command, control, communications, computers, cyber and intelligence (C5I     ); mission support; and cybersecurity. We serve both domestic and international customers, primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers.  
    
  We were founded in 1922 and have grown internally and through a number of acquisitions. We are incorporated in the state of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 870 Winter Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451. 
    
  In May 2015, we created Raytheon|Websense, a new cybersecurity joint venture company (with Vista Equity Partners), through a series of transactions by which we acquired Websense, Inc. (Websense) from Vista Equity Partners and combined it with Raytheon Cyber Products (RCP), formerly part of our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) segment, and then sold a minority interest in the combined company to Vista Equity Partners.   Raytheon|Websense was later renamed Forcepoint   TM   .   In connection with these transactions, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure with Forcepoint as our fifth reporting segment. 
    
  In this section, we describe our business, including our business segments, product lines, customers, operations and other considerations. 
    
  Business Segments 
  We operate in five business segments: 
             
    Integrated Defense Systems; 
                
    Intelligence, Information and Services; 
                
    Missile Systems; 
                
    Space and Airborne Systems; and 
                
    Forcepoint. 
       
  The following is a description of each of our business segments. As part of the description, we include a discussion of some of the segment s notable initiatives and achievements in   2015  , such as certain key contract awards, new product introductions and acquisitions. For a discussion of the financial performance of our business segments and other financial information, see pages   48-65   of this Form 10-K.

  Sales to the U.S. Government 

(1) 
    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 
       
  Our principal U.S. government customer is the DoD; other U.S. government customers include other U.S. Intelligence Community agencies, NASA and the FAA. 
    
  U.S. Government Contracts and Regulation 
  We act as a prime contractor or major subcontractor for numerous U.S. government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs. We are also subject to certain unique business risks associated with U.S. government program funding and appropriations and government contracts, and with supplying technologically-advanced, cutting edge defense-related products and services to the U.S. government.  
  U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor's failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of and a contractor's compliance with its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. For a discussion of certain risks associated with compliance with U.S. government contract regulations and requirements, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K.  
  U.S. government contracts include both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts, subject to a contract-ceiling amount in certain cases, provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus the payment of a fee. These contracts fall into three basic types: (i) cost plus fixed fee contracts which provide for the payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii) cost plus incentive fee contracts which provide for increases or decreases in the fee, within specified limits, based upon actual cost results compared to contractual cost targets; and (iii) cost plus award fee contracts which provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the contractor against pre-established criteria. Under cost reimbursement type contracts, the contractor is  

8 

           Table of Contents  

   reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and is paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some costs incidental to performing contracts have been made partially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute, the FAR or other regulation. Examples of such costs include charitable contributions, certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs. We also classify time-and-materials (T M) contracts as cost reimbursement contracts as they are typically used to cover the contract cost plus a set amount of fee. 
  Fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, the contractor agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price and as a result, benefits from cost savings and carries the burden of cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, the contractor shares with the U.S. government savings accrued from contracts performed for less than target costs and costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost) and carries the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under such contracts, the contractor's profit may also be adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified cost objectives are met. Under FFP and FPI type contracts, the contractor usually receives either performance-based payments (PBPs) equaling up to 90% of the contract price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. government generally in amounts equaling 80% of costs incurred under U.S. government contracts. The remaining amount, including profits or incentive fees, is billed upon delivery and acceptance of end items under the contract. The DoD has expressed a preference to utilize progress payments based on costs incurred on new fixed-price contract awards as opposed to PBPs unless the contractor negotiates for PBPs. Generally speaking and subject to a number of factors, PBPs can provide improved cash flows as compared to progress payments but introduce risk to contractors in return. The DoD has also expressed a preference to utilize FPI as opposed to FFP contracts. In the event we experience a greater proportion of FPI contracts and/or progress payments for our fixed-price DoD contracts in the future than historically, it could have an adverse effect on our operating margins, cash flow and liquidity. For a discussion of certain risks associated with fixed-price and cost reimbursement contracts and risks associated with changes in U.S. government procurement rules, regulations and business practices, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
  U.S. government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. government's convenience or for default based on performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, the contractor is generally entitled to payments for its allowable costs and will receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If a contract is terminated for default, the contractor is generally entitled to payments for its work that has been accepted by the U.S. government, but a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. The U.S. government's right to terminate its contracts has not had a material adverse effect upon our operations, financial condition or liquidity. For a discussion of the risks associated with the U.S. government's right to terminate its contracts, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K.  
  U.S. government programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts and subcontracts. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. The contracts and subcontracts under a program generally are subject to termination for convenience or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or change. The U.S. government is required to equitably adjust a contract price for additions or reductions in scope or other changes ordered by it. For a discussion of the risks associated with program funding and appropriations, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  and  Overview  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K. In addition, because we are engaged in supplying technologically-advanced, cutting edge defense-related products and services to the U.S. government, we are subject to certain business risks, some of which are specific to our industry. These risks include: the cost of obtaining and retaining trained and skilled employees; the uncertainty and instability of prices for raw materials and supplies; the problems associated with advanced designs, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; and the intense competition and the constant necessity for improvement in facility utilization and personnel training. Our sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing priorities for national defense, political developments abroad and other factors. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  and  Overview  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these and other related risks.  
  We are also involved in U.S. government programs, principally through our IIS and SAS business segments, that are classified by the U.S. government and cannot be specifically described in this Form 10-K. The operating results of these classified programs are included in the applicable business segment's and our consolidated results of operations. The business risks and considerations associated with these and our international classified programs generally do not differ materially from those of our other U.S. government and international programs and products.

           Table of Contents  

   We are subject to government regulations and contract requirements that may differ from U.S. government regulation with respect to our sales to non-U.S. customers. See  International Sales  below for more information regarding our sales outside of the U.S. and Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with international sales.  
    
  International Sales   

International sales were principally in the areas of air and missile defense systems, missile systems, airborne radars, naval systems, air traffic control systems, electronic equipment, computer software and systems, personnel training, equipment maintenance and microwave communications technology, cybersecurity, and other products and services permitted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Generally, we internally fund our foreign subsidiary working capital requirements in the applicable countries. Sales and income from international operations and investments are subject to U.S. government laws, regulations and policies, including the ITAR, the EAR and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and the export laws and regulations described below. They are also subject to foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. government regulation, including import-export control, technology transfer, investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and requirements to expend a portion of program funds in-country through manufacturing agreements or other financial support obligations, known as offset obligations. In addition, embargoes, international hostilities and changes in currency and commodity values can also impact our international sales. Exchange restrictions imposed by various countries could restrict the transfer of funds between countries, us and our subsidiaries. We have acted to protect ourselves against various risks through insurance, foreign exchange contracts, contract provisions, government guarantees and/or progress payments. Our international sales in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately   $1.3 billion  ,   $1.1 billion   and   $1.2 billion   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, the majority of which were in British pounds and Australian dollars with the remainder primarily in euros and Canadian dollars. See total net sales and property, plant and equipment by geographical area set forth in  Note 16: Business Segment Reporting  within Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 
    
  In connection with certain foreign sales, we utilize the services of sales representatives who are paid commissions in return for services rendered, and international consultants who are paid a fixed retainer fee. Our Forcepoint joint venture also sells certain products and services, both domestically and internationally, primarily through a network of distributors and value-added resellers. 
    
  Depending on the type of international sale, Raytheon must either seek various approvals from the U.S. government under the foreign military sales process or may require an export authorization and the issuance of a license by either the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (formerly the Foreign Military Sales Act) and its implementing regulations under the ITAR, the U.S. Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act and its implementing regulations under the EAR as kept in force by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), and/or the U.S. Department of the Treasury under IEEPA or the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Such licenses may be denied for reasons of U.S. national security or foreign policy. In the case of certain exports of defense equipment and services, the Department of State must notify Congress at least 15 30 days (depending on the identity of the importing country that will utilize the equipment and services) prior to authorizing such exports. During that time, Congress may take action to block or delay a proposed export by joint resolution which is subject to Presidential veto. Additional information regarding the risks associated with our international business is contained in Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Classified Sales 
  Classified sales include U.S. government sales on programs designated as classified by the U.S. government, as well as international sales on programs for which the customer, end user or end product is prohibited from being publicly disclosed. Total classified sales were   16%   in   2015   and   15%   in   2014   and   2013  .

  Approximately   $17.2 billion   of the   December 31, 2015   year-end backlog is not expected to be filled during the following twelve months. These amounts include both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated or obligated to us). For additional information related to backlog figures, see  Segment Results  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Research and Development 
  We conduct extensive research and development activities to continually enhance our existing products and services and develop new products and services to meet our customers  changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. During   2015   we expended   $706 million   on research and development efforts compared to   $500 million   and   $465 million   in   2014   and   2013  , respectively. These expenditures principally have been for product development for the U.S. government. We also conduct funded research and development activities under U.S. government contracts which are included in total net sales. For additional information related to our research and development activities, see  Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Raw Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality 
  We are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. Some products require relatively scarce raw materials. We generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products.  
    
  In addition, we must comply with specific procurement requirements which may, in effect, limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. In some instances, for a variety of reasons, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers. We enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and take other actions to ensure the availability of needed materials, components and subsystems. We are also dependent on suppliers to provide genuine original equipment manufacturer parts and have a robust set of standardized policies to detect counterfeit material, especially electronic components, throughout our supply chain.  
    
  In recent years, our revenues in the second half of the year have generally exceeded revenues in the first half. Some of the factors that can affect revenue recognition between accounting periods include the timing of new program awards (including international contract awards and approvals), the availability of U.S. government funding, product deliveries (which are dependent on availability of materials) and customer acceptance. We expect this trend to continue in 2016. 
    
  Competition 
  We directly participate in most major areas of development in the defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support markets. Technical superiority, reputation, price, past performance, delivery schedules, financing and reliability are among the principal competitive factors considered by customers in these markets. We also compete in the commercial cybersecurity market, which is characterized by rapid changes in technology, products, customer specifications and industry standards. We compete worldwide with a number of U.S. and international companies  

11 

           Table of Contents  

   in these markets, some of which may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. We frequently partner on various programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. In addition, U.S. defense spending levels in the future are increasingly difficult to predict. Changes in U.S. defense spending may potentially limit certain future market opportunities. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  and  Overview  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these and other related risks. 
    
  Intellectual Property 
  We own an intellectual property portfolio that includes many U.S. and foreign patents, as well as unpatented trade secrets and know-how, data, software, trademarks and copyrights, all of which contribute to the preservation of our competitive position in the market. In certain instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. We also license our intellectual property to others, including our customers, in certain instances. The U.S. government has licenses in certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and has the right to use and authorize others to use such intellectual property, including the inventions covered by such patents for U.S. government purposes. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our operations, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material effect on our business. 
    
  Employment 
  As of December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   61,000   employees. Approximately   7%   of our employees are unionized. We consider our union-management relationships to be generally satisfactory. 
    
  Environmental Regulation 
  Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of international, federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations. We have provided for the estimated cost to complete remediation or, in the case of multi-party sites, our reasonably expected share thereof where we have determined that it is probable that we will incur such costs in the future in connection with (i) facilities that are now, or were previously, owned or operated by us, (ii) sites where we have been named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similarly designated by other environmental agencies, or (iii) sites where we have been named in a cost recovery or contribution claim by a non-governmental third party. It is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate amount of environmental cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the discovery and application of innovative remediation technologies, and the status and interpretation of laws and regulations.  
    
  If we are ultimately found to have liability at a multi-party site where we have been designated a PRP or have been named in a cost recovery or contribution claim from a non-governmental third party, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other PRPs. Generally in the U.S. and certain other countries, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean-up and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing U.S. environmental laws, responsible parties are usually jointly and severally liable and, therefore, potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we are required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the unlikely event that we would be required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, nor do they reflect the possibility that we may recover some of these additional environmental costs from insurance policies or from other PRPs. However, a portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government.  
    
  We manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government and we relied (and continue to rely with respect to past practices) upon U.S. government funding to pay such costs. While the government remains responsible for capital and operating costs associated with environmental compliance, responsibility for fines and penalties associated with environmental noncompliance is typically borne by either the U.S. government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Fines and penalties are unallowable costs under the contracts pursuant to which such facilities are managed.  
    
  Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were to be convicted of a criminal violation of certain U.S. federal environmental statutes, including the Federal Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, the

   facility or facilities involved in the violation would be placed by the EPA on the  Excluded Parties List  maintained by the Government Services Administration. The listing would continue until the EPA concluded that the cause of the violation had been cured. Listed facilities cannot be used in performing any U.S. government contract awarded during any period of listing by the EPA.

   We depend on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in government defense spending and priorities could have consequences on our financial position, results of operations and business. 
    
  In   2015  , U.S. government sales, excluding foreign military sales, accounted for approximately   68%   of our total net sales. Our revenues from the U.S. government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), as well as a broad range of programs with the U.S. Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. The funding of our programs is subject to the overall U.S. government policies, budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling. 
    
  In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. In 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which established specific limits on annual appropriations for fiscal years (FY) 2012 2021. Pursuant to the BCA, which was amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), the FY 2013 DoD budget was reduced by 7.8% as compared to FY 2012, and the DoD budget remained essentially flat for FY 2014 and 2015. While the BBA provides for stability and modest growth to the DoD budget through FY 2017, future spending levels are uncertain. In addition, in recent years the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both a governmental shut-down and Continuing Resolutions to extend sufficient funds only for U.S. government agencies to continue operating. Additionally, while the BBA eliminates the debt ceiling through FY 2017, the national debt has recently threatened to reach the statutory debt ceiling, and such an event in future years could result in the U.S. government defaulting on its debts.  
    
  As a result, defense spending levels are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future governmental priorities and the state of governmental finances. Significant changes in defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
    
  Our financial results largely are dependent on our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding and timing, as well as termination. Our financial results could also be affected by development delays, cost overruns or product failures in connection with these contracts. 
    
  Our financial results largely are dependent on our performance under our U.S. government contracts. While we are involved in numerous programs and are party to thousands of U.S. government contracts, the termination of one or more of such contracts, or the occurrence of delays, cost overruns and product failures in connection with one or more large contracts, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Furthermore, we can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of termination of any of our contracts.  
    
  U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. government's convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor.  
    
  The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations, which are made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. In addition, regular appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in revenue collection delays or delays in our contract performance due to lack of funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements. Furthermore, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, or are reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate our contract or subcontract under such program.

           Table of Contents  

   Our U.S. government contracts also typically involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In some instances, product requirements or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns and product failures, in connection with performing our U.S. government contracts. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investment amounts may not be recouped if we are not chosen for new contract awards. 
    
  Our U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursable contracts. Fixed-price contracts represent approximately   65%   of our backlog, and are either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we carry the burden of cost overruns in excess of a negotiated cost ceiling, and share with the U.S. government any costs incurred in excess of a negotiated cost target up to the cost ceiling amount. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but generally are not reimbursed for costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations or unauthorized costs above any cost ceiling amount. Due to the nature of our work under many of our U.S. government contracts discussed above, we may experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. Some of our U.S. government contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, we may not realize their full benefits. Our contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations, which are discussed in more detail below.  
    
  In addition, we are involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. government, principally through our IIS and SAS business segments, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes and claims. 
    
  Our future success depends on our ability to develop new offerings and technologies for our current and future markets. 
    
  To achieve our business strategies and continue to grow our revenues and operating profit, we must successfully develop new offerings and technologies or adapt or modify our existing offerings and technologies for our current core defense markets and our future markets, including new international, civil, commercial, growth and emerging markets. Accordingly, our future performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: 
    
           - 
    Identify the needs of, and growth opportunities in, new and emerging markets; 
              - 
    Identify emerging technological and other trends in our current and future markets; 
              - 
    Identify additional uses for our existing technology to address customer needs in our current and future markets;  
              - 
    Develop and maintain competitive products and services for our current and future markets;  
              - 
    Enhance our offerings by adding innovative features that differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors; 
              - 
    Develop, manufacture and bring solutions to market quickly at cost-effective prices; 
              - 
    Enhance product designs for export and releasability to international markets; and 
              - 
    Effectively structure our businesses, through the use of joint ventures, collaborative agreements and other forms of alliances, to reflect the competitive environment. 
       
  We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to invest significant financial resources to develop new offerings and technologies or to adapt or modify our existing offerings and technologies, including through customer funded and internal research and development, acquisitions and joint ventures or other teaming arrangements. We believe this is true to meet demands and expand within both our domestic and international markets. These expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies or identification of and expansion into new markets. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or deflect resources from other projects. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market for our offerings will develop or continue to expand or that we will be successful in newly identified markets as we currently anticipate or that the acquisitions, joint ventures or other teaming arrangements we may enter into in pursuit of developing new offerings and technologies will be successful. The failure of our technology  

15 

           Table of Contents  

   to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products. 
    
  Additionally, the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our new product development efforts or our products or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  Competition within our markets may reduce our revenues and market share and limit our future market opportunities. 
    
  We operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. We anticipate increased competition in our core markets as a result of continued defense industry consolidation, including cross-border consolidation of competition, which has enabled companies to enhance their competitive position against us. We are also facing heightened competition in our domestic and international markets from foreign and multinational firms. In addition, as discussed in more detail above, increased pressure to limit U.S. defense spending and changes in the U.S. government procurement environment may limit certain future market opportunities for us. For example, the DoD increasingly is committed to awarding contracts through competitive bidding and relying on competitive contract award types. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other support work. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core markets, we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, due to the current competitive environment, we continue to see an increase in bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned, requiring a re-bid of the contract. 
    
  In addition, we formed Forcepoint in May 2015, our cybersecurity joint venture discussed in more detail below, to accelerate our growth in the commercial cybersecurity market. However, there can be no assurance that Forcepoint will meet our expectations. Additionally, the commercial cybersecurity market is characterized by rapid changes in technology, products, customer specifications and industry standards, and Forcepoint may not be able to successfully and timely develop new products and services or adapt its current offerings to such changes in order to compete effectively. In addition, Forcepoint's revenues are dependent on third-party sales channels as well as its internal sales force, and there can be no assurance that these sales efforts will be successful. If Forcepoint is unable to compete successfully in the commercial cybersecurity market, it may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our other operations. 
    
  As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to extensive procurement rules and regulations. Changes in such rules, regulations and business practice could negatively affect current programs and potential awards, and our business could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with any procurement rules and regulations. 
    
  U.S. government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements including export-import control, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. These requirements impact our performance and compliance costs. In addition, the U.S. government has and may continue to implement initiatives focused on efficiencies, affordability and cost growth and other changes to its procurement practices which may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and could affect whether and, if so, how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so.  
    
  For example, in April 2015 the DoD initiated Better Buying Power 3.0 (BBP), which reiterates the DoD s previously-announced preferences with respect to contractual payment and cost reimbursement terms, and contractor independent research and development efforts. BBP maintains a preference for incentive-based contracts that set cost and profit targets and require contractors to share cost overruns and underruns with the U.S. government. BBP also indicates a preference for progress payments, which are usually lower than performance-based payments and would thus affect the timing of our cash flows. 
    
  In addition, failure to comply with the procurement regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and the assessment of civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause,  

16 

           Table of Contents  

   from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption. The penalties or sanctions resulting from any failure to comply with applicable requirements, including contract termination, could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other U.S. government contracts in the future. 
    
  Issues with component availability, subcontractor performance or key supplier performance may affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products and services.  
    
  We are dependent upon the delivery by suppliers of materials and the assembly by subcontractors of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely and satisfactory manner and in full compliance with applicable terms and conditions. Some products require relatively scarce raw materials. We also are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials we use and may, in effect, limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. These procurement requirements include restrictions on the use of certain chemicals in the European Union and requirements for genuine original equipment manufacturer parts. As we continue to seek further cost efficiencies throughout the enterprise, we may centralize procurements in order to attain better pricing through strategic sourcing, which may increase our dependency on certain suppliers. In some instances, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers. If certain component materials are not available or if any of these suppliers or subcontractors otherwise fails to meet our needs or becomes insolvent, we may not have readily available alternatives or alternatives at prices that meet the demands of our customers. While we enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and take other actions, such as accelerating supplier payments commensurate with value delivered, to ensure financial viability and the availability of needed materials, components and subsystems, we cannot be sure that such items will be available in the quantities we require, if at all. In addition, some of our suppliers or subcontractors, especially smaller entities, may be susceptible to changes in global economic conditions that could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. If we experience a material supplier or subcontractor problem, our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our customer obligations could be negatively impacted, which could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts and damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers. We could also incur additional costs in addressing such a problem. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, we must conduct diligence and provide disclosure regarding the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, which may impact our procurement practices and increase our costs. 
    
  Our international business is subject to geopolitical and economic factors, regulatory requirements and other risks. 
    
  Our international business exposes us to geopolitical and economic factors, regulatory requirements, increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. These risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic business. In   2015  , our sales to customers outside the U.S. (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government) accounted for   31%   of our total net sales. Our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate.  
    
  Our international business is sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in worldwide economic conditions, and various regional and local economic and political factors, including volatility in energy prices, changes in U.S. foreign policy, and other risks and uncertainties. Our international sales are subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other anti-corruption and export laws and regulations. We maintain policies and controls to comply with such laws and regulations and exercise oversight of such compliance. However, any failure by us or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and resolutions could result in criminal, civil or administrative penalties, including fines, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our ability to export our products. In addition, due to the nature of our products, we must first obtain licenses and authorizations from various U.S. government agencies before we are permitted to sell our products outside of the U.S. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that certain sales will not be prevented or delayed. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  

17 

           Table of Contents  

   Our international sales are also subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices which may differ from U.S. government regulations. These include regulations relating to export-import control, technology transfer, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Furthermore, our international sales contracts may be subject to non-U.S. contract laws and regulations and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or terms that may be interpreted differently by foreign courts. These contracts may also be subject to termination at the customer's convenience or for default based on performance, and may be subject to funding risks. In addition, the timing of orders, customer negotiations, governmental approvals and notifications from our international customers can be less predictable than from our domestic customers, and this may lead to variations in international bookings and sales each year. We must also manage a certain degree of exposure to the risk of currency fluctuations. 
    
  Our international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may receive loans, marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies. 
    
  Our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. Approvals of offset thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay contract awards, and may, in certain countries, require the creation of a joint venture with a local company, which may control the venture. This could result in liability for violations of law for actions taken by these entities, such as laws related to anti-corruption, import and export, or local laws which may differ from U.S. laws and requirements. Such offset obligations are generally multi-year arrangements and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. We also are exposed to risks associated with using third-party foreign representatives and consultants for international sales, and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers in connection with international programs. As a result of these factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, and could incur losses on such programs which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
    
  Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber attacks and other security breaches and other disruptions.  
    
  As part of our business, we face certain security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary, sensitive or classified information, threats to physical security, including our facilities and personnel, and threats from terrorism or similar acts. We also face the potential for business disruptions associated with natural disasters. Cybersecurity threats in particular are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We have in the past and will in the future continue to be the subject of cybersecurity threats. In addition, our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business generally face similar security threats, and in some cases we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these parties to protect against security threats. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures and controls and have invested in significant resources to appropriately identify and monitor these threats and mitigate potential risks, including risks involving our customers and suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches, disruptions to mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data, or harm to facilities or personnel. 
    
  In addition, as a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers, including through Forcepoint, our products and services may be the targets of cyber attacks that attempt to sabotage or otherwise disable them, or our cybersecurity and other products and services ultimately may not be able to effectively detect, prevent, or protect against or otherwise mitigate losses from all cyber attacks. 
    
  The impact of these security threats and other disruptions, including cyber attacks and other security breaches, is difficult to predict. Furthermore, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs. These threats and other events could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties, could require significant management attention and resources, could result in the loss of business, regulatory actions and potential liability, and could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, any one of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

   We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.  
    
  Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. In addition, certain personnel may be required to receive security clearance and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. Furthermore, a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing retirement. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business. 
    
  Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit or investigatory finding by the U.S. government. 
    
  As a government contractor, we are subject to audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the DoD and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government. The DoJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. 
    
  We use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.  
    
  Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, including risks associated with customer-directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters, management's judgments associated with estimating contract revenues and costs, and assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, we must make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete a contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials; consider whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented; consider incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating sales and profit rates, and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance; and use estimates of award fees in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of management's judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  For a detailed discussion of how our financial statements can be affected by contract accounting policies, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Significant changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates and assumed long-term return on plan assets (ROA), as well as our actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our earnings, equity and pension contributions in future periods.  
    
  We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit (PRB) plans' expense or income which involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to our discount rate, long-term ROA and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and PRB plans' expense and funded status, and our cash contributions to such plans, could negatively change which would

           Table of Contents  

   negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, differences between our actual investment returns and our long-term ROA assumption would result in a change to our pension and PRB plans' expense and funded status and our required contributions to the plans. They may also be impacted by changes in regulatory, accounting and other requirements applicable to pensions. 
    
  For a detailed discussion of how our financial statements can be affected by pension and PRB plan accounting policies, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  
    
  If we fail to manage our acquisitions, investments, divestitures, joint ventures and other transactions successfully, these activities could adversely affect our future financial results.  
    
  In pursuing our business strategies, we continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments, acquisitions, divestitures, and joint venture, teaming and other collaborative arrangements. We undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base, as well as expand our offerings and market reach into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities. In evaluating such transactions, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Furthermore, these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties, including the risks involved with entering new markets, the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements, challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, unidentified issues not discovered in Raytheon s due diligence, the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives, the potential impairment of acquired assets, the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies, and the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses. 
    
  In May 2015, we created Raytheon|Websense, a new cybersecurity joint venture company (with Vista Equity Partners), through a series of transactions by which we acquired Websense, Inc. (Websense) from Vista Equity Partners and combined it with Raytheon Cyber Products (RCP), formerly part of our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) segment, and then sold a minority interest in the combined company to Vista Equity Partners.   Raytheon|Websense was later renamed Forcepoint. Forcepoint offers products and services worldwide to enterprise customers, small- and medium-sized businesses, public sector entities and internet service providers primarily through a network of distributors and value-added resellers. Raytheon owns 80.3% of the joint venture and Vista Equity Partners owns 19.7%. The joint venture agreement provides Vista Equity Partners with certain rights to exit the joint venture, including the right to require Raytheon to purchase all of Vista Equity Partners  interest in Forcepoint and the right to require Forcepoint to pursue an initial public offering, as well as certain other rights with respect to the management of Forcepoint's business.     Therefore, in addition to the other risks described above, the exercise of any such rights by Vista Equity Partners could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, or the management of our business as a whole. For a more detailed discussion regarding Forcepoint, see  Forcepoint  beginning on page 6 within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 
     
  Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets, and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015  , we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately   $15.7 billion  , net of accumulated amortization, which represented approximately   54%   of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business which will require us to record goodwill and intangible assets based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. Future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  
    
  For a detailed discussion of how our financial statements can be affected by goodwill accounting policies, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

   The outcome of litigation in which we have been named, or may in the future be named, as a defendant is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  We are the defendant in a number of litigation matters and are subject to various other claims, demands and investigations. In addition, we may be subject to future litigation matters, claims, demands and investigations. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims, demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Some of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.  
    
  Approximately   4,000   of our employees are unionized, which represents approximately   7%   of our employee base at   December 31, 2015  . As a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.  
    
  We own many U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, and have rights in unpatented know-how, data, software, trademarks and copyrights. The U.S. government has licenses under certain of our patents and certain other intellectual property that are developed or used in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others (including our competitors) to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes. The U.S. government may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in U.S. government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights. There can be no assurance that any of our patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or circumvented by third parties. In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. In the future, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or third-party development of similar technologies. Moreover, the laws concerning intellectual property vary among nations and the protection provided to our intellectual property by the laws and courts of foreign nations may not be as advantageous to us as the remedies available under U.S. law. 
    
  Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.  
    
  We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and, in some cases, have in the past been named as a defendant in related  toxic tort  claims.  
    
  We are also subject to laws and regulations that: (i) impose requirements for the proper management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (ii) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (iii) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases and/or reduce the risks of injury to people in our workplaces.  
    
  If we were to be convicted of a criminal violation of certain U.S. federal environmental statutes, including the Federal Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be placed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the  Excluded Parties List  maintained by the Government Services Administration. The listing  

21 

           Table of Contents  

   would continue until the EPA concluded that the cause of the violation had been cured. Listed facilities cannot be used in performing any U.S. government contract awarded during any period of listing by the EPA. 
    
  We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance.  
    
  A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services, including but not limited to missile systems, command and control systems, border security systems, air traffic management systems, and cybersecurity products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses from the qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, or otherwise. The amount of the insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  
    
  Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.  
    
  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability.

    ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
    
  We and our subsidiaries operate in a number of plants, laboratories, warehouses and office facilities in the U.S. and abroad. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015   we owned, leased and/or utilized (through operating agreements) approximately   27.5 million   square feet of floor space for manufacturing, engineering, research, administration, sales and warehousing, approximately   93%   of which was located in the U.S. Of such total, approximately   45%   was owned (or held under a long-term ground lease with ownership of the improvements), approximately   49%   was leased, and approximately   6%   was Government owned. In addition to the   27.5 million   square feet of floor space described above, approximately   142,241   square feet of space was leased or subleased by us to unrelated third parties. 
    
  There are no major encumbrances on any of our facilities other than financing arrangements, which in the aggregate are not material. In the opinion of management, our properties have been well maintained and are suitable and adequate for us to operate at present levels, and the productive capacity and extent of utilization of the facilities are appropriate for our existing real estate requirements.

    ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We primarily engage in providing products and services under contracts with the U.S. government and, to a lesser degree, under direct foreign sales contracts, some of which the U.S. government funds. As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to many levels of audit and investigation by the U.S. government relating to our contract performance and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA); the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA); the Inspectors General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other departments and agencies; the Government Accountability Office; the Department of Justice (DoJ); and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DoJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. 

23 

           Table of Contents  

   In addition, various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against us. We do not expect these proceedings to result in any additional liability that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

OVERVIEW 
    
  Introduction 
  Raytheon Company develops    technologically advanced and integrated products, services and solutions in our core markets: sensing; effects; command, control, communications, computers, cyber and intelligence (C5I     ); mission support; and cybersecurity. We serve both domestic and international customers, primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers.     
    
  In May 2015, we created Raytheon|Websense, a new cybersecurity joint venture company (with Vista Equity Partners), through a series of transactions by which we acquired Websense, Inc. (Websense) from Vista Equity Partners and combined it with Raytheon Cyber Products (RCP), formerly part of our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) segment, and then sold a minority interest in the combined company to Vista Equity Partners.   Raytheon|Websense was later renamed Forcepoint.   In connection with these transactions, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure with Forcepoint as our fifth reporting segment.   We now operate in five business segments: Integrated Defense Systems (IDS); Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS); Missile Systems (MS); Space and Airborne Systems (SAS); and Forcepoint. For a more detailed description of our segments, see  Business Segments  within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 
    
  The amounts, discussion and presentation of our business segments, including Corporate and eliminations for intersegment activity, set forth in this Form 10-K, reflect the Forcepoint transaction. The Forcepoint results reflect RCP results for all periods and Websense results after the acquisition date of May 29, 2015.   None of the changes impact our previously reported consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows. 
    
  In addition, effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized certain product areas of our IDS and IIS businesses to more efficiently leverage our capabilities, but because this change occurred after December 31, 2015, the amounts, discussion and presentation of our financial results for purposes of this Form 10-K do not reflect this change. Rather, our structure as of December 31, 2015 is reflected.    
    
  In this section, we discuss our business environment and how certain factors may affect our business, key elements of our strategy, and how our financial performance is assessed and measured by management. 
    
    Business Environment 
    
  Domestic Considerations 
  U.S. government sales, excluding foreign military sales, accounted for   68%   of our total net sales in 2015. Our principal U.S. government customer is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

           Table of Contents  

   On November 2, 2015, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA) into law. The BBA sets fiscal year (FY) 2016 and 2017 DoD spending caps that exceed recent DoD budget funding levels. These spending caps are recognized by both the Administration and Congress and are therefore expected to lead to a stable budget process for those two years. In addition, while the spending cap increase does not meet the DoD's original FY 2016 base budget funding request or its planned FY 2017 funding level, it should provide for modest growth in the DoD's modernization budgets for FY 2016 and FY 2017. Modernization funding, which consists of procurement and research and development, is of particular importance to defense contractors. Despite the expected stability in FY 2016 and 2017, defense budget funding levels, which are subject to budget and appropriation decisions and processes, are difficult to predict beyond the near-term. 
    
  In addition to the DoD budget considerations discussed above, future domestic defense spending levels are impacted by a number of additional factors, including external threats to our national security, funding for on-going operations overseas, the priorities of the Administration and the Congress, overall health of the U.S. and world economies, and the state of governmental finances. However, we also continue to expect the DoD to continue to prioritize and protect the key capabilities required to execute its strategy, including Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), cybersecurity, missile defense, electronic warfare, undersea warfare, unmanned systems, special operations forces and interoperability with allied forces. We believe those priorities are well aligned with our product offerings, technologies, services and capabilities. 
    
  We currently are involved in over   15,000   contracts, with no single contract accounting for more than   5%   of our total net sales in   2015  . Although we believe our diverse portfolio of programs and capabilities is well suited to a changing defense environment, we face numerous challenges and risks, as discussed above. For more information on the risks and uncertainties that could impact the U.S. government's demand for our products and services, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
    
  International Considerations 
  In   2015  , our sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for   31%   of our total net sales (including foreign military sales through the U.S. government). Internationally, the growing threat of additional terrorist activity, cyber threats, emerging nuclear states, long-range missiles and conventional military threats have led to an increase in demand for defense systems and services and other security solutions. In North Asia, both short- and long-term regional security concerns are increasing demand for air and missile defense, air/naval modernization, and maritime security. In the Middle East and North Africa, threats from state and non-state actors are increasing demand for air and missile defense, air/land/naval force modernization, precision engagement, ISR, maritime and border security, and cybersecurity solutions. Given such threat environments, we expect our customers to continue to prioritize security investments even if their budgets are impacted by volatile short-term energy prices. In Europe, while economic challenges continue to restrain and even reduce the defense budgets of certain European nations, others have made commitments to increase spending in response to recent geopolitical events and conflicts in Eastern Europe and the resulting uncertainty and security threat environment. Based on the foregoing, we expect that European nations will continue to seek advanced air and missile defense capabilities. Overall, we believe many international defense budgets have the potential to grow and to do so at a faster rate than the U.S. defense budget. However, international demand is sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers and geopolitical uncertainties, which may be driven by changes in threat environments, volatility in worldwide economic conditions, regional and local economic and political factors, U.S. foreign policy and other risks and uncertainties. For more information on the risks and uncertainties that could impact international demand for our products and services, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Our Strategy 
  The following are the broad elements of our strategy: 
             
    Build upon our areas of strength within our key mission areas; 
                
    Focus additional resources on emerging opportunities within the DoD market; 
                
    Engage key countries as individual markets with multiple customers; and 
                
    Extend Raytheon's advanced cyber solutions beyond the U.S. government into international and commercial markets. 
       
  We believe that our broad mix of technologies, domain expertise and key capabilities, our cost-effective, best-value solutions and the alignment of these strengths with customer needs position us favorably to grow in our key mission areas of missile defense; electronic warfare; command, control, communications, computers, cyber, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C5ISR); precision weapons; cybersecurity; and training. Domestically, customers are increasingly seeking cost-effective mission solutions. These solutions can take the form of new electronics or electronic upgrades, but draw on our market focus area capabilities, deep domain expertise and system architecture skills. We continue to explore opportunities to make these affordable solutions more readily available to our international customers, including through enhanced design for  

30 

           Table of Contents  

   export and releasability. We also continue to make investments to support our strategy, including through acquisitions and research and development. 
    
  International Growth   Because of the breadth of our offerings, our systems integration capability, the value of our solutions and our strong legacy in the international marketplace, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our international business. As discussed under  International Considerations,  we believe demand continues to grow for solutions in air and missile defense, precision engagement, naval systems integration, ISR, and cybersecurity. As a result we continue to enhance our focus on global growth through increased investment in our international business in existing and new international markets. Such investment provides additional resources and capabilities, both in-country and in the U.S., that strengthen the company s position to pursue both existing and new opportunities. Although we believe our international business is well positioned to continue to grow, we recognize that we face substantial competition from both U.S. companies and other competitors in international markets, as well as the challenges of changing budget priorities, overall spending pressures and the timing of contract awards.

    Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 
       
  Cybersecurity   We continue to both enhance our capabilities in the cyber market and leverage the capabilities of the 16 cyber acquisitions made since 2007. In 2015, we successfully executed on our strategy to extend our significant cyber capabilities into the commercial markets by creating Forcepoint, a new commercial cybersecurity joint venture company (with Vista Equity Partners) that combines Websense and RCP, formerly part of our IIS business. Forcepoint is leveraging its unique combination of capabilities to deliver  defense-grade  cybersecurity solutions to commercial markets worldwide. For more information on the Forcepoint joint venture transaction, see Item 1 "Business," and  Note 5: Forcepoint Joint Venture  within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  
    
  We also provide cyber capabilities to government customers, including the Intelligence Community, the DoD, other defense and civil global customers, as well as embed information assurance capabilities in our products and our information technology infrastructure. We believe the commercial and government cyber markets both represent strong growth markets for Raytheon. We expect to continue to seek opportunities to leverage our extensive cyber capabilities and to grow and scale our cyber businesses. 
    
  Focus on the Customer and Execution 
  Our customer focus continues to be a critical part of our strategy underpinned by a focus on performance, relationships and solutions. Performance means being able to meet customer commitments, which is ensured through strong processes, metrics and oversight. We maintain a  process architecture  that spans our defense businesses and our broad programs and pursuits. It consists of enterprisewide processes and systems such as our Integrated Product Development System (IPDS), which assures consistency of evaluation and execution at each step in a program's life-cycle; Product Data Management (PDM), which is our business system software for engineering; Achieving Process Excellence (APEX), which is our SAP business system software for accounting, finance and program management; Process Re-Invention Integrating Systems for Manufacturing (PRISM), which is our SAP software for manufacturing operations; Advanced Company Estimating System (ACES), which is our cost proposal system; and Raytheon Enterprise Supplier Assessment (RESA) tool for Supply Chain Management. These processes and systems are linked to an array of front-end and back-end metrics. With this structure, we are able to track results and be alerted to potential issues through numerous oversight mechanisms, including operating reviews and annual operating plan reviews.  
    
  We are also continuing to build strong customer relationships by working with them as partners and including them on Raytheon Six Sigma   TM    teams to jointly improve their programs and processes. We are increasingly focused on responding to our customers' changing requirements with rapid and effective solutions to real-world problems. In recognition of our customers' constraints and priorities, we also continue to drive various cost reductions across the Company by continuing to focus on enterprise collaboration and improving productivity and strong execution throughout our programs. We have worked to reduce costs across the Company and improve efficiencies in our production facilities, and we continue to increase value through Raytheon Six Sigma   TM   , the implementation of lean processes, reduced cycle times and strategic supply chain initiatives, in addition to other initiatives.

   FINANCIAL SUMMARY 
  We use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations: 
             
    Bookings   a forward-looking metric that measures the value of firm orders awarded to us during the year; 
                
    Net Sales   a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year; 
                
    Operating Income   a measure of our profit from continuing operations for the year, before non-operating expenses, net and taxes; and 
                
    Operating Margin   a measure of our operating income as a percentage of total net sales. 

Backlog represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally converts into sales as we incur costs under the related contractual commitments. Therefore, we discuss changes in backlog, including any significant cancellations, for each of our segments, as we believe such discussion provides an understanding of the awarded but not executed portions of our contracts. 
    
  In addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash.   We pursue a capital deployment strategy that balances funding for growing our business, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development; prudently managing our balance sheet, including debt repayments and pension contributions; and returning cash to our shareholders, including dividend payments and share repurchases  . 
    
  We also focus on earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow (FCF) and return on invested capital (ROIC). 
    
  Considered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareholder value. We feel these measures are balanced among long-term and short-term performance, efficiency and growth. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. 
    
  A discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Consolidated Results of Operations; Segment Results; Financial Condition and Liquidity; and Capital Resources. 
    
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  Our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty; therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the estimates set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting estimates and represent the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate. However, if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded.

           Table of Contents  

   Revenue Recognition 
  We determine the appropriate revenue recognition method by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract or arrangement entered into with our customers. The significant estimates we make in recognizing revenue for the types of revenue-generating activities in which we are involved are described below. We classify contract revenues as product or service according to the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts unless the contract can clearly be split between product and service. We define service revenue as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development or production of tangible assets, the delivery of software code or a specific capability. Our service revenue is primarily related to our IIS business segment. 
    
  Percentage-of-Completion Accounting     We use the percentage-of-completion accounting method to account for our long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, such as certain cost-plus service contracts. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion of the long-term contract.     Our analysis of these contracts also contemplates whether contracts should be combined or segmented in accordance with the applicable criteria under U.S. GAAP. We combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under U.S. GAAP are met. The combination of two or more contracts requires judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single project, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if the applicable criteria under U.S. GAAP are met. Judgment also is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segmented based on how the arrangement was negotiated and the performance criteria. The decision to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period. 
    
  The selection of a method to measure progress toward completion of a contract also requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our long-term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress toward completion of the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Contract costs include labor, materials and subcontractors costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion (the process for which we describe below in more detail) is complex and subject to many variables. Incentive and award fees generally are awarded at the discretion of the customer or upon achievement of certain program milestones or cost targets. Incentive and award fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance, which may include the performance of subcontractors or partners depending on the individual contract requirements. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event generally are not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated.    
    
  We have a companywide standard and disciplined quarterly Estimate at Completion (EAC)   process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress toward completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities include management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product) and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (e.g., to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and related support cost allocations), performance by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, and overhead cost rates, among other variables. These estimates also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset obligations, required under certain contracts. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustments to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual contracts, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of those contracts or in realizing related opportunities. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be  

33 

           Table of Contents  

   successful in mitigating these risks or in realizing related     opportunities. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized quarterly on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts.     When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. 
    
  Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: 

Other Considerations   The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs are unallowable. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the allowability and allocation of costs to contracts for specific matters. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our U.S. government contracts are required to be recorded under U.S. GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income taxes, workers  compensation and certain other accruals. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. 
    
  Pension and other postretirement benefits (PRB) costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon the U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The CAS requirements for pension and PRB costs differ from the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP. Given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS income or expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity, and therefore did not defer any FAS expense for pension and PRB plans in   2013     2015  . This resulted in   $185 million      of income,    $286 million   of income and   $249 million   of   expense   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, reflected in our consolidated results of operations as the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension and PRB plans in those years. 
    
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (PRB) Costs 
  We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. We must calculate our pension and PRB costs under both U.S. government CAS requirements and FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP, and both calculations require judgment. U.S. GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension and PRB expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not indicative of the funding requirements for pension and PRB plans that we determine under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). CAS prescribes the allocation to and recovery of pension and PRB costs on U.S. government contracts. The CAS requirements for pension and PRB costs and its calculation methodology differ from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. As a result, while both CAS and FAS use long-term assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of pension and PRB cost. In addition, we are subject to the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), which amended ERISA. Under the PPA, we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the PPA calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities.  
    
  We record CAS expense in our business segment results. Due to the differences between FAS and CAS amounts, we also present the difference between FAS and CAS expense, referred to as our FAS/CAS Adjustment, as a separate line item in our segment results. This effectively increases or decreases the amount of total pension expense in our results of operations so that such amount is equal to the FAS expense amount under U.S. GAAP. Due to the foregoing differences in requirements  

34 

           Table of Contents  

   and calculation methodologies, our FAS pension expense or income is not indicative of the funding requirements or amount of government recovery. 
    
  On December 27, 2011, the CAS Pension Harmonization Rule (CAS Harmonization) was published in the Federal Register. The rule intends to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under CAS and the pension funding requirements under the PPA. The rule shortened the CAS amortization period for gains and losses from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, consistent with PPA, to measure liabilities in determining the CAS pension expense. CAS Harmonization increases pension costs under CAS and the related FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment results in an increase to income in 2014 and beyond, primarily due to the liability measurement transition period of 0% in 2013, 25% in 2014, 50% in 2015, 75% in 2016 and 100% in 2017 included in the rule.   Because CAS Harmonization is a mandatory change in cost accounting for government contractors, we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for some portion of the increase in costs on contracts which we are currently negotiating with the government. 
  In July 2012, the Surface Transportation Extension Act (STE Act), was passed by Congress and signed by the President. The STE Act includes a provision for temporary pension funding relief due to the low interest rate environment. The provision adjusts the 24-month average high quality corporate bond rates used to determine the PPA funded status so that they are within a floor and cap, or  corridor,  based on the 25-year average of corporate bond rates. The STE Act gradually phased out this interest rate provision beginning in 2013. Subsequent to the STE Act, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA) and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA) further extended this interest rate provision until 2020, at which time the provision is gradually phased out.   The STE, HATFA and BBA impact CAS expense as well because CAS Harmonization incorporates the PPA interest rate into CAS calculations.  
    
  The BBA also increases the insurance premiums that we are required to pay the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC). However, we do not expect the increases to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  The assumptions in the calculations of our pension FAS expense and CAS expense, which involve significant judgment, are described below. 
    
  FAS Expense   Our long-term return on plan assets (ROA) and discount rate assumptions are the key variables in determining pension expense or income and the funded status of our pension plans under U.S. GAAP. 
    
  The long-term ROA represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. The long-term ROA used to calculate net periodic pension cost is set annually at the beginning of each year. Given the long-term nature of the ROA assumption, which we believe should not be solely reactive to short-term market conditions that may not persist, we expect the long-term ROA to remain unchanged unless there are significant changes in our investment strategy, the underlying economic assumptions, or other major factors. To establish our long-term ROA assumption we employ a  building block  approach.    
    
  As part of our annual process for determining whether it is appropriate to change our long-term ROA assumption, we first review the existing long-term ROA assumption against a statistically determined reasonable range of outcomes. For purposes of determining the long-term ROA assumption for 2014 and prior, we considered this range to be between the 25th and 75th percentile likelihood of achieving a long-term return over future years, consistent with the Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 27, Selection of Economic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations (ASOP 27) in effect at the time. Therefore, it is less than 25% likely that the long-term return of the pension plan would fall below or above the 25th and 75th percentiles points, respectively (i.e., it is 50% likely that the long-term return of the pension plan will be within the 25th and 75th percentile range). In September 2013, the Actuarial Standards Board issued a revision to ASOP 27, that replaced the explicit reference to the best estimate range concept with the selection of a reasonable assumption that considers multiple criteria including the purposes of measurement, the actuary s professional judgment, historical and current economic data and estimates of future experience and has no significant bias. The revised standard is effective for assumptions established on or after September 30, 2014. As a result of the revised standard, we continue to evaluate our long-term ROA assumption against a reasonable range of possible outcomes but, effective for our 2015 and future years assumptions, we modified that range to be between the 35th to 65th percentile likelihood of achieving a long-term return over future years. We believe that continuing to validate our ROA assumption within a reasonable range that is narrowed to the 35th to 65th percentiles ensures an unbiased result while also ensuring that the ROA assumption is not solely reactive to short-term market conditions that may not persist, and is consistent with external actuarial practices. The building block approach and the reasonable range of outcomes are based  

35 

           Table of Contents  

   upon our asset allocation assumptions and long-term capital market assumptions. Such assumptions incorporate the economic outlook for various asset classes over short- and long-term periods and also take into consideration other factors, including historical market performance, inflation and interest rates.    
    
  The reasonable range of long-term returns that was used to validate the long-term ROA assumption for the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for     2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , are shown below.      

The long-term domestic ROA of 8.75% for 2014 and 2013 fell between the 60th 65th percentile and 65th 70th percentile of the applicable reasonable range for     2014   and   2013  , respectively. The 50th percentile of the reasonable range used to develop the     2014   and   2013     long-term ROA was 7.59% and 7.51%, respectively.    
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we reduced our long-term target allocation for equities and increased our target allocation for fixed income within the investment policy allocations established by our Investment Committee in order to reduce the overall exposure to equity volatility. This change in asset allocation reduced the range of reasonable outcomes that we use to evaluate our long-term ROA assumption and we determined that the historical assumption of 8.75% no longer fell within this range. To develop our 2015 long-term ROA assumption, we employed a building block approach. Under this building block method, the overall expected investment return equals the weighted-average of the individual expected return for each asset class based on the target asset allocation and the long-term capital market assumptions. The expected return for each asset class is composed of inflation plus a risk-free rate of return, plus an expected risk premium for that asset class. The resulting return is then adjusted for administrative, investment management and trading expenses as well as recognition of alpha for active management. The building block approach resulted in a long-term ROA assumption of 8.0% for 2015. To validate this assumption we compared the result against the reasonable range of outcomes and confirmed that the 8.0% result falls between the 55th 60th percentile of the reasonable range for 2015 with the 50th percentile at 7.37%. In addition, when we updated our target asset allocation and our long-term ROA assumption changed from 8.75% to 8.0%, we assessed what our historical asset performance may have been since 1986 using the updated target allocation and concluded the average return would likely have been equal to or greater than 8.0% for the time period from 1986 through 2014. 
    
  Based upon our application of the building block approach and our review of the resulting assumption against the 35th to 65th reasonable range and an analysis of our historical results, we have established a 2015 long-term ROA assumption of 8.0% and have determined that the new assumption is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of ASOP 27.   If we significantly change our long-term investment allocation or strategy, or if there is a significant change in the economic assumptions, then our long-term ROA assumption could change in the future. 
    
  The reasonable range of long-term returns used to validate our assumption for the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for 2016 is between 6.09% at the 35th percentile and 8.16% at the 65th percentile. The long-term ROA assumption of 8.0%, which is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost for 2016, falls between the 60th 65th percentile of the reasonable range results with the 50th percentile at 7.12%. 
    
  Once our long-term ROA has been determined to be within the 35th to 65th percentile range of results, we review historical averages and patterns of returns to confirm reasonability of our long-term ROA assumption compared to past results. While history is not solely indicative of future market expectations, it does provide insight into general historical trends and long-term asset performance. Our average annual actual rate of return from 1986 to   2015   of 8.88%, determined on an arithmetic basis, exceeds our estimated 8.0% assumed return. Arithmetic annual averages represent the simple average returns over independent annual periods, whereas geometric returns reflect the compound average returns of dependent annual periods. The average annual actual return on a geometric basis for the same period was 8.20%. In addition, the actual annual returns have exceeded our long-term ROA assumption of 8.0% in five of the past ten years.

           Table of Contents  

   Our domestic pension plans  actual rates of return were approximately 0%, 6% and 15% for     2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The difference between the actual rate of return and our long-term ROA assumption is included in deferred losses.    
    
  The investment policy asset allocation ranges for our domestic pension plans, as set by our Investment Committee, for the year ended December 31,   2015   were as follows:    

Our long-term ROA assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans are based on the asset allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of our Pension Benefits plans. 
    
  The discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and PRB obligations. The discount rate assumption is determined by using a theoretical bond portfolio model consisting of bonds rated AA or better by Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated benefit payments for each of our pension plans. The discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans at December 31,   2015   is   4.47%  , which represents a weighted-average discount rate across our plans, compared to the December 31,   2014   discount rate of   4.08%  . 
    
  CAS Expense   In addition to providing the methodology for calculating pension costs, CAS also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. The key drivers of CAS pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate CAS reimbursement for each of our plans. Under the prior CAS rules, the discount rate used to measure liabilities was required to be consistent with the long-term ROA assumption, which changes infrequently given its long-term nature. In addition to certain other changes, CAS Harmonization requires contractors to compare the liability under the prior CAS methodology and assumptions to a liability using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, and use the greater of the two liability calculations in developing CAS expense. In addition, unlike FAS, we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under CAS until such plan is fully funded as determined under CAS requirements. When the estimated future CAS pension costs increase, the estimated CAS cost allocated to our contracts in the future increases. 
    
  Other FAS and CAS Considerations   An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had the following approximate impacts on   2015   FAS pension results:

Changes in the high-quality corporate bond rate assumption could impact the CAS discount rate for purposes of determining CAS pension expense due to CAS Harmonization. However in   2015  , the CAS pension expense was not impacted by this assumption due to the passage of HATFA which extended the provisions of pension funding relief as described above. The discount rate assumption could impact CAS pension expense in future periods depending upon the interest rate and regulatory environments.

   An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the long-term ROA assumption would have had the following approximate impacts on   2015   FAS and CAS pension results: 

A 25 basis point increase or decrease in our long-term ROA assumption would result in a decrease or increase to our FAS pension expense by approximately   $46 million   for   2015  . In addition to the impact on our   2015   FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, a portion of the   $13 million   change in CAS pension expense would also be allocated to fixed-price contracts in backlog and would either increase or decrease the profit rate on those contracts at the time of such a change (i.e., a change in the long-term ROA assumption on January 1,   2015   would drive a change in estimated costs in EACs and related contract profit rates as of December 31,   2014  ). The contract impact resulting from the change in CAS pension expense is difficult to estimate because remaining performance periods can vary, the amount and timing of expected new awards (i.e., the proposals expected to be awarded in the year which will bear their allocated portion of the change in CAS pension expense), and our mix of fixed-price and cost reimbursable contracts can change. Based on our contract profile at December 31,   2014  , if we had 60% of our backlog in fixed-price contracts, and they were on average 50% complete, with our actual new award profile for   2015  , a 25 basis point change in our long-term ROA assumption at January 1,   2015   would drive approximately $2 million of aggregate total EAC adjustments at December 31,   2014  . In addition, our fixed-price contracts in backlog as of December 31, 2014 would have a lower profit rate in   2015  , resulting in approximately $1 million impact as costs are incurred in that year on those contracts. The total impact on   2014   would be approximately $2 million driven by the aggregate EAC adjustments and the total impact on   2015   would be approximately $34 million (the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment and the lower profit rate impact in   2015   on fixed-price contracts in backlog at December 31,   2014  ). A change in our long-term ROA assumption would be subject to review by our government customer for reasonableness. Given our history of recovering changes to CAS pension expense, we expect the assumption change would be allocable and allowable, per regulatory guidelines, as long as the assumption is reasonable. The transition to CAS Harmonization may gradually reduce the impact that a change to the long-term ROA assumption will have on CAS pension expense in future years as CAS Harmonization is phased in. 
    
  The impact of changing our long-term ROA for our domestic pension plans from 8.75% to 8.0% in   2015   increased our FAS expense by $140 million, increased our CAS expense by $40 million and decreased our FAS/CAS pension adjustment to income by $100 million in   2015  . This CAS impact to   2015   varies from the theoretical impact to   2015   described above because the CAS impact in any one year depends on the actual change in the long-term ROA and is not linear. The CAS impact is primarily driven by whether the pre-CAS Harmonization methodology applies, which uses a discount rate based on the long-term ROA assumption, or the post-CAS Harmonization methodology applies, which uses a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, and the corresponding relationship between the long-term ROA and the high-quality corporate bond rate. In addition, the timing of the change relative to the transition period for CAS Harmonization affects the CAS impact. The $40 million increase in our CAS expense in   2015   was included in our EACs and did not have a significant impact on our   2014   results based on our overall ending overhead positions. 
    
  In accordance with both FAS and CAS, a calculated  market-related value  of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is determined using actual asset gains or losses over a certain prior period (three years for FAS and five years for CAS, subject to certain limitations under CAS on the difference between the market-related value and actual market value of assets). Because of this difference in the number of years over which actual asset gains or losses are recognized and subsequently amortized, FAS expense generally tends to reflect recent asset gains or losses faster than CAS. Another driver of CAS expense (but not FAS expense) is the funded status of our pension plans under CAS. As noted above, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded; consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. 
    
  Under FAS,   a  corridor  approach may be elected and applied in the recognition of asset and liability gains or losses which limits expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the calculated "market-related value" of assets. We do not use a  corridor  approach in the calculation of FAS expense.

   Our Pension and PRB plan s investments are stated at fair value. Investments in equity securities (common and preferred) are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. Investments in fixed-income securities are generally valued using methods based upon market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are generally recognized by institutional traders. Investments in private equity funds, private real estate funds, and other commingled funds are estimated at fair market value which primarily utilizes net asset values reported by the investment manager or fund administrator. We review additional valuation and pricing information from the fund managers, including audited financial statements, to evaluate the net asset values.  
    
  The change in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) related to pension and PRB plans was as follows: 

The balance in AOCL related to our pension and PRB plans is composed primarily of differences between changes in discount rates, differences between actual and expected asset returns, differences between actual and assumed demographic experience, and changes in plan provisions. Changes to our pension and PRB obligation as a result of these variables are initially reflected in other comprehensive income. The deferred gains and losses are amortized and included in future pension expense over the average employee service period of approximately   10   years at   December 31, 2015  . The   $0.6 billion   in   2015   losses arising during the period were driven primarily by actual returns, which were lower than our expected return and had an impact of approximately $1.6 billion, as well as other actuarial factors, partially offset by the increase in the discount rate from   4.08%   at   December 31, 2014   to   4.47%   at   December 31, 2015  , which had an impact of approximately $1.2 billion.  
    
  The   $4.4 billion   in   2014   losses arising during the period were driven primarily by the decrease in the discount rate from   5.08%   at December 31,   2013   to   4.08%   at   December 31, 2014  , which had an impact of approximately $3.0 billion, and actual returns which were lower than our expected return and had an impact of approximately $0.3 billion, as well as other actuarial factors including mortality. The mortality assumption is the basis for determining the longevity of our pension participants and the expected period over which they will receive pension benefits. A 2014 study released by the Society of Actuaries indicated that life expectancies have increased over the past several years and are longer than what was assumed by most existing mortality tables. Since December, 31, 2014, our pension obligations reflect a change in the underlying mortality assumption, which reflects improvements in life expectancy consistent with the Society of Actuaries 2014 study. In addition, these pension obligations reflect an increase in the expected rate of future longevity improvement taking into consideration data from multiple sources including the Society of Actuaries 2014 study and Social Security Administration data. These changes resulted in an increase in our projected benefit obligation of $0.6 billion as of   December 31, 2014  .  
    
  The   $3.0 billion   in   2013   gains arising during the period were driven primarily by the increase in the discount rate from 4.15% at December 31,   2012   to   5.08%   at   December 31, 2013  , which had an impact of approximately $2.4 billion and actual returns, which were higher than our expected return, which had an impact of approximately $1.1 billion, partially offset by other actuarial factors. 
    
  Goodwill 
  We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter and in any interim period in which circumstances arise that indicate our goodwill may be impaired. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant decreases in federal government appropriations or funding for our contracts, or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. No events occurred during the periods presented that indicated the existence of an impairment with respect to our goodwill. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on our most recent long-range plan in place at the time of our impairment testing, and compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. We discount the cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. The weighted-average cost of capital is comprised of the estimated required rate of return on equity, based on publicly available data for peer companies, plus an equity risk premium related to specific company risk factors, and the after-tax rate of return on debt, weighted at the relative values of the estimated debt and equity for the industry. Preparation of forecasts for use in the long-range plan and

           Table of Contents  

   the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Significant changes in these forecasts or the discount rate selected could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. When available and as appropriate, we also use comparative market multiples to corroborate our DCF model results. There was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of our   2015   annual impairment analysis, as the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, including goodwill.  
    
  In May 2015, we completed a series of transactions with Vista Equity Partners by which we acquired Websense and combined it with RCP, formerly part of our IIS segment, and then sold a minority interest in the combined company to Vista Equity Partners to establish Forcepoint, a new cybersecurity joint venture company (with Vista Equity Partners).   In connection with these transactions, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure with Forcepoint as our fifth reporting segment. Our Forcepoint reporting unit, the majority of which was acquired in the second quarter of 2015, had a fair value in excess of net book value, including goodwill, of greater than 10%. All other factors equal, a 10% decrease in expected future cash flows for our Forcepoint reporting unit would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 3%. Alternatively, all other factors being equal, a 100 basis points increase in the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of our Forcepoint reporting unit would also result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 3%. Based on our   2015   impairment analysis of the other reporting units, the reporting unit that was closest to impairment had a fair value in excess of net book value, including goodwill, of approximately   85%  . All other factors equal, a 10% decrease in expected future cash flows for that reporting unit would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 70%. Alternatively, all other factors being equal, a 100 basis points increase in the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of that reporting unit would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 55%. If we are required to record an impairment charge in the future, it could materially affect our results of operations. 
    
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
   In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We have elected to early adopt this requirement retrospectively in the current period. We reclassified $165 million of net current deferred income tax liabilities from current to noncurrent at December 31, 2014.     
    
   In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent),   which, for all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, removes the requirement to make certain disclosures and to categorize them within the fair value hierarchy. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We have elected to early adopt this requirement retrospectively in the current period.  
    
   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We have elected to early adopt this requirement retrospectively in the current period. We reclassified $5 million of debt issuance costs from other assets, net, to a reduction of long-term debt at December 31, 2014.     
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606) which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new standard, we expect to continue using the cost-to-cost percentage of completion method to recognize revenue for most of our long-term contracts. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential changes from this ASU to our future financial reporting and disclosures. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the new standard's effective date by one year. The new standard now  

40 

           Table of Contents  

   would be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB will permit companies to adopt the new standard early, but not before the original effective date of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016  .  
    
  Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after     December 31, 2015     are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
    
    CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
    
    Total Net Sales 
  The composition of external net sales by products and services for each segment in   2015   was approximately the following: 

(1) Products net sales includes software related sales, including software subscriptions. 

Total Net Sales -   2015   vs.   2014   The   increase   in total net sales of   $421 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher external net sales of   $328 million   at IDS,   $244 million   at MS and $159 million at Forcepoint including the unfavorable impact of the deferred revenue adjustment recorded at Corporate, partially offset by lower external net sales of   $212 million   at SAS and   $98 million   at IIS. The increase in external net sales at IDS was primarily due to   higher net sales     from an international Patriot program awarded in the second quarter of 2015 driven by program activity and the recognition of previously deferred precontract costs,     higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014,     higher net sales on the Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) program driven by additional scope awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014 and higher net change in EAC adjustments as discussed   below in Segment Results  , and     higher net sales from an international air and missile defense system program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to scheduled production phases.     The higher net sales   at IDS   were partially offset by lower net sales     from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on various Patriot programs for international customers and     from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on our missile defense radar programs.   The increase in external net sales at MS was primarily due to   higher net sales on the Paveway  program principally driven by international requirements,     higher net sales on the Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wireless-guided (TOW ) missile program primarily due to planned increases in production, and     higher net sales on certain air and missile defense programs primarily due to a contract awarded in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by     lower net sales on the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3 ) program primarily due to the planned transition from development to production.   The increase in external net sales at Forcepoint was primarily due to   higher sales   of   $160 million     resulting from the acquisition of Websense   in the second quarter of 2015, including the unfavorable impact of the deferred revenue adjustment recorded at Corporate. Included in the change in external net sales at SAS was   lower net sales     primarily due to reduced schedule requirements on international tactical radar systems programs, lower intersegment sales     driven by lower volume on contracts supporting radar programs, and higher net sales     on classified programs  .   The remaining change in total net sales   at SAS   was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.   The decrease in external net sales at IIS was primarily due to   lower net sales     on training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities due to a decrease in customer-determined activity levels and lower net sales     on a classified program for an international customer, partially offset by higher net sales     on cybersecurity and special missions programs excluding a classified program for an international customer, primarily driven by the fourth quarter of 2014 acquisition of Raytheon Blackbird Technologies (RBT).    
    
  Products and Services Net Sales -   2015   vs.   2014   The   increase   in products net sales of   $317 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher external products net sales of   $262 million   at MS,   $186 million   at IDS, and $161 million at Forcepoint, partially offset by lower external products net sales of   $169 million   at IIS and   $123 million   at SAS. The increase  

41 

           Table of Contents  

   in external products net sales at MS and IDS was primarily due to the programs discussed above. The increase in external products net sales at Forcepoint was principally driven by the acquisition of Websense. The decrease in external products net sales at IIS was primarily due to lower net sales on a classified program for an international customer. The decrease in external products net sales at SAS was primarily due to the international tactical radar systems programs discussed above. The   increase   in services net sales of   $104 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher external services net sales of   $142 million   at IDS, driven principally by higher services net sales on radar sustainment programs for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and new service program awards, partially offset by lower services net sales on various other programs. 
    
  Total Net Sales -   2014   vs.   2013   The   decrease   in total net sales of   $880 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to lower external net sales of   $404 million   at IDS and   $267 million   at MS. The   decrease   in external net sales at IDS was primarily due to   lower net sales     from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on various Patriot programs for international customers  ,   lower net sales     on a close combat tactical radar program due to planned decreases in production   and   lower net sales     on a missile defense radar program for an international customer also due to planned decreases in production.   The   decrease   in external net sales at IDS was   partially offset by     higher net sales from an international air defense system program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013  ,   higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the first quarter of 2014   and   higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014 driven primarily by previously deferred precontract costs.   The remaining   decrease   at IDS   was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.   The   decrease   in external net sales at MS was primarily due to lower net sales on land warfare systems programs driven principally by planned declines in production due to the U.S. Army budget environment. 
    
  Products and Services Net Sales -   2014   vs.   2013   The   decrease   in products net sales of   $729 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to lower external products net sales of   $403 million   at IDS and   $263 million   at MS, both driven principally by the programs described above. The   decrease   in services net sales of   $151 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to lower external service net sales at IIS of   $118 million  , driven principally by lower net sales on training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities resulting from a decrease in customer-determined activity levels. 
    
  Sales to Major Customers   The following is a breakdown of net sales to major customers: 

(1) 
    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 
              (2) 
    Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 
       
  As described above in Industry Considerations, U.S. defense spending levels are difficult to predict due to numerous factors, including U.S. government budget appropriation decisions, geopolitical events and macroeconomic conditions. 
    
    Total Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists of labor, materials and subcontractors costs, as well as related allocated costs. For each of our contracts, we manage the nature and amount of direct costs at the contract level, and manage indirect costs through cost pools as required by government accounting regulations. The estimate of the actual amount of direct and indirect costs forms the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of the contract.

Total Cost of Sales -   2015   vs.   2014   The   increase   in total cost of sales of   $279 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher external cost of sales of   $378 million   at IDS and   $114 million   at MS and $101 million of higher expense related to the FAS/CAS Adjustment as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   48  , partially offset by lower external cost of sales of   $255 million   at IIS and   $181 million   at SAS. The increases in external cost of sales at IDS and MS were driven principally by the activity on the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in external cost of sales at IIS was driven principally by a $181 million impact from the eBorders settlement in 2015. In March 2015, Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL) reached a settlement with the UK Home Office concluding the parties' dispute regarding the UK Home Office's July 2010 termination of RSL's eBorders contract within our IIS segment. The settlement included a cash payment from the UK Home Office to RSL of    150 million   (approximately   $226 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of the settlement date) for the resolution of all claims and counterclaims of both parties related to the matter. After certain expenses and derecognition of the outstanding receivables, IIS recorded   $181 million   in operating income through a reduction in cost of sales. The decrease in external cost of sales at SAS was primarily due to the programs described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
  Products and Services Cost of Sales -   2015   vs.   2014   The   increase   in products cost of sales of   $187 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher external products cost of sales of   $268 million   at IDS and   $127 million   at MS, $83 million of higher expense related to the FAS/CAS Adjustment as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   48   and   $52 million   of higher expense related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with Forcepoint as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   48  . The increases in external products cost of sales at IDS and MS were driven principally by the activity on the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The increases in products cost of sales were partially offset by a decrease in external products cost of sales of   $302 million   at IIS and   $109 million   at SAS. The decrease in external products cost of sales at IIS was principally driven by a $181 million impact from the eBorders settlement described above. The decrease in external products cost of sales at SAS was primarily due to the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The increase in services cost of sales of   $92 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher external services cost of sales of   $110 million   at IDS, driven principally by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
  Total Cost of Sales -   2014   vs.   2013   The   decrease   in total cost of sales of   $1,237 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to a   $535 million   change in the FAS/CAS Adjustment and lower external cost of sales of   $271 million   at MS and   $233 million   at IDS. The change in the FAS/CAS Adjustment was primarily driven by a   $345 million     decrease   in our FAS pension expense and by a   $189 million     increase   in our CAS pension expense, which is included in the results of each segment and generally recovered through pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The changes in both our FAS expense and CAS expense are described in our Segment Results beginning on page   48  . The decreases in external cost of sales at MS and IDS were driven principally by the activity on the programs described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
  Products and Services Cost of Sales -   2014   vs.   2013   The   decrease   in products cost of sales of   $1,032 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   $441 million   of lower expense related to the FAS/CAS Adjustment described above and lower external products cost of sales of   $272 million   at MS and   $229 million   at IDS. The decreases in external products cost of sales at MS and IDS were principally driven by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The   decrease   in services cost of sales of   $205 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   $94 million   of lower expense related to the FAS/CAS Adjustment described above and lower external services cost of sales of   $82 million   at IIS, principally driven by activity on training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities due to a decrease in customer-determined activity levels.

   General and Administrative Expenses 

The   increase   in administrative and selling expenses of   $102 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily driven by a   $90 million   increase in selling and marketing expenses at Forcepoint principally driven by the acquisition of Websense. Included in administrative and selling expenses in   2015   was   $26 million   of Websense transaction and integration-related costs recorded at Corporate as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   48  . Included in administrative and selling expenses in   2014   was   $25 million   of stock-based compensation expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock units (RSUs) as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   48  . 
    
  The   increase   in administrative and selling expenses of   $81 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   includes the   $25 million   of stock-based compensation expense associated with RSUs issued in 2014 as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   48  . There was no other individual or common significant driver of the increase in administrative and selling expenses. 
    
  Included in administrative and selling expenses is the provision for state income taxes, which generally can be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Net state income taxes allocated to our contracts were   $28 million  ,   $41 million   and   $42 million   in   2015  ,   2014  , and   2013  , respectively. 
    
  The   increase   in research and development expenses of   $206 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher independent research and development activity, principally driven by   $79 million   at MS related to advanced capabilities, and increased research and development expenses of   $52 million   at Forcepoint driven by our acquisition of Websense and development on new commercial products. 
    
  The   increase   in research and development expenses of   $35 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   higher independent research and development activity related to electronic warfare technology  . 
    
  Total Operating Expenses 

The   increase   in total operating expenses of   $587 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the   increase   in total cost of sales of   $279 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Cost of Sales, and the increase in research and development expenses of   $206 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in General and Administrative Expenses. 
    
  The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $1,121 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the   decrease   in total cost of sales of   $1,237 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Cost of Sales. 
    
    Operating Income 

The   decrease   in operating income of   $166 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was due to the   increase   in total operating expenses of   $587 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Operating Expenses, partially offset by the   increase   in total net sales of   $421 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Net Sales.

           Table of Contents  

   The   increase   in operating income of   $241 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was due to the   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $1,121 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Operating Expenses, offset by the   decrease   in total net sales of   $880 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
    Total Non-Operating (Income) Expense, Net 

The   increase   in total non-operating (income) expense, net, of   $30 million   in   2015   compared to   2014  , was primarily due to   $20 million   of higher interest expense in   2015  , principally driven by the issuance of $600 million of fixed-rate long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $12 million change in the fair value of marketable securities held in trust associated with certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, due to net losses of $1 million in   2015   compared to net gains of $11 million in   2014  . 
    
  The   increase   in total non-operating (income) expense, net, of   $15 million   in   2014   compared to   2013  , was primarily due to a $10 million change in the fair value of marketable securities held in trust associated with certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, due to net gains of $11 million in   2014   compared to net gains of $21 million in   2013  . 
    
    Federal and Foreign Income Taxes 

The   decrease   in federal and foreign income taxes of   $57 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a decrease in operating income. The   decrease   in federal and foreign income taxes of   $18 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the 2014 tax benefit of the foreign dividend described in more detail in "Note 15: Income Taxes" within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, offset by an increase in operating income. 
    
  Our effective tax rate, which is used to determine federal and foreign income tax expense, differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following:    

Our effective tax rate reflects the   35%   U.S. statutory rate adjusted for various permanent differences between book and tax reporting. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted to permanently reinstate the Research and Development tax credit (R D tax credit) which had expired December 31, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a full year benefit of approximately   $33 million   related to the 2015 R D tax credit. In 2014, we recorded a full year benefit of approximately   $30 million   related to the 2014 R D tax credit. 

45 

           Table of Contents  

   Our effective tax rate in   2015   was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to tax settlements and refunds which decreased the rate by approximately   3.2%  , the domestic manufacturing deduction which decreased the rate by approximately   3.1%  , the foreign rate differential which decreased the rate by   1.4%   and was primarily driven by the tax impact of the eBorders settlement, and the reinstatement of the R D tax credit which decreased the rate by approximately   1.2%  . The remaining increase of   0.2%   is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant. 
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2014   was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefit on the foreign dividend which decreased the rate by approximately   2.8%  , the domestic manufacturing deduction which decreased the rate by approximately   2.7%  , the reinstatement of the R D tax credit which decreased the rate by approximately   1.1%  , the foreign rate differential which decreased the rate by   0.6%   and tax settlements and refunds which decreased the rate by approximately   0.5%  .The remaining decrease of   0.8%   is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant.  
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2013   was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the domestic manufacturing deduction which decreased the rate by approximately   2.1%  , the R D tax credit which decreased the rate by approximately   1.8%   and tax settlements and refunds which decreased the rate by approximately   0.8%  . The remaining decrease of   1.0%   is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant.  
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2015   was   0.2%     lower   than in   2014   primarily due to the tax settlements and refunds which decreased the rate by approximately   2.7%  , partially offset by the 2014 tax benefit on the foreign dividend which increased the rate by approximately   2.8%  . The remaining decrease of 0.3% is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant. 
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2014   was   2.8%   lower than in   2013   primarily due to the tax benefit on the foreign dividend, which decreased the rate by approximately   2.8%  , partially offset by the R D tax credit which increased the rate by approximately   0.7%  . The remaining decrease of 0.7% is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant. 
    
    Income from Continuing Operations 

The   decrease   in income from continuing operations of   $139 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the   $166 million     decrease   in operating income, described above in Operating Income. 
    
  The   increase   in income from continuing operations of   $244 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the   $241 million     increase   in operating income, described above in Operating Income. 
    
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 

The   decrease   in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of   $52 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a gain of $52 million in   2014   related to the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under CAS 413 for previously divested operations. 
    
  Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in   2014   was relatively consistent with   2013  . Included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2014 was a gain of $52 million related to the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under CAS 413 for previously divested operations as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   48  . 
    
  In 2010, we recorded a     $39 million     charge, net of federal tax benefit, in discontinued operations related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessing Flight Options LLC (Flight Options) for excise taxes. We contested the matter through litigation, and  

46 

           Table of Contents  

   in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement and recorded a   $33 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement regarding certain tax audits associated with our divestiture of Raytheon Aircraft Company and recorded a     $25 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations.    
    
  Net Income 

The   decrease   in net income of   $191 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the   decrease   in income from continuing operations of   $139 million   described above in Income from Continuing Operations. 
    
  The   increase   in net income of   $245 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was due to the   increase   in income from continuing operations of   $244 million   described above in Income from Continuing Operations. 
    
    Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders 

The   decrease   in diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders of   $0.22   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the   decrease   in income from continuing operations described above in Income from Continuing Operations, partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average shares outstanding, which was driven by the common stock share activity shown in the table below. The increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders of   $1.01   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations described above in Income from Continuing Operations. 
    
  Our common stock share activity for the years ended   2015  ,   2014  , and   2013   was as follows: 

Diluted EPS from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders 
  Diluted EPS from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders were earnings of   $0.04  ,   $0.21   and   $0.20   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The   decrease   of   $0.17   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. government in the second quarter of 2014 described above in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax. Diluted EPS from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders in   2014   was relatively consistent with   2013  .

   The   decrease   in diluted EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders of   $0.38   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the   $0.22     decrease   in diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders described above in Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders and the   $0.17     decrease   in diluted EPS from discontinued operations described above in Diluted EPS from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders. The   increase   of   $1.02   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the   increase   in diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders of   $1.01   described above in Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders. 
    
    SEGMENT RESULTS 
  In May 2015, we completed a series of transactions with Vista Equity Partners by which we acquired Websense and combined it with RCP, formerly part of our IIS segment, and then sold a minority interest in the combined company to Vista Equity Partners to establish Forcepoint, a new cybersecurity joint venture company (with Vista Equity Partners).      In connection with these transactions, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure with Forcepoint as our fifth reporting segment.   We report our results in the following segments: IDS; IIS; MS; SAS; and Forcepoint.  
    
  The amounts, discussion and presentation of our business segments, including Corporate and eliminations for intersegment activity, set forth in this Form 10-K, reflect the Forcepoint transaction. The Forcepoint results reflect RCP results for all periods and Websense results after the acquisition date of May 29, 2015.   None of the changes impact our previously reported consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows. See "Note 16: Business Segment Reporting" within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
    
  In addition, effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized certain product areas of our IDS and IIS businesses to more efficiently leverage our capabilities, but because this change occurred after December 31, 2015, the amounts, discussion and presentation of our financial results for purposes of this Form 10-K do not reflect this change. Rather, our structure as of December 31, 2015 is reflected.    
    
  The following provides some context for viewing our segment performance through the eyes of management. 
    
  Given the nature of our business, bookings, net sales, and operating income (and the related operating margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management s view of our segment performance, and often these measures have significant interrelated effects, as described below. In addition, we disclose and discuss backlog, which represents future sales that we expect to recognize over the remaining contract period, which is generally several years. We also disclose cost of sales and the components of cost of sales within our segment disclosures. 
    
  Bookings   We disclose the amount of bookings and notable contract awards for each segment. Bookings generally represent the dollar value of new contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. We believe bookings are an important measure of future performance and are an indicator of potential future changes in total net sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period.  
    
  Bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period, which are subject to numerous factors, including the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs; fiscal constraints placed on customer budgets; political uncertainty; the timing of customer negotiations; the timing of governmental approvals and notifications; and the timing of option exercises or increases in scope. In addition, due to these factors, quarterly bookings tend to fluctuate from period to period, particularly on a segment basis. As a result, we believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or for periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods and that shorter term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend. 

48 

           Table of Contents  

Included in bookings were international bookings of   $8,511 million  ,   $8,362 million   and   $6,604 million   in   2015  ,   2014  , and   2013  , respectively, which included foreign military bookings through the U.S. government. International bookings amounted to   34%  ,   35%   and   30%   of total bookings in   2015  ,   2014  , and   2013  , respectively. Classified bookings amounted to   15%   of total bookings in   2015   and   2014   and   13%   of total bookings in   2013  .  
    
  We record bookings for not-to-exceed contract awards (e.g., undefinitized contract awards, binding letter agreements) based on reasonable estimates of expected contract definitization, which generally will not be less than 75% of the award. We subsequently adjust bookings to reflect the actual amounts definitized, or, when prior to definitization, when facts and circumstances indicate that our previously estimated amounts are no longer reasonable. The timing of awards that may cover multiple fiscal years influences the size of bookings in each year. Bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts), and are reduced for contract cancellations and terminations of bookings recognized in the current year. We reflect contract cancellations and terminations from prior year bookings, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. 
    
  Backlog   We disclose period-ending backlog for each segment.   Backlog represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally converts into sales as we incur costs under the related contractual commitments. Therefore, we discuss changes in backlog, including any significant cancellations, for each of our segments, as we believe such discussion provides an understanding of the awarded but not executed portions of our contracts.       

(1)  
    Forcepoint total backlog excludes the unfavorable impact of the acquisition accounting adjustments to record acquired deferred revenue at fair value. 
       
  Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer but for which work has not been performed) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer and for which work has not been performed). Revenue is generally not recognized on backlog until funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ). Both funded and unfunded backlog are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
    
  Total Net Sales   We generally express changes in net sales in terms of volume. Volume generally refers to increases or decreases in revenues related to varying amounts of total operating expenses, which are comprised of cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, which include administrative and selling expenses (including bid and proposal costs) and research and development expenses incurred on individual contracts (i.e., from performance against contractual commitments on our bookings related to engineering, production or service activity). Therefore, we discuss volume changes attributable principally to individual programs or product lines unless there is a discrete event (e.g., a major contract termination, natural disaster or major labor strike), or some other unusual item that has a material effect on changes in a segment's volume for a reported period. Due to the nature of our contracts, the amount of costs incurred and related revenues will naturally fluctuate over the  

49 

           Table of Contents  

   lives of our contracts. As a result, in any reporting period, the changes in volume on numerous contracts are likely to be due to normal fluctuations in our engineering, production or service activities.  
    
  Total net sales by segment were as follows: 

(1) 
     Excludes the unfavorable impact of the acquisition accounting adjustments to record acquired deferred revenue at fair value related to Forcepoint, including historical RCP acquisitions. These amounts are included in Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments.  
        
  Total Operating Expenses   We generally disclose operating expenses for each segment in terms of the following: 1) cost of sales labor; 2) cost of sales materials and subcontractors; and 3) other costs of sales and other operating expenses. Included in cost of sales labor is the incurred direct labor associated with the performance of contracts in the current period and any applicable overhead and fringe costs. Included in cost of sales materials and subcontractors is the incurred direct materials, subcontractor costs (which could include effort performed by other Raytheon segments or locations), and applicable overhead allocations in the current period. Included in other cost of sales and other operating expenses is other direct costs not captured in labor or material and subcontractor costs, such as precontract costs previously deferred, costs previously deferred into inventory on contracts using commercial or units of delivery accounting, applicable overhead allocations, general and administrative expenses, which include administrative and selling expenses (including bid and proposal costs) and research and development expenses, other direct costs (such as ancillary services and travel expenses) and adjustments for loss contracts. 
    
  Operating Income (and the related operating margin percentage)   We generally express changes in segment operating income in terms of volume, net changes in EAC adjustments or changes in contract mix and other program performance.  
    
  The impact of changes in volume on operating income excludes the impact of net EAC adjustments and the impact of changes in contract mix and other program performance and is calculated based on changes in costs on individual programs at an overall margin for the segment. 
    
  Changes in net EAC adjustments typically relate to the current period impact of revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to our Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page   32  . Given that we have over   15,000   individual contracts and the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis, as discussed above, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments. We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented: 

In recent years, our net EAC adjustments generally have been between 1.5% and 2.5% of total net sales. For   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , our net EAC adjustments as a percentage of total net sales were   1.6%  ,   2.2%   and   2.3%  , respectively. 
    
  Significant EAC adjustments in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   are discussed in the Operating Income and Margin section of each business segment's discussion below. The   $142 million     decrease   in net EAC adjustments in   2015   compared to   2014   was  

50 

           Table of Contents  

   primarily due to the decrease in net EAC adjustments at SAS as described beginning on page 59. The   $44 million     decrease   in net EAC adjustments in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the decrease in net EAC adjustments at IDS as described beginning on page 51. 
    
  Changes in contract mix and other program performance refer to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes, and other drivers of program performance including margin rate increases or decreases due to EAC adjustments in prior periods. A higher or lower expected fee rate at the initial award of a contract typically correlates to the contract's risk profile, which is often specifically driven by the type of customer and related procurement regulations, the type of contract (e.g., fixed-price vs. cost-plus), the maturity of the product or service and the scope of work. Changes in contract mix and other performance also include all other items which are not related to volume or EAC adjustments. 
    
  Because each segment has thousands of contracts in any reporting period, changes in operating income and margin are likely to be due to normal changes in volume, net EAC adjustments, and contract mix and other performance on many contracts with no single change, or series of related changes, materially driving a segment's change in operating income or operating margin percentage.  
    
  Operating income by segment was as follows:

  Total Net Sales   The   increase   in total net sales of   $290 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to   higher net sales   of $385 million   from an international Patriot program awarded in the second quarter of 2015 driven by program activity and the recognition of previously deferred precontract costs,   $320 million of   higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014,   $161 million of   higher net sales on the Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) program driven by additional scope awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014 and higher net change in EAC adjustments as discussed   below  , and   $144 million of   higher net sales from an international air and missile defense system program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to scheduled production phases.     The higher net sales     were partially offset by lower net sales   of $510 million   from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on various Patriot programs for international customers and   $227 million   from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on our missile defense radar programs.    
    
  The   decrease   in net sales of   $404 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   lower net sales   of $441 million   from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on various Patriot programs for international customers  , $134 million   on a close combat tactical radar program due to planned decreases in production  , and $134 million   on a missile defense radar program for an international customer also due to planned decreases in production.   The   decrease   was   partially offset by   $203 million of   higher net sales from an international air defense system program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013  , $154 million of   higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the first quarter of 2014   and $135 million of   higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014 driven primarily by previously deferred precontract costs.   The remaining decrease   was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.    
    
  Total Operating Expenses   The   increase   in total operating expenses of   $347 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to an   increase   in materials and subcontractors costs of   $328 million  , driven principally by the activity on the international Patriot program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the international air and missile defense system program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013 described above in Total Net Sales.  
    
  The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $263 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to a   decrease   in labor costs of   $233 million  , principally driven by the activity on the various Patriot programs for international customers and the missile defense radar program for an international customer described above in Total Net Sales, partially offset by increased labor costs on a naval radar program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013.  
    
  Operating Income and Margin   The   decrease   in operating income of   $57 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of   $101 million  , partially offset by an increase in volume of   $60 million  . The  

52 

           Table of Contents  

   change in mix and other performance was principally driven by lower volume on the various Patriot programs for international customers, partially offset by higher volume on the international Patriot program awarded in the second quarter of 2015, both of which are described above in Total Net Sales. The increase in volume was primarily due to the activity on the programs described above in Total Net Sales.  
    
  The net change in EAC adjustments in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to net EAC adjustments of approximately $72 million in 2014 driven primarily by the reduction of expected costs to fulfill contractual commitments on nine contracts related to industrial cooperation agreements for an international customer as further discussed below, partially offset by a net increase in EAC adjustments of $59 million on our AWD program primarily driven by the adjustments discussed below. Prior to a contract modification and restructure of the AWD program in the fourth quarter of 2015, our incentives fees were tied directly to both our cost performance and the cost performance of the shipyard. This resulted in an unfavorable EAC adjustment in the second quarter of 2014 of $38 million from a decrease in estimated incentive fees driven by an increase in expected costs by the shipbuilder to complete its portion of the program and a further EAC adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 of $33 million to eliminate all remaining estimated incentive fees due to the shipbuilder further extending the planned schedule and a related increase in costs to complete its portion of the program. The contract modification and restructure of the AWD program in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in a change in the incentive fee structure such that almost all of our incentive fees are now tied solely to our performance which resulted in a favorable $53 million EAC adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating margin in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the change in mix and other performance. 
    
  The   decrease   in operating income of   $141 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was due to net change in EAC adjustments of   $55 million  , decreased volume of   $47 million   and a change in mix and other performance of   $39 million  . The net change in EAC adjustments was primarily due to a $35 million change in net adjustments on the AWD program primarily driven by a $38 million adjustment for a decrease in estimated incentive fees in the second quarter of 2014 due to an increase in expected costs by the shipbuilder to complete their portion of the program, and a $28 million change in net adjustments on an integrated air and missile defense program driven by an increase in estimated costs due to higher expected effort than previously planned, partially offset by a $30 million change in net adjustments related to the industrial cooperation agreements for an international customer discussed below. The remaining change in net EAC adjustments was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver. 
    
  Included in net EAC adjustments was approximately $72 million in 2014 compared to $42 million in 2013 driven primarily by the reduction of expected costs to fulfill contractual commitments on nine contracts related to industrial cooperation agreements for an international customer driven by favorable experience in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. One of these contracts in the fourth quarter of 2014 had an adjustment of $36 million, driven almost entirely by the reduction of expected costs related to the industrial cooperation agreements. Another one of these contracts in the fourth quarter of 2014 had an adjustment of $35 million, of which $22 million was driven by the reduction of expected costs related to the industrial cooperation agreements and the remainder of which was driven by favorable cost performance. 
    
  The decrease in volume in   2014   compared to   2013   was driven principally by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The change in mix and other performance in   2014   compared to   2013   was principally driven by lower net sales on various Patriot programs for international customers described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in operating margin in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the net change in EAC adjustments and the change in mix and other performance. 
    
  Backlog and Bookings   Backlog was   $11,842 million  ,   $11,495 million   and   $10,916 million   at   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The   increase   in backlog of   $347 million   or   3%   at   December 31, 2015   compared to   December 31, 2014   was primarily due to the 2015 international Patriot bookings in our Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) product line described below, partially offset by sales in excess of bookings spread across our other product lines. The   increase   in backlog of   $579 million   at   December 31, 2014   compared to   December 31, 2013   was primarily due to bookings in excess of sales in   2014  , principally across our IAMD product line.

  Total Net Sales   The   decrease   in total net sales of   $156 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to   lower net sales   of $129 million   on training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities due to a decrease in customer-determined activity levels and lower net sales   of $122 million   on a classified program for an international customer, partially offset by higher net sales   of $127 million   on cybersecurity and special missions programs excluding a classified program for an international customer, primarily driven by the fourth quarter of 2014 acquisition of Raytheon Blackbird Technologies (RBT).    
    
  Total net sales in   2014   were relatively consistent with   2013  . Included in total net sales was $151 million of lower net sales on training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities resulting from a decrease in customer-determined activity levels. Also included in total net sales was $245 million of higher net sales on classified programs. The remaining change in total net sales was spread across numerous programs primarily driven by the domestic budget environment.  
    
  Total Operating Expenses   The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $260 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a   decrease   in materials and subcontractors costs of   $179 million   and a decrease in other cost of sales and other operating expenses of   $175 million  . The decrease in materials and subcontractors costs was driven principally by the activity on the training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities and the classified program for an international customer described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in other cost of sales and other operating expenses was driven principally by the $181 million impact from the eBorders settlement as described in Consolidated Results of Operations beginning on page 41. 
    
  Total operating expenses in   2014   were relatively consistent with   2013  . Included in total operating expenses was an increase in other cost of sales and other operating expenses of   $62 million  , primarily due to the timing of costs applied to contracts through rates, which had an impact of $38 million. 
    
  Operating Income and Margin   The   increase   in operating income of   $104 million   and the related increase in operating margin in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of   $140 million  , principally driven by the $181 million impact from the eBorders settlement. The remaining change in mix and other performance in   2015   compared to the   2014   was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver. The net change in EAC adjustments was primarily due to a $44 million net change in EAC adjustments driven principally by higher than expected costs for the classified program for an international customer described above in Total Net Sales, partially offset by a $15 million net change in EAC adjustments due to favorable performance on various mission support and modernization

  Total Net Sales   The   increase   in total net sales of   $247 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to $98 million of   higher net sales on the Paveway  program principally driven by international requirements,   $97 million of   higher net sales on the Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wireless-guided (TOW ) missile program primarily due to planned increases in production, and   $90 million of   higher net sales on certain air and missile defense programs primarily due to a contract awarded in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by   $120 million of   lower net sales on the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3 ) program primarily due to the planned transition from development to production.    
    
  The   decrease   in total net sales of   $290 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to $298 million of lower net sales on land warfare systems programs driven principally by planned declines in production due to the U.S. Army budget environment. 
    
  Total Operating Expenses   The   increase   in total operating expenses of   $180 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to an   increase   in materials and subcontractors costs of   $99 million   driven principally by the activity on the TOW  program described above in Total Net Sales and activity on the Phalanx  program driven by planned increases in production, partially offset by activity on the SM-3  program described above in Total Net Sales. Included in the change in other cost of sales and other operating expenses was an increase in research and development expenses of   $79 million   principally related to advanced capabilities. 
    
  The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $260 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to a   decrease   in other cost of sales and other operating expenses of   $105 million   and a   decrease   in labor costs of   $75 million  , both driven principally by the land warfare systems programs as described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
  Operating Income and Margin   The   increase   in operating income of   $67 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of   $34 million   and an increase in volume of   $21 million  . The change in mix and other performance was driven principally by higher volume on the Paveway  program described above in Total Net Sales, with the remaining change spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver. The increase in volume was driven principally by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. Included in the net change in EAC adjustments was a $25 million favorable resolution of a contractual issue in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in operating margin in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the change in mix and other performance and the net change in EAC adjustments.

  Total Net Sales   Total net sales   decrease  d   $276 million   in   2015   compared to   2014  . Included in the change in total net sales was   lower net sales   of $111 million   primarily due to reduced schedule requirements on international tactical radar systems programs, lower intersegment sales   of $65 million   driven by lower volume on contracts supporting radar programs, and higher net sales   of $279 million   on classified programs  .   The remaining change in total net sales     was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.    
    
  The   decrease   in total net sales of   $299 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to lower intersegment sales of $163 million principally driven by lower volume on contracts supporting U.S. Army ground sensor systems, lower net sales of $144 million on classified programs, lower net sales of $101 million on certain intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems programs principally driven by reduced program requirements, and lower net sales of $68 million on integrated communications systems programs principally driven by lower U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force customer requirements on tactical communications systems. The decrease in total net sales was partially offset by higher net sales of $132 million on an electronic warfare systems contract driven by cost and schedule requirements. 
    
  Total Operating Expenses   The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $224 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a   decrease   in materials and subcontractors costs of   $183 million   and a decrease in other cost of sales and other operating

             Table of Contents  

   expenses of   $56 million  . The decrease in material and subcontractors costs was driven principally by activity on intersegment contracts supporting radar programs and activity on the international tactical radar programs described above in Total Net Sales, partially offset by activity on the classified programs described above in Total Net Sales. The remaining change in materials and subcontractors costs was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver. The decrease in other cost of sales and other operating expenses was primarily due to the timing and amount of adjustments for loss contracts, which had an impact of $31 million, and the timing of costs applied to contracts through rates, which had an impact of $29 million. 
    
  The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $225 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was due to decreases in labor costs of   $225 million   and materials and subcontractors costs of   $159 million  , partially offset by an increase in other cost of sales and other operating expenses of   $159 million  . The decrease in labor costs was principally driven by the activity on the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in materials and subcontractors costs was driven by the activity on the programs described above in Total Net Sales, with the remaining change spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver. The increase in other cost of sales and other operating expenses was primarily driven by a change in previously deferred precontract costs based on contract awards or funding, which had an impact of $42 million, higher general and administrative expenses of $35 million driven by   higher independent research and development activity related to electronic warfare technology  , and an $18 million legal reserve for a contractual dispute. 
    
  Operating Income and Margin   The   decrease   in operating income of   $52 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a net change in EAC adjustments of   $93 million   and decreased volume of   $33 million  , partially offset by a change in mix and other performance of   $74 million  . The net change in EAC adjustments was principally driven by labor and material production efficiencies throughout 2014 on two international tactical radar systems programs which amounted to $58 million, with the remainder of the change driven by efficiencies on certain classified programs in   2014  . The decrease in volume was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver. The change in mix and other performance was primarily driven by international F-15 Radar programs. Also included in mix and other performance were $35 million and $40 million for acquisition-related costs, primarily related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, in   2015   and   2014  , respectively, and an $11 million gain on a real estate transaction in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating margin in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the net change in EAC adjustments, partially offset by the change in mix and other performance. 
    
  The decrease in operating income of   $74 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was due to a change in mix and other performance of   $40 million   and a decrease in volume of   $33 million  . The decrease in mix and other performance was principally due to $7 million of income in 2014 from certain license royalties based on third-party usage compared to $34 million in 2013 and an $18 million legal reserve for a contractual dispute. Also included in mix and other performance in   2014   and   2013   was $40 million and $45 million, respectively, for acquisition-related costs primarily related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The decrease in volume was principally driven by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in operating margin in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily driven by the change in mix and other performance. 
    
  Backlog and Bookings   Backlog was   $6,309 million  ,   $6,930 million   and   $7,751 million   at   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The   decrease   in backlog of   $621 million   or   9%   at   December 31, 2015   compared to   December 31, 2014   was primarily due to sales in excess of bookings, principally within our Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Systems and Tactical Airborne Systems product lines. The   decrease   in backlog of   $821 million   at   December 31, 2014   compared to   December 31, 2013   was primarily due to a backlog adjustment of approximately $450 million for a contract that was terminated for convenience. 
    
  The bookings decrease of   $474 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was driven primarily by lower bookings in our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (ISRS) and Tactical Airborne Systems (TAS) product lines, partially offset by higher bookings in our Electronic Warfare Systems (EWS) product line. In   2015  , SAS booked $153 million on a multi-mission radar program for the U.S. Navy and an international customer, $106 million for the production of Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars for the U.S. Air Force, $102 million on the Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) program, $99 million on an AESA radar Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract for an international customer, $92 million to provide radar spares for an international customer, $92 million for the production of AESA radars for an international customer, $88 million to provide radar components for the U.S. Air Force, and $82 million to provide communication subsystems for the U.S. Navy and an international customer.

    General and administrative expenses     salaries, benefits and related expenses for our executive, finance and administrative personnel; third party professional service fees; and allocated costs.  
       
  Total operating expenses in   2015     increased     $205 million   compared to   2014  . The increase in all of the categories of total operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. In addition, the increase in total operating expenses included $20 million of additional research and development and selling and marketing expenses for the development and launch of new commercial products. Research and development expense in   2015   also included $6 million related to severance and retention associated with the restructuring of Websense. Total operating expenses excluded   $58 million   and   $6 million   of amortization of acquired intangible assets in   2015   and   2014  , respectively, as described below in Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments, and   $26 million   of other acquisition and acquisition related costs in   2015   as described below in Corporate.  
    
  The   increase   in total operating expenses of   $19 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to an   increase   in research and development expenses of   $11 million  , driven principally by the development of new commercial software products. Total operating expenses excluded   $6 million   and   $9 million   of amortization of acquired intangible assets in   2014   and   2013  , respectively, as described below in Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments. 
    
  Operating Income and Margin   The   increase   in operating income of   $19 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to an additional $30 million of income resulting from the acquisition of Websense, partially offset by the additional research and development and sales and marketing expenses for the development and launch of new commercial products. Operating income in   2015   and   2014   excludes   $119 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, related to the acquisition accounting adjustments described below in Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments and certain other acquisition and acquisition related costs described below in Corporate. The   decrease   in operating margin in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the research and development and sales and marketing expenses described above. 
    
  Operating income in   2014   was relatively consistent with   2013  . Operating income in   2014   and   2013   excludes   $6 million   and   $9 million  , respectively, related to the acquisition accounting adjustments described below in Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments.

   assets related to the Websense acquisition and historical RCP acquisitions. These adjustments are not considered part of management's evaluation of Forcepoint segment results. 
    
  The components of Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments were as follows: 

The change in our Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments of   $113 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was due to a   $61 million     increase   in the deferred revenue adjustment and a   $52 million     increase   in the intangibles amortization adjustment, both of which were driven by the acquisition of Websense. 
    
  The Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments in   2014   were relatively consistent with   2013  . 
    
    FAS/CAS Adjustment 
  The FAS/CAS Adjustment represents the difference between our pension and PRB expense or income under FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under CAS. The results of each segment only include pension and PRB expense under CAS that we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. 
    
  The components of the FAS/CAS Adjustment were as follows: 

The components of the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment were as follows:    

The key drivers of the difference between FAS and CAS expense (and consequently, the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment) are the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experience differs from our assumptions under each set of requirements and the calculation of funded status under CAS Harmonization. In accordance with both FAS and CAS, a  calculated market-related value  of our plan assets is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is determined using actual asset gains or losses over a certain prior period (three years for FAS and five years for CAS, subject to certain limitations under CAS on the difference between the market-related value and actual market value of assets). Generally, gains or losses are amortized under FAS over the average future working lifetime of the eligible employee population of approximately 10 years. Beginning in 2013, CAS Harmonization reduced this amortization period from 15 to 10 years, as well as changed the liability measurement method. Another driver of CAS expense (but not FAS expense) is the funded status of our pension plans under CAS. CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded; consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. 
    
  The change in our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment of   $99 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was driven by a   $291 million     increase   in our FAS expense and a   $192 million     increase   in our CAS expense. The   increase   in our FAS expense in   2015   was primarily due to the lower discount rate at December 31, 2014 compared to the discount rate as of December 31, 2013, and the change in our long-term ROA assumption from 8.75% to 8.0%. The   increase   in the CAS expense in   2015   was primarily due to the CAS Harmonization phased transition 25% increase from 2014 to 2015 to the use of a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, consistent with PPA, to measure liabilities in determining the CAS pension expense. The change in  

63 

           Table of Contents  

   the discount rate used to measure liabilities for purposes of determining CAS pension expenses has been included in our contracts through our overhead forward pricing rates. 
    
  The change in our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment of   $534 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was driven by a   $345 million     decrease   in FAS and a   $189 million     increase   in our CAS expense. The   decrease   in our FAS expense in   2014   was primarily due the higher discount rate at December 31, 2013 compared to the discount rate as of December 31, 2012, and the favorable 2013 asset performance. The   increase   in the CAS expense in   2014   was primarily due to the first year of the CAS Harmonization phased transition to the use of the discount rate described above. This was offset by a decrease in CAS as a result of the passage of the HATFA Act. The change in the discount rate used to measure liabilities for purposes of determining CAS pension expenses has been included in our contracts through our overhead forward pricing rates. 
    
  For   2016   compared to   2015  , we currently expect our FAS expense to decrease and our CAS expense to increase, resulting in a higher FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to income. We expect the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to be approximately   $400 million   of income driven by the differences in the assumptions and the recognition period for gains and losses under FAS and CAS and the transition to CAS Harmonization. This expected increase in the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment is subject to our annual update, generally planned in the third quarter, of our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for both FAS and CAS for final census data. After 2016, the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment is more difficult to predict because future FAS and CAS expense is based on a number of key assumptions for future periods. Differences between those assumptions and future actual results could significantly change both FAS and CAS expense in future periods. However, based solely on our current assumptions at December 31, 2015 and taking into account CAS Harmonization, which increases CAS expense in 2014 and beyond, we would expect our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to increase income in 2017. 
    
  The components of the FAS/CAS PRB Adjustment were as follows: 

Corporate 
  Corporate operating income consists of unallocated costs and certain other corporate costs not considered part of management s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance. 
    
  Operating income related to Corporate was as follows:    

The   decrease   in operating income related to Corporate of   $40 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to   $26 million   of Websense transaction and integration-related expenses in   2015  . Included in operating income related to Corporate in   2014   was   $25 million   of stock-based compensation expense associated with RSUs awarded in   2014  . The RSU awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (MDCC) and are compensatory in nature. The RSUs continue to vest, but do not accelerate, on the scheduled vesting dates into retirement subject to the employee's compliance with certain post-employment covenants. Due to the continued vesting provisions of the RSUs into retirement, the Company recognized all of the stock-based compensation expense associated with the RSUs in   2014   rather than over the vesting period of the awards. 
    
  The   decrease   in operating income related to Corporate of   $42 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   $25 million   of stock-based compensation expense associated with RSUs awarded in   2014  . 
    
    Discontinued Operations 
  In pursuing our business strategies we have divested certain non-core businesses, investments and assets when appropriate. All residual activity relating to our previously disposed businesses appears in discontinued operations. 

64 

           Table of Contents  

   In the second quarter of 2014, we received notice of the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standard 413 (CAS 413) for operations we divested over ten years ago. Under CAS 413, a pension plan termination adjustment is required when a contractor divests a business, yet retains ownership of the pension plan assets and liabilities of that business. These adjustments can result in payments to the U.S. government for pension plans that are in surplus position or payments to contractors for plans that are in a deficit position. As a result, in 2014 we received payment of   $81 million   and recorded a   $52 million   gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations, attributable to the affected plans that were in a deficit position at the time of divestiture.    
    
  In 2010, we recorded a     $39 million     charge, net of federal tax benefit, in discontinued operations related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessing Flight Options LLC (Flight Options) for excise taxes. We contested the matter through litigation, and in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement and recorded a   $33 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement regarding certain tax audits associated with our divestiture of Raytheon Aircraft Company and recorded a     $25 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations.    
    
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  Overview 
  We pursue a capital deployment strategy that balances funding for growing our business, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development; prudently managing our balance sheet, including debt repayments and pension contributions; and returning cash to our shareholders, including dividend payments and share repurchases  , as outlined below. Our need for, cost of and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as other external conditions. We currently expect that cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, cash flow from operations and other available financing resources will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure, investment, debt service and other financing requirements during the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. 
    
  In addition, the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31:    

Operating Activities    

The increase of   $175 million   in net cash provided by operating activities in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to a decrease in pension contributions as discussed below, partially offset by an increase in tax payments as discussed below, and the timing of collections, which is driven by various items including milestone payments on international programs and payment terms. The decrease of   $194 million   in net cash provided by operating activities in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to higher pension contributions and higher net tax payments described below, partially offset by discontinued operations cash activity primarily due to a resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under CAS 413 for operations we divested over ten years ago as discussed above in Segment Results beginning on page   48  . 
    
  Pension Plan Contributions     We may make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined in accordance with the Pension Protection Act (PPA), which amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) rules and are affected by the actual return on plan assets (ROA) and plan funded status. The funding requirements under the PPA require us to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of the year.   The PPA funded status is based on  

65 

           Table of Contents  

   actual asset performance, averaged over three years and PPA discount rates, which are based on a 24-month average of high quality corporate bond rates, as published by the IRS. As discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates beginning on page   32  , the STE Act, HATFA Act and BBA Act were passed by Congress and signed by the President in 2012, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The STE Act includes a provision for temporary pension funding relief due to the low interest rate environment. The provision adjusts the 24-month average high quality corporate bond rates used to determine the PPA funded status so that they are within a floor and cap, or  corridor , based on the 25-year average of corporate bond rates. The STE Act gradually phased out this interest rate provision beginning in 2013. The HATFA and BBA Acts extended the phase out provisions until 2020. As a result, the interest rates used to determine PPA funded status will continue to be adjusted within a  corridor  and do not begin to phase out until 2020. 
    
  We made the following required and discretionary contributions during the years ended December 31:     

The   decrease   in required pension contributions of   $311 million   in   2015   compared to   2014   and   $128 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to HATFA as described above.  
    
  We expect to make required contributions to our pension and PRB plans of approximately   $165 million   in   2016  . We periodically evaluate whether to make discretionary contributions. Due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies, our FAS pension expense or income is not indicative of the funding requirement or amount of government recovery. 
    
  Tax Payments and Refunds   We made the following net tax payments during the years ended December 31: 

The increase in net tax payments of $322 million in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the timing and amount of pension contributions. Federal and foreign net tax payments for   2016   are expected to approximate   $700 million  . The decrease in expected federal and foreign net tax payments in   2016   is primarily due to the timing and amount of pension contributions. 
    
  Interest Payments   We made interest payments on our outstanding debt of   $232 million  ,   $209 million   and   $210 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The   increase   in interest payments in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the issuance of $600 million of fixed-rate long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
    
  Investing Activities    

The change of   $422 million   in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to higher cash payments for acquisitions described below, partially offset by our short-term investments activity as described below. The change of   $849 million   in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to higher cash payments for acquisitions and the short-term investments activity, both described below.

           Table of Contents  

   Additions to Property Plant and Equipment and Capitalized Internal Use Software   Additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized internal use software were as follows:    

We expect our property, plant and equipment and capitalized internal use software expenditures to be between approximately   $415 $475 million   and   $60 $80 million  , respectively, in   2016  , consistent with the anticipated needs of our business and for specific investments including capital assets and facility improvements. 
    
  Short-term Investments Activity   We invest in marketable securities in accordance with our short-term investment policy and cash management strategy. These marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value as short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.   Activity related to short-term investments was as follows:    

As of   December 31, 2015  , our short-term investments had an average maturity of approximately five months.    
    
  Acquisitions   In pursuing our business strategies, we acquire and invest in certain businesses that meet strategic and financial criteria. Payments for purchases of acquired companies, net of cash acquired, were as follows: 

The increase of $1,527 million in payments for acquired companies, net of cash received,   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to the 2015 acquisitions of Websense for $1.9 billion and Foreground Security for $62 million. The increase of $418 million in payments for acquired companies, net of cash received, in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the 2014 acquisition of Blackbird Technologies, Incorporated for $427 million. 
    
  Financing Activities 

We have used cash provided by operating activities, and proceeds from the issuance of new debt as our primary source for the repayment of debt, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common stock. The change of   $573 million   in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in   2015   compared to   2014   was primarily due to proceeds from debt issuance in 2014 and an increase in share repurchases, partially offset by the sale of noncontrolling interest in Forcepoint, all of which are described below. The change of   $861 million   in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt and the decrease in stock repurchases described below.  
    
  Debt   In the fourth quarter of 2014, we received proceeds of   $592 million   for the issuance of   $600 million   fixed-rate long-term debt.  
    
  Share Repurchases     From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In September 2011, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to   $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock. Our Board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock in November 2013 and up to another additional   $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock in November 2015. At     December 31, 2015  , we had approximately     $2.5 billion     available under the 2015 and 2013 repurchase programs.     Share repurchases will take place from time to time at management s discretion depending on market conditions.    

67 

           Table of Contents  

   Share repurchases also include shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock  , RSUs,   stock options and   Long-term Performance Plan (LTPP)   awards issued to employees.    
    
  Our share repurchases were as follows:       

Cash Dividends   Our Board of Directors authorized the following cash dividends:     

In March   2015  , our Board of Directors authorized an   11%   increase to our annual dividend payout rate from   $2.42   to   $2.68   per share. In March   2014  , our Board of Directors authorized a   10%   increase in our annual dividend payout rate from   $2.20   to   $2.42   per share. Dividends are subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors.    
    
  Sale of Noncontrolling Interest in Forcepoint   In connection with the Websense acquisition, we combined Websense with RCP to form Forcepoint and then sold   19.7%   of the equity interest in Forcepoint to Vista Equity Partners for   $343 million  .   For more information on the Forcepoint joint venture, see Item 1 "Business," and "Note 5: Forcepoint Joint Venture" within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.    
    
    CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Total debt was   $5.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , and   December 31, 2014  . Our outstanding debt bears contractual interest at fixed interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 7.2% and matures at various dates from 2018 through 2044. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments   Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were   $3.2 billion   and   $4.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. We may invest in U.S. Treasuries; AAA/Aaa rated money market funds; certificates of deposit, time deposits and commercial paper of banks with a minimum long-term debt rating of A or A2 and minimum short-term debt rating of A-1 and P-1; and commercial paper of corporations with a minimum long-term debt rating of A- or A3 and minimum short-term debt rating of A-2 and P-2. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were approximately   $1,040 million   and   $715 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. In the first quarter of 2014, a foreign subsidiary authorized and completed a transaction which resulted in a taxable dividend of approximately   $115 million  . The transaction does not affect our indefinite reinvestment assertion because it generated a net tax benefit of approximately   $80 million  . Earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continuously evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors that affect our global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and capital market conditions. 
    
  Credit Facilities   In November 2015, we entered into a   $1.25 billion   revolving credit facility maturing in November 2020 and terminated the previous     $1.4 billion     credit facility entered into in December 2011. Under the     $1.25 billion     credit facility, we can borrow, issue letters of credit and backstop commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at various rate options, including LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit ratings. Based on our credit ratings at     December 31, 2015  , borrowings would generally bear interest at LIBOR plus 80.5 basis points. The credit facility is composed of commitments from   20   separate highly rated lenders, each committing no more than   10%   of the facility. As of   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014     there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We had no outstanding letters of credit at     December 31, 2015   and   $2 million     of outstanding letters of credit at   December 31, 2014  ,   which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility by that amount.

           Table of Contents  

   Under the     $1.4 billion   and   $1.25 billion     credit facilities we must comply with certain covenants, including a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than     60%  .  We were in compliance with the credit facility covenants during 2015 and 2014. Our ratio of total debt to total capitalization, as those terms are defined in the credit facility, was     34.5%   at   December 31, 2015  .   We are providing this ratio as this metric is used by our lenders to monitor our leverage and is also a threshold that limits our ability to utilize this facility.    
    
  Credit Ratings   Three major corporate debt rating organizations, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody s and Standard   Poor s (S P), assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. The following chart reflects the current ratings assigned by each of these agencies as of   December 31, 2015   to our short-term and long-term senior unsecured debt:    

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
  The following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding at   December 31, 2015  :    

(1) 
    Debt includes scheduled principal payments only. 
       
  Purchase obligations in the table above represent enforceable and legally binding agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services. We enter into contracts with customers, primarily the U.S. government, which entitle us to full recourse for costs incurred, including purchase obligations, in the event the contract is terminated by the customer for convenience. These purchase obligations are included above notwithstanding the amount for which we are entitled to full recourse from our customers. The table above does not include required pension and PRB contributions. We expect to make required pension and PRB contributions of approximately   $165 million   in   2016  , exclusive of any U.S. government recovery. Amounts beyond   2016   for required pension and PRB contributions depend upon actuarial assumptions, actual plan asset performance and other factors described under pension costs in Critical Accounting Estimates beginning on page   32  . However, based solely on our current assumptions, we expect our funding requirements to be approximately   $933 million   in 2017, exclusive of any U.S. government recovery. 
    
  Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at our option. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest, net of the federal benefit, was   $8 million   and   $108 million  , respectively, and was included in accrued retiree benefits and other long-term liabilities. These amounts were not included in the table above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain. 
     
    OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  At   December 31, 2015  , we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and guarantees to third parties on behalf of our affiliates as described below in Commitments and Contingencies. Such arrangements are not material to our overall liquidity or capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support as described below. 

69 

             Table of Contents  

   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Environmental Matters     We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of the liability of total environmental remediation costs includes the use of a discount rate and takes into account that a portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within contracts in process, net, in our consolidated balance sheets.    Our estimates regarding remediation costs to be incurred were as follows at December 31:     

We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of environmental matters. However, we do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred are:    

Financing Arrangements and Other     We issue guarantees, and banks and surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. These instruments expire on various dates through 2024. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding.   The stated values outstanding consisted of the following   at December 31:     

Included in guarantees and letters of credit described above were   $203 million   and   $187 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  , and   $196 million   and   $244 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  , related to our joint venture in Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. (TRS).   We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans and meet their project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation to us. We periodically evaluate the risk of TRS and other affiliates failing to meet their obligations described above.   At   December 31, 2015  ,   we believe the risk that TRS and other affiliates will not be able to meet their obligations is minimal for the foreseeable future based on their current financial condition. All obligations were current at     December 31, 2015  . At   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , we had an estimated liability of   $8 million   and   $9 million  , respectively, related to these guarantees and letters of credit.

   In 2001, we formed the TRS joint venture with Thales S.A. See additional background on the TRS joint venture in "Note 9: Other Assets, Net" within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. On December 24, 2015 Thales S.A. and Raytheon entered into a letter agreement relating to the joint venture agreement for the TRS joint venture (excluding Thales-Raytheon Systems Air and Missile Defense Command and Control S.A.S (TRS AMDC2), previously called Air Command Systems International S.A.S). The letter agreement contemplates that the parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to amend the joint venture agreement on or before June 30, 2016 to reduce its existing scope of work to NATO-only business opportunities involving air command and control systems. In connection with the contemplated changes, we will reacquire Thales S.A.'s noncontrolling interest in Thales-Raytheon Systems LLC (TRS LLC) and sell our equity method interest in TRS SAS, with a net payment due to Thales S.A. totaling   $90 million   based on the relative values and undistributed earnings of TRS LLC and TRS SAS. Any gain or loss resulting from the transactions contemplated by the letter agreement will be recognized upon completion of a definitive agreement and resolution of all contingencies which is expected to occur on or before June 30, 2016. The TRS joint venture will continue to operate under the current structure until the close of the transactions.    
    
  We have an approximately   $400 million     international classified contract that did not achieve certain contractual milestones in 2015. We are working with the customer to complete the milestones quickly and we currently do not expect to be terminated on the program. However, if we were terminated for default, it could result in a write-off currently estimated at     $180     $200 million  . 
    
  The joint venture agreement between Raytheon and Vista Equity Partners provides Vista Equity Partners with certain rights to require Forcepoint to pursue an initial public offering at any time after four years and three months following the closing date of May 29, 2015, or pursue a sale of the company at any time after five years following the closing date. In either of these events, Raytheon has the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of Vista Equity Partners  interest in Forcepoint for cash at a price equal to fair value as determined under the joint venture agreement. Additionally, Vista Equity Partners has the ability to liquidate its ownership through a put option any time after two years following the closing date. In the event of a put option, Vista Equity Partners could require Raytheon to purchase all (but not less than all) of Vista Equity Partners  interest in Forcepoint for cash at a price equal to fair value as determined under the joint venture agreement. Lastly, at any time after three years following the closing date, Raytheon has the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of Vista Equity Partners  interest in Forcepoint at a price equal to fair value as determined under the joint venture agreement.  
    
  We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries.   At   December 31, 2015  ,   the aggregate amount of our offset agreements had an outstanding notional value of approximately     $5.5 billion  . To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations that satisfy our offset agreements, those amounts are included in the Contractual Obligations table on page   69  .   These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities, or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have historically not been required to pay any such penalties. 
    
  As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to many levels of audit and investigation by the U.S. government relating to our contract performance and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA); the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA); the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other departments and agencies; the Government Accountability Office; the Department of Justice (DoJ); and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S.  

71 

             Table of Contents  

   government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DoJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S. and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited.     Other than as specifically disclosed herein, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. 
  We do not currently expect the economic downturn in Greece to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We have less than 1% of our sales in Greece and less than $100 million in U.S. dollar denominated contracts in process. We currently believe all of these amounts to be collectible; however, if circumstances change, we could be required to write off some or all of the contracts in process balance. 
    
  In addition, various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against, or initiated by, us. We do not expect any of these proceedings to result in any additional liability or gains that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   In connection with certain of our legal matters, we may be entitled to insurance recovery for qualified legal costs. We do not expect any insurance recovery to have a material impact on the financial exposure that could result from these matters. 
    
    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Our primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. 
    
  We generally supplement our working capital requirements with a combination of variable-rate short-term and fixed-rate long-term financing. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the foreign currency exchange rates on specific commitments and payments to vendors and customer receipts. We may enter into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks to manage interest rates associated with our financing arrangements. The market-risk sensitive instruments we use for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability or transaction for which a firm commitment is in place. 
    
  The following tables provide information as of   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations.   There were no interest rate swaps outstanding   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  .    
    
  Principal payments and interest rate detail for long-term debt by contractual maturity dates as of   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, were as follows:    

In addition, the aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was   $1,076 million   and   $926 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively.   The net notional exposure of these contracts was approximately     $117 million   and   $57 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. 
    
  For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualifying for hedge accounting, we record the effective portion of the  

72 

           Table of Contents  

   gain or loss on the derivative in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), net of tax, and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged revenue or cost of sales transaction affects earnings. Unrealized gains of   $9 million   and   $7 million   were included in non-current assets and unrealized losses of   $29 million   and   $24 million   were included in current liabilities at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively.  
    
  Realized gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. We believe our exposure due to changes in foreign currency rates is not material due to our hedging policy. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015  , we had short-term investments with a fair value of   $872 million  , which are classified as available-for-sale and consist of   highly rated bank certificates of deposit with a minimum long-term debt rating of A or A2 and a minimum short-term debt rating of A-1 and P-1  . Our exposure due to changes in interest rates is not material due to the nature and amount of our short-term investments (i.e., high-quality certificates of deposit which had an average maturity of approximately   five months  ).

COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  The financial statements and related information contained in this Annual Report have been prepared by and are the responsibility of our management.

   MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. The Company s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , based on criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework, issued by the COSO in 2013. The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included below.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Raytheon Company: 
    
  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2015   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
    
  As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the classification of deferred taxes in the consolidated balance sheets due to the adoption of ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Consolidation and Classification   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Raytheon Company, and all wholly-owned, majority-owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. As used in these notes, the terms  we ,  us ,  our ,  Raytheon  and the  Company  mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning. 
    
  Use of Estimates   Our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition     We use the percentage-of-completion accounting method to account for our long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, such as certain cost-plus service contracts. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion of the long-term contract.     Our analysis of these contracts also contemplates whether contracts should be combined or segmented in accordance with the applicable criteria under U.S. GAAP. We combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under U.S. GAAP are met. The combination of two or more contracts requires judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single project, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if the applicable criteria under U.S. GAAP are met. Judgment also is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segmented based on how the arrangement was negotiated and the performance criteria. The decision to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period.    
    
  The selection of a method to measure progress toward completion of a contract also requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our long-term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress toward completion of the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Contract costs include labor, materials and subcontractors costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion (the process for which we describe below in more detail) is complex and subject to many variables. Incentive and award fees generally are awarded at the discretion of the customer or upon achievement of certain program milestones or cost targets. Incentive and award fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance, which may include the performance of subcontractors or partners depending on the individual contract requirements. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event generally are not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated.    
    
  We have a companywide standard and disciplined quarterly Estimate at Completion (EAC)   process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress toward completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities include management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product) and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (e.g., to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and related support cost allocations), performance by our subcontractors, the availability and timing  

82 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

of funding from our customer, and overhead cost rates, among other variables. These estimates also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset obligations, required under certain contracts. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustments to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual contracts, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of those contracts or in realizing related opportunities. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks or in realizing related     opportunities. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized quarterly on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts.     When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. 
    
  Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: 

We apply the separation guidance under U.S. GAAP for contracts with multiple deliverables. We analyze revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine if the deliverables should be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices, which we determine based on prices of the deliverables as sold on a stand-alone basis, or if not sold on a stand-alone basis, the prices we would charge if sold on a stand-alone basis. We recognize revenue for each deliverable based on the revenue recognition policies described herein. 
    
  We recognize revenue on contracts to sell software when evidence of an arrangement exists, the software has been delivered and accepted by the customer, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. For software arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and undelivered items (e.g., maintenance and/or services; subscriptions/term licenses), we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize revenue on the perpetual license using the residual method. We base VSOE of each element on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the applicable performance period. We also sell software via subscriptions and hosted solutions and revenue for these arrangements is recognized straight-line over the term of the agreement. A portion of our revenues are generated from the sale of appliances that contain software components, such as operating systems, that operate together with the hardware platform to provide the essential functionality of the appliance. When sold in a multiple element arrangement, these appliances are considered non-software deliverables and therefore, we can allocate the arrangement fee based upon relative selling price of each element. When applying the relative selling price method, we determine the selling price of each element using best estimate of selling price (BESP), because VSOE and third-party evidence (TPE) are not available. The revenues allocated to the software-related elements are recognized based on software industry specific revenue recognition guidance, as noted above. The revenues allocated to the non-software related elements are recognized based on the nature of the element provided. We estimate BESP by considering internal factors such as historical pricing practices and gross margin objectives, as well as market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies, customer demands and geography, and regularly review these assumptions.  
  To a much lesser extent, we enter into other types of contracts such as service, commercial, and licensing arrangements. Revenue under fixed-price service contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment, and under commercial contracts, generally is recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our price is fixed or determinable, and collectability  

83 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

is reasonably assured. Costs on fixed-price service contracts are expensed as incurred, unless they otherwise qualify for deferral. Revenue from non-software license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Additionally, royalty revenue is recognized when earned.  
    
  Research and Development Expenses   Research and development expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred, and were   $706 million  ,   $500 million   and   $465 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts are accounted for as contract costs as the work is performed and included in contracts in process, net, in our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Federal, Foreign and State Income Taxes   The Company and its domestic subsidiaries provide for federal income taxes on pretax accounting income at rates in effect under existing tax law. Foreign subsidiaries record provisions for income taxes at applicable foreign tax rates in a similar manner. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. The Company does not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations or expected to be remitted substantially free of additional tax. With the exception of Forcepoint, payments made for state income taxes are included in administrative and selling expenses as these costs can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government in the period in which the tax is payable. Accordingly, the state income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to contracts in future periods as described below in Deferred Contract Costs. Payments made for state income taxes related to Forcepoint are included in federal and foreign income tax expense. 
    
  Other Expense (Income), Net   Other expense (income), net, consists primarily of gains and losses from our investments held in trusts used to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, gains and losses on the early repurchase of long-term debt and certain financing fees. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of   90 days   or less at the date of purchase. The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities.  
    
  Short-term Investments     We invest in marketable securities in accordance with our short-term investment policy and cash management strategy. These marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value as short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.   These investments are deemed Level 2 assets under the fair value hierarchy at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , as their fair value is determined under a market approach using valuation models that utilize observable inputs, including maturity date, issue date, settlements date, and current rates. At   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , we had short-term investments of   $872 million   and   $1,497 million  , respectively, consisting of   highly rated bank certificates of deposit with a minimum long-term debt rating of A or A2 and a minimum short-term debt rating of A-1 and P-1  .   As of   December 31, 2015  , our short-term investments had an average maturity of approximately five months.   The amortized cost of these securities closely approximated their fair value at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . There were no securities deemed to have other than temporary declines in value for   2015  . In   2015  , we recorded unrealized gains on short-term investments of less than   $1 million  , net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL). In   2014  , we recorded unrealized losses on short-term investments of less than   $1 million  , net of tax, in AOCL. In   2015  , we recorded sales of short-term investments of   $209 million  , which resulted in gains of less than   $1 million   recorded in other (income) expense, net. In   2014  , we recorded sales of short-term investments of   $882 million  , which resulted in gains of less than   $1 million   recorded in other (income) expense, net. For purposes of computing realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, we determine cost on a specific identification basis.  
    
  Contracts in Process, Net   Contracts in process, net, are stated at cost plus estimated profit, but not in excess of estimated realizable value. Included in contracts in process are accounts receivable, which include amounts billed and due from customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and collateral to the extent applicable. 
    
  Deferred Contract Costs   Included in contracts in process, net, are certain costs related to the performance of our U.S. government contracts which are required to be recorded under U.S. GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such  

84 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income taxes, workers  compensation and certain other accruals. At   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , net deferred contract costs were approximately   $241 million   and   $223 million  , respectively. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. 
    
  Pension and other postretirement benefits (PRB) costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based on the U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The CAS requirements for pension and PRB costs differ from the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP. Given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS income or expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity, and therefore did not defer any FAS expense for pension and PRB plans in   2013     2015  . This resulted in   $185 million   of   income  ,   $286 million   of   income   and   $249 million   of   expense   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively, reflected in our consolidated results of operations for the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension and PRB plans in those years. 
    
  Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of its cost (first-in, first-out or average cost) or net realizable value. An impairment for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, future sales expectations and salvage value. 
    
  Inventories consisted of the following at December 31:    

We capitalize costs incurred in advance of contract award or funding in inventories if we determine that contract award or funding is probable. To the extent these are precontract costs, start-up costs have been excluded. We included capitalized precontract costs and other deferred costs of approximately   $225 million   and   $126 million   in inventories as work in process at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment, Net   Property, plant and equipment, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed. We include gains and losses on the sales of plant and equipment that are allocable to our contracts in overhead as we generally can recover these costs through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. For all other sales or asset retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating income. 
    
  Provisions for depreciation generally are computed using a combination of accelerated and straight-line methods and are based on estimated useful lives as follows:    

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. 
    
  Impairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets   We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter utilizing a two-step methodology that requires us to first identify potential goodwill  

85 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

impairment and then measure the amount of the related goodwill impairment loss, if any. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units under the impairment test assessment criteria outlined in U.S. GAAP. In performing our annual impairment test in the fourth quarters of   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   we did not identify any goodwill impairment. 
    
  We determine whether long-lived assets are to be held for use or disposal. Upon indication of possible impairment of long-lived assets held for use, we evaluate the recoverability of such assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. 
    
  Computer Software, Net   Internal use computer software, net, included in other assets, net, which consists primarily of our enterprisewide software solutions, is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, generally   10 years  . Computer software development costs related to software products developed for external use are capitalized, when significant, after establishment of technological feasibility and marketability. There have been no such costs capitalized to date as the costs incurred during the period between technological feasibility to general release have not been significant. 
    
  Advance Payments and Billings in Excess of Costs Incurred   We receive advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from customers that may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. We classify advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred as current liabilities. Costs incurred in excess of billings are classified as contracts in process, net.  
    
  Deferred Revenue   We receive up-front payments related to software license sales for Forcepoint, which we recognize ratably over the license term. We classify deferred revenue as current and noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. The current and noncurrent portions of Forcepoint's deferred revenue are included in other accrued expenses and accrued retiree benefits and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest   Redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized at the greater of the estimated redemption value as of the balance sheet date or the initial value adjusted for the noncontrolling interest holder's share of the cumulative impact of net income (loss) and other changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Adjustments to the redemption value over the period from the date of acquisition to the date the redemption feature becomes puttable are immediately recorded to retained earnings. We reflect the redemption value adjustments in the EPS calculation if redemption value is in excess of the fair value of noncontrolling interest. 
    
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign exchange translation adjustments, effective portion of gains and losses on derivative instruments qualified as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments, and gains and losses associated with pension and PRB. The computation of other comprehensive income (loss) and its components are presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  

86 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

Other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following activity during the years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  :  

Material amounts reclassified out of AOCL were related to amortization of net actuarial loss associated with our pension and PRB plans and were   $1,129 million  ,   $892 million   and   $1,154 million   before tax in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. This component of AOCL is included in the calculation of net periodic pension expense (income) (see "Note 14: Pension and Other Employee Benefits" for additional details). 
    
  The defined benefit pension and other employee benefit plans are shown net of tax benefits of   $3,824 million   and   $4,005 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. The cash flow hedges and interest rate locks are shown net of tax benefits of   $10 million   and   $8 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. The unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other are shown net of tax benefits of   $4 million   and   $2 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. We expect approximately   $5 million   of after-tax net unrealized losses on our cash flow hedges at   December 31, 2015   to be reclassified into earnings at then-current values over the next twelve months as the underlying hedged transactions occur. 
    
  Translation of Foreign Currencies   Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates and the effects of these translation adjustments are reported as a component of AOCL in equity. Deferred taxes are not recognized for translation-related temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries as their undistributed earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Income and expenses in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013   were not material. 
    
  Treasury Stock   Repurchased shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. We account for treasury stock under the cost method. Upon retirement the excess over par value is charged against additional paid-in capital. 
    
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (PRB) Costs   We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. We calculate our pension costs as required under U.S. GAAP, and the calculations and assumptions utilized require judgment. U.S. GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes. For purposes of determining pension expense under U.S. GAAP, a calculated  market-related value  of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is determined using actual asset gains or losses over a   three   year period. Under U.S. GAAP,   a  corridor  approach may be elected and applied in the recognition of asset and liability gains or losses which limits expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the projected benefit  

87 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

obligation or the calculated "market-related value" of assets. We do not use a  corridor  approach in the calculation of FAS expense. 
    
  We recognize the funded status of a postretirement benefit plan (defined benefit pension and other benefits) as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets. Funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the market value of the plan s assets. Previously unrecognized deferred amounts such as demographic or asset gains or losses and the impact of historical plan changes are included in AOCL. Changes in these amounts in future years will be reflected through AOCL and amortized in future pension expense over the estimated average remaining employee service period. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments   We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the foreign currency exchange rates on specific commitments, payments, and receipts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are transaction driven and relate directly to a particular asset, liability or transaction for which commitments are in place. We execute these instruments with financial institutions that we judge to be credit-worthy, and the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  
    
  For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, we record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in AOCL, net of tax, and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged revenue or cost of sales transaction affects earnings. We classify the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. The aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was   $1,076 million   and   $926 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively.   The net notional exposure of these contracts was approximately     $117 million   and   $57 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. The foreign currency forward contracts at   December 31, 2015   have maturities at various dates through 2028 as follows:   $695 million   in   2016  ;   $263 million   in   2017  ;   $70 million   in   2018  ; and   $48 million   thereafter. 
    
  We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of asset derivatives included in other assets, net and liability derivatives included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets related to foreign currency contracts were   $9 million   and   $29 million  , respectively at   December 31, 2015   and   $7 million   and   $24 million  , respectively at December 31, 2014. The fair values of these derivatives are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy for   2015   and   2014   because they are determined based on a market approach utilizing externally quoted forward rates for similar contracts. We measure and record the impact of counterparty credit risk into our valuation and the impact was less than   $1 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  . We designate most foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies, and interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate financing obligations. 
    
  Realized gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged. Gains and losses on derivatives not designated for hedge accounting or representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized currently in net sales or cost of sales. 
    
  We may also enter into pay-variable, receive-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate financing obligations. We account for our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of our fixed-rate financing obligations, and accordingly record gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these swaps in interest expense, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the fair value adjustment of the hedged portion of our fixed-rate financing obligations. We also record in interest expense the net amount paid or received under the swap for the period and the amortization of gain or loss from the early termination of interest rate swaps.   There were no interest rate swaps outstanding   for the years ended   December 31, 2015     and   2014  . 
    
  Fair Values   The accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy, which  

88 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required: 
    
           Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
       
           Level 2: 
    Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or that we corroborate with observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.  
       
           Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
       
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of marketable securities held in trust, short-term investments and foreign currency forward contracts as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  . Fair value information for those assets and liabilities, including their classification in the fair value hierarchy, is included in "Note 14: Pension and Other Employee Benefits" (for marketable securities held in trust) and "Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" (for short-term investments and foreign currency forward contracts). Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. We did not have any significant nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that would be recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015   and   2014  . We did not have any material amounts of Level 3 assets or liabilities at   December 31, 2015   and   2014  . 
    
  Earnings per Share (EPS)   We compute basic EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders by dividing income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, and net income attributable to Raytheon Company, by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, including participating securities outstanding, as described below, during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution beyond shares for basic EPS that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, converted into common stock, or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would have shared in our earnings. We compute basic and diluted EPS using actual income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, net income attributable to Raytheon Company, and our actual weighted-average shares and participating securities outstanding rather than the numbers presented within our consolidated financial statements, which are rounded to the nearest million. As a result, it may not be possible to recalculate EPS as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, it may not be possible to recalculate EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders by adjusting EPS from continuing operations by EPS from discontinued operations. 
    
  We include all unvested stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, in the number of shares outstanding in our basic and diluted EPS calculations. As a result, we have included all of our outstanding unvested restricted stock and Long-term Performance Plan (LTPP) awards that meet the retirement eligible criteria in our calculation of basic and diluted EPS. We disclose EPS for common stock and unvested stock-based payment awards, and separately disclose distributed and undistributed earnings. Distributed earnings represent common stock dividends and dividends earned on unvested stock-based payment awards of retirement eligible employees. Undistributed earnings represent earnings that were available for distribution but were not distributed. Common stock and unvested stock-based payment awards earn dividends equally. 
    
  Employee Stock Plans   Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. The expense is recognized over the employees  requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The expense is amortized over the service period using the graded vesting method for our restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs) and the straight-line amortization method for our LTPP. The expense related to our Forcepoint long-term incentive plans is recognized over the requisite service period when achievement of the performance conditions is considered probable. The related gross excess tax benefit received upon exercise of stock options or vesting of a stock-based award, if any, is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity rather than an operating activity. 
    
  Risks and Uncertainties   We provide a wide range of technologically advanced products, services and solutions for principally governmental customers in the U.S. and abroad, and are subject to certain business risks specific to that industry.

Total sales to the U.S. government, excluding foreign military sales, were   68%  ,   70%  , and   72%   of total net sales in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Total sales to customers outside the U.S., including foreign military sales through the U.S. government, were   31%  ,   29%   and   27%   of total net sales in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing concepts of national defense, political developments abroad and other factors. Sales to international customers may be affected by changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by changes in threat environments, geo-political uncertainties, potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions, various regional and local economic and political factors, risks and uncertainties and U.S. foreign policy.  
    
  Accounting Standards    In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We have elected to early adopt this requirement retrospectively in the current period. We reclassified $165 million of net current deferred income tax liabilities from current to noncurrent at December 31, 2014.     
    
   In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent),   which, for all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, removes the requirement to make certain disclosures and to categorize them within the fair value hierarchy. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We have elected to early adopt this requirement retrospectively in the current period.     
    
   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We have elected to early adopt this requirement retrospectively in the current period. We reclassified $5 million of debt issuance costs from other assets, net, to a reduction of long-term debt at December 31, 2014.     
    
   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606) which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new standard, we expect to continue using the cost-to-cost percentage of completion method to recognize revenue for most of our long-term contracts. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential changes from this ASU to our future financial reporting and disclosures. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the new standard's effective date by one year. The new standard now would be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB will permit companies to adopt the new standard early, but not before the original effective date of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016   .  
    
  Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after     December 31, 2015     are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to   200 million   shares of preferred stock,   $0.01   par value per share, in multiple series with terms as determined by them. There were   no   shares of preferred stock outstanding at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  .    
    
    Note 3: eBorders Settlement 
  In March 2015, Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL) reached a settlement with the UK Home Office concluding the parties' dispute regarding the UK Home Office's July 2010 termination of RSL's eBorders contract within our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) segment. The settlement included a cash payment from the UK Home Office to RSL of    150 million   (approximately   $226 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of the settlement date) for the resolution of all claims and counterclaims of both parties related to the matter. After certain expenses and derecognition of the outstanding receivables, IIS recorded   $181 million   in operating income through a reduction in cost of sales in 2015. 
    
    Note 4: Acquisitions and Goodwill 
  In pursuing our business strategies, we acquire and make investments in certain businesses that meet strategic and financial criteria.  
    
  In October 2015, we acquired Foreground Security, subsequently renamed Raytheon Foreground Security (RFS), for   $62 million     in cash, net of cash received, and exclusive of retention payments. RFS will be integrated into our IIS business, within

the Cybersecurity and Special Missions (CSM) product area. RFS provides security operations centers (SOCs), managed security service solutions and cybersecurity professional services. RFS will accelerate Raytheon's expansion into managed security services across federal, international and commercial markets. In connection with this transaction we have preliminarily recorded     $50 million     of goodwill related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and     $7 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and technology with a weighted-average life of seven years. We expect to complete the purchase price allocation process in 2016 after our final reviews are completed.    
    
  In May 2015, we acquired Websense, Inc. (Websense) from Vista Equity Partners for approximately     $1.9 billion  , net of cash received, and exclusive of retention payments. Websense is a leader in advanced threat protection and data theft prevention across web, email, cloud and endpoint infrastructure. Following the acquisition, we completed a series of transactions to create our Forcepoint joint venture (with Vista Equity Partners).   For more information on the Forcepoint joint venture, see Item 1 "Business," and "Note 5: Forcepoint Joint Venture" within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   In connection with this acquisition, we incurred transaction and integration-related costs of   $33 million     in     2015   of which   $26 million   were recorded at Corporate. We recorded   $1.6 billion   of goodwill, all of which was allocated to the Forcepoint segment, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
    
  The final purchase price allocation, net of cash received, for the Websense acquisition was as follows:

In June 2013, we acquired Visual Analytics, Incorporated, subsequently renamed Raytheon Visual Analytics Incorporated (RVAI).   RVAI further extends our capabilities to meet the data analytics, data visualization and information sharing needs of our customers. In connection with this acquisition, we have recorded     $12 million     of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and     $3 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to technology and customer relationships with a weighted-average life of seven years.    
    
  Pro forma financial information and revenue from the date of acquisition has not been provided for these acquisitions as they are not material either individually or in the aggregate. 
    
  We funded each of the above acquisitions using cash on hand. The operating results of these businesses have been included in our consolidated results as of the respective closing dates of the acquisitions. The purchase price of these businesses has been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. 
    
  The total amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes related to these acquisitions was   $312 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  A rollforward of goodwill by segment was as follows:    

(1) 
    In connection with the reclassification of Raytheon Cyber Products (RCP) from our IIS segment, goodwill of   $185 million   was allocated to the Forcepoint segment on a relative fair value basis. 
              (2) 
    In addition to the acquisitions of Websense and Foreground Security, we acquired Sensintel, Inc. at Missile Systems (MS) and finalized the purchase price allocation for RBT at IIS in   2015  . 
       
  For information on our intangible assets, see "Note 9: Other Assets, Net". 
    
    Note 5: Forcepoint Joint Venture 
  In May 2015, we created Raytheon|Websense, a new cybersecurity joint venture company (with Vista Equity Partners), through a series of transactions by which we acquired Websense, Inc. (Websense) from Vista Equity Partners and combined it with RCP, formerly part of our IIS segment. We then sold   19.7%   of the equity interest in the combined company to Vista Equity Partners for   $343 million  . Raytheon|Websense was later renamed Forcepoint. 
    
  The joint venture agreement between Raytheon and Vista Equity Partners provides Vista Equity Partners with certain rights to require Forcepoint to pursue an initial public offering at any time after four years and three months following the closing date of May 29, 2015, or pursue a sale of the company at any time after five years following the closing date. In either of these events, Raytheon has the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of Vista Equity Partners  interest in Forcepoint for cash at a price equal to fair value as determined under the joint venture agreement. Additionally, Vista Equity Partners has the ability to liquidate its ownership through a put option any time after two years following the closing date. In the event of a put option, Vista Equity Partners could require Raytheon to purchase all (but not less than all) of Vista Equity Partners  interest in Forcepoint for cash at a price equal to fair value as determined under the joint venture agreement. Lastly, at any time after three years following the closing date, Raytheon has the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of Vista Equity Partners  interest in Forcepoint at a price equal to fair value as determined under the joint venture agreement. Vista Equity Partners'

    Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, was a loss of less than   $1 million   in   2015  . 
       
    Note 6: Discontinued Operations 
  In pursuing our business strategies we have divested certain non-core businesses, investments and assets when appropriate. All residual activity relating to our previously disposed businesses appears in discontinued operations.  
    
  In the second quarter of 2014, we received notice of the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standard 413 (CAS 413) for operations we divested over ten years ago. Under CAS 413, a pension plan termination adjustment is required when a contractor divests a business, yet retains ownership of the pension plan assets and liabilities of that business. These adjustments can result in payments to the U.S. government for pension plans that are in surplus position or payments to contractors for plans that are in a deficit position. As a result, in 2014 we received payment of   $81 million   and recorded a   $52 million   gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations, attributable to the affected plans that were in a deficit position at the time of divestiture.    
    
  In 2010, we recorded a     $39 million     charge, net of federal tax benefit, in discontinued operations related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessing Flight Options LLC (Flight Options) for excise taxes. We contested the matter through litigation, and in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement and recorded a   $33 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement regarding certain tax audits associated with our divestiture of Raytheon Aircraft Company and recorded a     $25 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations.    
    
    Note 7: Contracts in Process, Net 
  Contracts in process, net, consisted of the following at December 31:

The U.S. government has title to the assets related to unbilled amounts on contracts that provide progress payments. Unbilled amounts are recorded under the percentage-of-completion method and are recoverable from the customer upon shipment of the product, presentation of billings or completion of the contract. Included in unbilled at   December 31, 2015   was   $250 million   which is expected to be collected outside of one year. 
    
  Billed and unbilled contracts in process include retentions arising from contractual provisions. At   December 31, 2015  , retentions were   $50 million  . We anticipate collecting   $9 million   of these retentions in   2016   and the balance thereafter. 
    
    Note 8: Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 
  Property, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following at December 31: 

Depreciation and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment, net, was   $307 million  ,   $301 million   and   $303 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
    
    Note 9: Other Assets, Net 
  Other assets, net, consisted of the following at December 31: 

Computer software amortization expense was   $70 million  ,   $79 million   and   $82 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  
    
  Other intangible assets, net, consisted primarily of completed technology, intellectual property and acquired customer relationships, and increased   $509 million  ,   $126 million   and   $3 million   as a result of acquired businesses in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from   1   to   15   years using either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefits we expect to realize from such assets. Amortization expense for other intangible assets was   $113 million  ,   $58 million   and   $60 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
    
  Computer software and other intangible asset amortization expense is expected to be approximately   $199 million   in   2016  ,   $187 million   in   2017  ,   $166 million   in   2018  ,   $137 million   in   2019   and   $102 million   in   2020  .

Investments, which are included in other noncurrent assets, net, above consisted of the following at December 31:    

In 2001, we formed the TRS joint venture with Thales S.A. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars, and communication networks. We record our share of the TRS income or loss and other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of cost of sales and AOCL, respectively. We record losses beyond the carrying amount of the investment only when we guarantee obligations of the investee or commit to provide the investee further financial support. 
    
  TRS has three operating subsidiaries, one of which, Thales-Raytheon Systems LLC (TRS LLC), we control and consolidate, and the other two, Thales-Raytheon Systems Company S.A.S. (TRS SAS) and Thales-Raytheon Systems Air and Missile Defense Command and Control S.A.S. (TRS AMDC2), previously called Air Command Systems International S.A.S., which we account for using the equity method through our investment in TRS, all of which are reflected in our Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) segment. Of the   $99 million   investment in TRS,   $89 million   represents undistributed earnings at   December 31, 2015  . Our consolidated statements of operations includes net income, which represents net income attributable to Raytheon Company and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Our primary noncontrolling interest relates to TRS LLC. At   December 31, 2015  , TRS LLC had   $16 million   of receivables due from TRS AMDC2. 
    
  In addition, we have entered into certain joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of a customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby we receive a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint venture s capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, we record the work we perform for the joint venture as an operating activity. 
    
  Periodically we enter into other equity method investments that are not related to our core operations. We record the income or loss from these investments as a component of other (income) expense, net. We record losses beyond the carrying amount of the investment only when we guarantee obligations of the investee or commit to provide the investee further financial support. 
    
    Note 10: Long-term Debt 
  Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:    

(1) 
    Total long-term debt amounts at   December 31, 2014   are adjusted to reflect the reclassification of debt issuance costs of   $5 million   in accordance with ASU 2015-03. See "Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for additional information.

The notes are redeemable by us at any time at redemption prices based on U.S. Treasury rates. The carrying value of long-term debt was recorded at amortized cost. The fair value of long-term debt was determined using quoted prices in inactive markets, which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The estimated fair value of long-term debt was the following at December 31: 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we received proceeds of   $592 million   for the issuance of   $600 million   fixed-rate long-term debt. 
  The adjustments to the principal amounts of long-term debt were as follows at December 31:    

The aggregate amounts of principal payments due on long-term debt for the next five years are: 

In November 2015, we entered into a   $1.25 billion   revolving credit facility maturing in November 2020 and terminated the previous     $1.4 billion     credit facility entered into in December 2011. Under the     $1.25 billion     credit facility, we can borrow, issue letters of credit and backstop commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at various rate options, including LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit ratings. Based on our credit ratings at     December 31, 2015  , borrowings would generally bear interest at LIBOR plus 80.5 basis points. The credit facility is composed of commitments from   20   separate highly rated lenders, each committing no more than   10%   of the facility. As of   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014     there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We had no outstanding letters of credit at     December 31, 2015   and   $2 million     of outstanding letters of credit at   December 31, 2014  ,   which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility by that amount.  
    
  Under the     $1.4 billion   and   $1.25 billion     credit facilities we must comply with certain covenants, including a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than     60%  .   We were in compliance with the credit facility covenants during 2015 and 2014. Our ratio of total debt to total capitalization, as those terms are defined in the credit facility, was     34.5%   at   December 31, 2015  .   We are providing this ratio as this metric is used by our lenders to monitor our leverage and is also a threshold that limits our ability to utilize this facility.    
    
  Total cash paid for interest on long-term debt was   $232 million  ,   $209 million   and   $210 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies 
  Leases   At   December 31, 2015  , we had commitments under long-term leases requiring annual rentals on a net lease basis as follows:    

Rent expense was   $236 million  ,   $225 million   and   $248 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. In the normal course of business, we lease equipment, office buildings and other facilities under leases that include standard escalation clauses for adjusting rent payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015  , we had commitments under agreements to outsource a portion of our information technology function, which have minimum annual payments of approximately   $15 million  . 
    
  Environmental Matters     We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of the liability of total environmental remediation costs includes the use of a discount rate and takes into account that a portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within contracts in process, net, in our consolidated balance sheets.    Our estimates regarding remediation costs to be incurred were as follows at December 31:        

We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our consolidated financial statements.    
    
  Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of environmental matters. However, we do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.    
    
  Environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred are:

Financing Arrangements and Other     We issue guarantees, and banks and surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. These instruments expire on various dates through 2024. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding.   The stated values outstanding consisted of the following   at December 31:    

Included in guarantees and letters of credit described above were   $203 million   and   $187 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  , and   $196 million   and   $244 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  , related to our joint venture in TRS.   We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans and meet their project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation to us. We periodically evaluate the risk of TRS and other affiliates failing to meet their obligations described above.   At   December 31, 2015  ,   we believe the risk that TRS and other affiliates will not be able to meet their obligations is minimal for the foreseeable future based on their current financial condition. All obligations were current at     December 31, 2015  . At   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , we had an estimated liability of   $8 million   and   $9 million  , respectively, related to these guarantees and letters of credit. 
    
  In 2001, we formed the TRS joint venture with Thales S.A. See additional background on the TRS joint venture in "Note 9: Other Assets, Net" within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. On December 24, 2015 Thales S.A. and Raytheon entered into a letter agreement relating to the joint venture agreement for the TRS joint venture (excluding Thales-Raytheon Systems Air and Missile Defense Command and Control S.A.S (TRS AMDC2), previously called Air Command Systems International S.A.S). The letter agreement contemplates that the parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to amend the joint venture agreement on or before June 30, 2016 to reduce its existing scope of work to NATO-only business opportunities involving air command and control systems. In connection with the contemplated changes, we will reacquire Thales S.A.'s noncontrolling interest in Thales-Raytheon Systems LLC (TRS LLC) and sell our equity method interest in TRS SAS, with a net payment due to Thales S.A. totaling   $90 million   based on the relative values and undistributed earnings of TRS LLC and TRS SAS. Any gain or loss resulting from the transactions contemplated by the letter agreement will be recognized upon completion of a definitive agreement and resolution of all contingencies which is expected to occur on or before June 30, 2016. The TRS joint venture will continue to operate under the current structure until the close of the transactions.    
    
  We have an approximately   $400 million     international classified contract that did not achieve certain contractual milestones in 2015. We are working with the customer to complete the milestones quickly and we currently do not expect to be terminated on the program. However, if we were terminated for default, it could result in a write-off currently estimated at     $180     $200 million  . 
    
  As discussed in "Note 5: Forcepoint Joint Venture", under the joint venture agreement between Raytheon Company and Vista Equity Partners, Raytheon may be required to purchase Vista Equity Partners' interest in Forcepoint. 
    
  We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries.   At   December 31, 2015  ,   the aggregate amount of our offset agreements had an outstanding notional value of approximately     $5.5 billion  .   These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities, or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations

             Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have historically not been required to pay any such penalties.    
    
  As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to many levels of audit and investigation by the U.S. government relating to our contract performance and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA); the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA); the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other departments and agencies; the Government Accountability Office; the Department of Justice (DoJ); and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DoJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S. and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited.     Other than as specifically disclosed herein, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate.    
    
  In addition, various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against, or initiated by, us. We do not expect any of these proceedings to result in any additional liability or gains that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   In connection with certain of our legal matters, we may be entitled to insurance recovery for qualified legal costs. We do not expect any insurance recovery to have a material impact on the financial exposure that could result from these matters.    
  Product Warranty   We provide for product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales for which we recognize revenue upon delivery. 
    
  Activity related to product warranty accruals was as follows:    

We account for warranty provision costs incurred under our long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of progress as contracts costs, as the estimation of these costs is integral in determining the price of the related long-term contracts. The table above excludes these costs.

Note 12: Stockholders  Equity 
  The changes in shares of our common stock outstanding were as follows:    

From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In September 2011, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to   $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock. Our Board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional     $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock in November 2013 and up to another additional   $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock in November 2015. At     December 31, 2015  , we had approximately     $2.5 billion     available under the 2015 and 2013 repurchase programs.     Share repurchases will take place from time to time at management s discretion depending on market conditions.    
    
  Share repurchases also include shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock  , RSUs,   stock options and   LTPP   awards issued to employees.    
    
  Our share repurchases were as follows:    

In March 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an   11%   increase to our annual dividend payout rate from   $2.42   to   $2.68   per share. Our Board of Directors declared dividends of   $2.68  ,   $2.42   and   $2.20   per share in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Dividends are subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors. 
      
  Note 13: Stock-based Compensation Plans 
  The Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan provides for shares to be issued as stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs or stock grants, including awards based on performance criteria. The plan authorizes the issuance of   7.5 million   shares in addition to shares available under certain prior plans of the Company. The total maximum number of shares originally authorized for issuance under the 2010 Stock Plan and those certain prior plans is   41.8 million  . The 2010 Stock Plan provides that awards to our employees, officers and consultants are generally made by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (MDCC) and are compensatory in nature, while awards to our non-employee directors are made by the Board's Governance and Nominating Committee. Shares issued as a result of stock awards, stock option exercises or conversion of restricted stock unit awards will be funded through the issuance of shares under the 2010 Stock Plan. At   December 31, 2015   there were   7.0 million   shares available for new awards and   4.7 million   shares outstanding.

Stock-based compensation expense and the associated tax benefit recognized were as follows: 

At   December 31, 2015  , there was   $156 million   of compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.5 years  . 
    
  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) 
  Restricted stock awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the MDCC, generally   four years   for employee awards and   one year   for nonemployee directors. Restricted stock awards entitle the recipient to full dividend and voting rights beginning on the date of grant. Non-vested shares are restricted as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances. At the date of grant each share of restricted stock is credited to common stock at par value. The fair value of restricted stock, calculated under the intrinsic value method at the date of grant, is charged to income as compensation expense generally over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital. 
    
  RSUs also vest over a specified period of time as determined by the MDCC, are compensatory in nature and are primarily awarded to retirement eligible employees. Retirement eligible recipients of RSUs are entitled to full dividend rights beginning on the date of grant. In addition, RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees continue to vest, but do not accelerate, on the scheduled vesting dates into retirement subject to the recipient's compliance with certain post-employment covenants. Since recipients of RSUs with continued vesting provisions have satisfied the service requirement of the award at the date of grant, the Company recognizes all of the stock-based compensation expense associated with the RSUs awarded to retirement eligible employees in the period the award is granted.  
    
  Restricted stock and RSU activity was as follows:    

102 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

The total fair value of restricted stock and RSUs vested and the related tax benefit realized were as follows: 

Long-term Performance Plan (LTPP) 
  In 2004, we established the LTPP, which provides for restricted stock unit awards granted from our stock plans to our senior leadership. Recipients of LTPP awards have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalent units. The vesting of LTTP awards and related dividend equivalent units is based upon the achievement of specific pre-established levels of performance at the end of a   three  -year performance cycle. In the event of a retirement, vesting for awards will not accelerate and instead will vest in accordance with the original vesting conditions on a pro-rated basis. 
    
  The performance goals for the three outstanding performance cycles at   December 31, 2015  , are independent of each other and based on three metrics, as defined in the award agreements: return on invested capital (ROIC), weighted at   50%  ; total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group, weighted at   25%  ; and cumulative free cash flow from continuing operations (CFCF), weighted at   25%  . Depending on the achievement of these metrics, a recipient of the award is entitled to receive a number of ordinary shares equal to a percentage, ranging from   zero   to   200%   of the award granted. 
    
  Compensation expense for the awards is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date through the end of the performance period based upon the value determined under the intrinsic value method for the CFCF and ROIC portions of the award and the Monte Carlo simulation method for the TSR portion of the award. Compensation expense for the CFCF and ROIC portions of the awards will be adjusted based upon the expected achievement of those performance goals. 
    
  The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo model for the TSR portion of the awards granted during each year were as follows:

The total fair value of LTPP units vested and the related tax benefit realized were as follows: 

In the third quarter of 2015, Forcepoint established long-term incentive plans that provide for awards of unit appreciation rights and profits interests in the joint venture to Forcepoint management and key employees. Awards are approved by the Board of Forcepoint. These awards vest over a specified period of time and settlement is subject to a liquidity event defined as either a change in control or an initial public offering of the joint venture. In   2015  , Forcepoint issued   12 thousand   unit appreciation rights, all of which remained outstanding at   December 31, 2015  . Also in   2015  , Forcepoint issued   53 thousand   profits interests,   1 thousand   of which were forfeited and   52 thousand   of which remained outstanding at   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of the awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period when achievement of the liquidity event is considered probable.   No   compensation expense has been recognized for these plans to date. 
  The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model and the weighted-average grant date fair value for the Forcepoint awards granted in 2015 were as follows:

Stock Options 
  In 2004, we changed the primary form of our broad-based equity compensation from stock options to restricted stock. There have been no stock options granted since 2005. There were   no   stock options outstanding at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
    Note 14: Pension and Other Employee Benefits 
  We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries (Pension Benefits). Our primary pension obligations relate to our domestic IRS qualified pension plans. We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees and to eligible employees upon retirement through other postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. 
    
  The fair value of plan assets for our domestic and foreign Pension Benefits plans was as follows: 

We maintain a defined contribution plan that includes a 401(k) plan. Covered employees hired or rehired after January 1, 2007 are eligible for a Company contribution based on age and service, instead of participating in our pension plans. These and other covered employees are eligible to contribute up to a specific percentage of their pay to the 401(k) plan. We match the employee s contribution, generally up to   3%   or   4%   of the employee s pay, which is invested in the same way as employee contributions. Total expense for our contributions was   $276 million  ,   $274 million   and   $279 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there was   $14.6 billion   and   $14.9 billion   invested in our defined contribution plan, respectively. At   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  ,   $1.5 billion   and   $1.4 billion   of these amounts were invested in our stock fund, respectively. 
    
  We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. We have set aside certain assets in a separate trust, which we expect to be used to pay for trust obligations. The fair value of marketable securities held in trust, which are considered Level 1 assets under the fair value hierarchy, consisted of the following at December 31: 

Included in marketable securities held in trust in the table above was   $337 million   and   $328 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, related to the nonqualified defined contribution plans. The liabilities related to the nonqualified defined contribution plans were   $337 million   and   $327 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. 
    
  We also maintain additional contractual pension benefits agreements for certain executive officers. The liability associated with such agreements was   $38 million   and   $39 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. 
    
  Contributions and Benefit Payments 
  We may make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined in accordance with the Pension Protection Act (PPA), which amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) rules and are affected by the actual return on plan assets (ROA) and plan funded status. The funding requirements under the PPA require us to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of the year.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

In July 2012, the Surface Transportation Extension Act (STE Act), was passed by Congress and signed by the President. The STE Act includes a provision for temporary pension funding relief due to the low interest rate environment. The provision adjusts the 24-month average high quality corporate bond rates used to determine the PPA funded status so that they are within a floor and cap, or  corridor,  based on the 25-year average of corporate bond rates. The STE Act gradually phased out this interest rate provision beginning in 2013. Subsequent to the STE Act, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA) and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA) further extended this interest rate provision until 2020, at which time the provision is gradually phased out.    
    
  We made the following contributions to our pension and PRB plans during the years ended December 31:     

We periodically evaluate whether to make additional discretionary contributions. We expect to make required contributions of approximately   $140 million   and   $25 million   to our pension and PRB plans, respectively, in   2016  . 
    
  The table below reflects the total Pension Benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants  share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. PRB Benefits expected to be paid reflect our portion only. 

Defined Benefit Retirement Plan Summary Financial Information 
  The tables below outline the components of net periodic benefit expense (income) and related actuarial assumptions of our domestic and foreign Pension Benefits and PRB Benefits plans.    

Net periodic pension expense (income) also includes income from foreign Pension Benefits plans of   $5 million   in   2015  , income of   $9 million   in   2014   and expense of   $4 million   and   2013  .

The projected benefit obligation (PBO) represents the present value of Pension Benefits earned through the end of the year, with an allowance for future salary increases. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is similar to the PBO, but does not provide for future salary increases. The PBO, ABO and asset values for our domestic qualified pension plans were as follows:  

The PBO and fair value of plans assets for Pension Benefits plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets were   $24,699 million   and   $18,111 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015   and   $25,916 million   and   $19,459 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  . 
    
  The ABO and fair value of plan assets for Pension Benefits plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets were   $22,546 million   and   $18,111 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015   and   $23,520 million   and   $19,406 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  . The ABO for all Pension Benefits plans was   $23,286 million   and   $24,298 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. 
    
  The tables below provide a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and related actuarial assumptions of our domestic and foreign Pension Benefits and PRB plans. 

The PBO for our domestic and foreign Pension Benefits plans was   $24,605 million   and   $840 million  , respectively at   December 31, 2015   and   $25,745 million   and   $904 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  .

* Currently at the ultimate trend rate. 
    
  The weighted-average year-end benefit obligation discount rate for our domestic Pension Benefits plans was   4.47%   and   4.08%   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. Our foreign Pension Benefits plan assumptions have been included in the Pension Benefits assumptions in the table above. 
    
  The long-term ROA represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. The long-term ROA used to calculate net periodic pension cost is set annually at the beginning of each year. Given the long-term nature of the ROA assumption, which we believe should not be solely reactive to short-term market conditions that may not persist, we expect the long-term ROA to remain unchanged unless there

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

are significant changes in our investment strategy, the underlying economic assumptions, or other major factors. To establish our long-term ROA assumption we employ a  building block  approach. 
    
  As part of our annual process for determining whether it is appropriate to change our long-term ROA assumption, we first review the existing long-term ROA assumption against a statistically determined reasonable range of outcomes. For purposes of determining the long-term ROA assumption for 2014 and prior, we considered this range to be between the 25th and 75th percentile likelihood of achieving a long-term return over future years, consistent with the Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 27, Selection of Economic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations (ASOP 27) in effect at the time. Therefore, it is less than 25% likely that the long-term return of the pension plan would fall below or above the 25th and 75th percentiles points, respectively (i.e., it is 50% likely that the long-term return of the pension plan will be within the 25th and 75th percentile range). In September 2013, the Actuarial Standards Board issued a revision to ASOP 27, that replaced the explicit reference to the best estimate range concept with the selection of a reasonable assumption that considers multiple criteria including the purposes of measurement, the actuary s professional judgment, historical and current economic data and estimates of future experience and has no significant bias. The revised standard is effective for assumptions established on or after September 30, 2014. As a result of the revised standard, we continue to evaluate our long-term ROA assumption against a reasonable range of possible outcomes but, effective for our 2015 and future years assumptions, we modified that range to be between the 35th to 65th percentile likelihood of achieving a long-term return over future years. We believe that continuing to validate our ROA assumption within a reasonable range that is narrowed to the 35th to 65th percentiles ensures an unbiased result while also ensuring that the ROA assumption is not solely reactive to short-term market conditions that may not persist, and is consistent with external actuarial practices. The building block approach and the reasonable range of outcomes are based upon our asset allocation assumptions and long-term capital market assumptions. Such assumptions incorporate the economic outlook for various asset classes over short- and long-term periods and also take into consideration other factors, including historical market performance, inflation and interest rates. 
    
  The reasonable range of long-term returns that was used to validate the long-term ROA assumption for the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for     2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , are shown below. 

The long-term domestic ROA of 8.75% for 2014 and 2013 fell between the 60th 65th percentile and 65th 70th percentile of the applicable reasonable range for     2014   and   2013  , respectively. The 50th percentile of the reasonable range used to develop the     2014   and   2013     long-term ROA was 7.59% and 7.51%, respectively.    
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we reduced our long-term target allocation for equities and increased our target allocation for fixed income within the investment policy allocations established by our Investment Committee in order to reduce the overall exposure to equity volatility. This change in asset allocation reduced the range of reasonable outcomes that we use to evaluate our long-term ROA assumption and we determined that the historical assumption of 8.75% no longer fell within this range. To develop our 2015 long-term ROA assumption, we employed a building block approach. Under this building block method, the overall expected investment return equals the weighted-average of the individual expected return for each asset class based on the target asset allocation and the long-term capital market assumptions. The expected return for each asset class is composed of inflation plus a risk-free rate of return, plus an expected risk premium for that asset class. The resulting return is then adjusted for administrative, investment management and trading expenses as well as recognition of alpha for active management. The building block approach resulted in a long-term ROA assumption of 8.0% for 2015. To validate this assumption we compared the result against the reasonable range of outcomes and confirmed that the 8.0% result falls between the 55th 60th percentile of the reasonable range for 2015 with the 50th percentile at 7.37%. In addition, when we updated our target asset allocation and our long-term ROA assumption changed from 8.75% to 8.0%, we assessed what our historical asset performance may have been since 1986 using the updated target allocation and concluded the average return would likely have been equal to or greater than 8.0% for the time period from 1986 through 2014.

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

Based upon our application of the building block approach and our review of the resulting assumption against the 35th to 65th reasonable range and an analysis of our historical results, we have established a 2015 long-term ROA assumption of 8.0% and have determined that the new assumption is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of ASOP 27.    
    
  Our domestic pension plans  actual rates of return were approximately 0%, 6% and 15% for     2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. The difference between the actual rate of return and our long-term ROA assumption is included in deferred losses.    
    
  The long-term ROA assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans are based on the asset allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of our Pension Benefits plans. 
    
  For purposes of determining pension expense under U.S. GAAP,   a  corridor  approach may be elected and applied in the recognition of asset and liability gains or losses which limits expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the calculated "market-related value" of assets. We do not use a  corridor  approach in the calculation of FAS expense. 
    
  The effect of a   1%   increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend rate for each future year for the aggregate of service cost and interest cost is less than   $1 million   and for the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is a   $6 million   increase or decrease. 
    
  Plan Assets 
  Substantially all our domestic Pension Benefits Plan (Plan) assets, which consist of investments in cash and cash equivalents, publicly traded U.S. and international equity securities, private equity funds, private real estate funds, fixed-income securities, commingled funds and other investments such as insurance contracts and derivatives, are held in a master trust, which was established for the investment of assets of our Company-sponsored retirement plans. The assets of the master trust are overseen by our Investment Committee comprised of members of senior management drawn from appropriate diversified levels of the executive management team. 
    
  The Investment Committee is responsible for setting the policy that provides the framework for management of the Plan assets. In accordance with its responsibilities and charter, the Investment Committee meets on a regular basis to review the performance of the Plan assets and compliance with the investment policy. The policy sets forth an investment structure for managing Plan assets, including setting the asset allocation ranges, which are expected to provide an appropriate level of overall diversification and total investment return over the long term while maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay the benefits of the Plan. In developing the asset allocation ranges, third-party asset allocation studies are periodically performed that consider the current and expected positions of the plan assets and funded status. Based on these studies and other appropriate information, the Investment Committee establishes asset allocation ranges taking into account acceptable risk targets and associated returns. 
    
  The investment policy asset allocation ranges for the Plan, as set by the Investment Committee, for the year ended   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The Investment Committee appoints the investment fiduciary, who is responsible for making investment decisions within the framework of the Investment Policy, setting the long-term target allocation within the investment policy asset allocation ranges and for supervising the internal pension investment team. The pension investment team is comprised of experienced investment  

111 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

professionals, who are all employees of the Company. The investment fiduciary reports back to the Investment Committee. During times of unusual market conditions, the investment fiduciary may seek authorization from the Investment Committee to change the investing allocation ranges to reasonably limit excessive volatility or other undesirable consequences. 
    
  Taking into account the asset allocation ranges, the investment fiduciary determines the specific allocation of the Plan s investments within various asset classes. The Plan utilizes select investment strategies which are executed through separate account or fund structures with external investment managers who demonstrate experience and expertise in the appropriate asset classes and styles. The selection of investment managers is done with careful evaluation of all aspects of performance and risk, due diligence of internal operations and controls, reputation, systems evaluation and a review of investment managers' policies and processes. The Plan also utilizes funds that track an index and are highly liquid. Investment performance is monitored frequently against appropriate benchmarks and tracked to compliance guidelines with the assistance of third-party performance evaluation tools and metrics. 
    
  Consistent with the objective of optimizing return on investment while taking into account investment risks that are prudent and reasonable given prevailing market conditions, multiple investment strategies are employed to diversify risk such that no single investment or manager holding represents a significant exposure to the total investment portfolio. Plan assets are invested in numerous diversified strategies with the intent to minimize correlations. This allows for diversification of returns. Plan assets can be invested in funds that track an index and are designed to achieve broad market diversification. The Plan had   $2.2 billion   invested in such funds across   three   indices as of   December 31, 2015  . Other than funds that track an index, no individual investment strategy represented more than   5%   of the Plan as of   December 31, 2015  . Further, within each separate account strategy, guidelines are established which set forth the list of authorized investments, the typical portfolio characteristics and diversification required by limiting the amount that can be invested by sector, country and issuer.  
    
  The Plan s investments are stated at fair value. Investments in equity securities (common and preferred) are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. Investments in fixed-income securities are generally valued using methods based upon market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are generally recognized by institutional traders. Investments in private equity funds, private real estate funds and other commingled funds are estimated at fair market value, which primarily utilizes net asset values reported by the investment manager or fund administrator. We review additional valuation and pricing information from fund managers, including audited financial statements, to evaluate the net asset values.

The fair value of our Plan assets by asset category and by level (as described in "Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies") at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014   were as follows:    

(1) 
    U.S. and International equities primarily include investments across the spectrum of large, medium and small market capitalization stocks. 
              (2) 
    Corporate debt securities/instruments include investment grade and non-investment grade bonds. 
              (3) 
    Core fixed-income securities are funds that invest primarily in intermediate-term high quality domestic bonds issued by various governmental or private sector entities. 
              (4) 
    Global multi-sector fixed-income investments are funds that invest globally among several sectors including governments, investment grade corporate bonds, high yield corporate bonds and emerging market bonds.

(5) 
    Securitized and structured credit include fixed-income funds and securities that pool together various cash flow producing financial assets that are structured in a way that can achieve desired targeted credit, maturity or other characteristics and are typically collateralized by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other assets, and other fixed income related securities. 
              (6) 
    Cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market funds. Included in cash and cash equivalents is excess cash in investment manager accounts. This cash is available for immediate use and is used to fund daily operations and execute the investment policy. This amount is not considered to be part of the cash target allocation set forth in the investment policy. 
              (7) 
    Receivables, payables and certain investments that are valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amount presented for the total domestic pension benefits plan assets. 
       
  A reconciliation of investments with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) has not been provided as the amounts are immaterial. 
    
  The Plan limits the use of derivatives through direct or separate account investments such that the derivatives used are liquid and able to be readily valued in the market. Derivative usage in separate account structures is limited to hedging purposes or to gain market exposure in a non-speculative manner. The fair market value of the Plan s derivatives through direct or separate account investments was approximately less than   $1 million   and   $(7) million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. 
    
  In addition, assets are held in trust for non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans, primarily in the U.K. and Canada, which are governed locally in accordance with specific jurisdictional requirements. These assets are overseen by local management in Canada and by trustees with a combination of members representing plan participants and local management in the U.K. Investments in the non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans consist primarily of fixed-income securities and equity securities and had a fair market value of   $837 million   and   $868 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. These investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as well as significant observable inputs (Level 2). Investments with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are immaterial in the non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans. 
    
  The fair market value of assets related to our PRB Benefits was   $380 million   and   $418 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively. These assets included   $169 million   and   $185 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, that were invested in the master trust described above and are therefore invested in the same assets described above. The remaining investments are held within Voluntary Employees  Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts. The assets of the VEBA trusts are also overseen by the Investment Committee and managed by the same investment fiduciary that manages the master trust s investments. These assets are generally invested in mutual funds and are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as well as significant observable inputs (Level 2). There were no Level 3 investments in the VEBA trusts at   December 31, 2015   or   December 31, 2014  . 
    
  The table below details assets by category for our VEBA trusts. These assets consist primarily of publicly-traded equity securities and publicly-traded fixed-income securities.

Note 15: Income Taxes 
  The provision for federal and foreign income taxes consisted of the following:    

The expense for income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following:    

In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted to permanently reinstate the Research   Development tax credit (R D tax credit) which had expired on December 31, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a full year benefit of approximately   $33 million   related to the 2015 R D tax credit. In 2014, we recorded a full year benefit of approximately   $30 million   related to the 2014 R D tax credit. 
  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We have participated in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) program since 2011. In the second quarter of 2015 the IRS completed the examination for the 2013 tax year, which completed all examinations through 2013. As a result of closing federal and state audit examinations, our unrecognized tax benefits decreased by approximately   $100 million  , inclusive of interest, the majority of which impacted income from continuing operations. We continue to participate in the CAP program for the 2014 and 2015 tax years. We are also under audit by multiple state and foreign tax authorities. 
  During 2014, a foreign subsidiary authorized and completed a transaction which resulted in a taxable dividend of approximately   $115 million  . The transaction did not affect our indefinite reinvestment assertion because it generated a net tax benefit of approximately   $80 million  . 
  During 2013, the IRS completed its examination of our 2009 and 2012 tax years and we received final approval from the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of a refund claim related to the 2011 tax year. As a result of closing the federal audit examinations, our unrecognized tax benefits decreased by approximately   $70 million  , inclusive of interest, the majority of which did not impact our income from continuing operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

At   December 31, 2015  , foreign earnings of approximately   $688 million   have been retained by foreign subsidiaries for reinvestment. No provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings have been indefinitely invested or are expected to be remitted substantially free of additional tax. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexity of laws and regulations, the varying tax treatment of alternative repatriation scenarios, and the variation due to multiple potential assumptions relating to the timing of any future repatriation. 
    
  We made the following net tax payments during the years ended December 31: 

We believe that our income tax reserves are adequate; however, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than amounts accrued and reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, we could record adjustments to the amounts for federal, foreign and state tax-related liabilities in the future as we revise estimates or we settle or otherwise resolve the underlying matters. In the ordinary course of business, we may take new positions that could increase or decrease our unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. 
    
  The balance of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, was   $7 million   and   $104 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, the majority of which would affect earnings if recognized. We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. At   December 31, 2015  ,   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , we had   $2 million  ,   $6 million   and   $5 million   of interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, which, net of the federal tax benefit, was approximately   $0.5 million  ,   $4 million   and   $3 million  , respectively. 
    
  A rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:    

With the exception of Forcepoint, we generally account for our state income tax expense as a deferred contract cost, to the extent we can recover this expense through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We include this deferred amount in contracts in process, net, until allocated to our contracts, which generally occurs upon payment or when otherwise agreed as allocable with the U.S. government. Net state income tax expense allocated to our contracts was   $28 million  ,   $41 million   and   $42 million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively. We include state income tax expense allocated to our contracts in administrative and selling expenses.

Deferred income taxes consisted of the following at December 31:   

As of   December 31, 2015  , we had U.S. federal and State net operating loss carryforwards related to Forcepoint of approximately   $155 million   and   $114 million  , respectively, which expire at various dates through 2034. We also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $133 million  , with the majority generated in the U.K. where net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely. We believe that we have sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. 
    
  The tax expense (benefit) related to discontinued operations was   $(14) million  ,   $23 million   and   $(5) million   in   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , respectively.

These amounts are included in Forcepoint Acquisition Accounting Adjustments.  

We must calculate our pension and PRB costs under both FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP and CAS. U.S. GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not indicative of the funding requirements for pension and PRB plans that we determine by other factors. CAS prescribes the allocation to and recovery of pension and PRB costs on U.S. government contracts. The results of each segment only include pension and PRB expense as determined under CAS. The CAS requirements for pension costs and its calculation methodology differ from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. As a result, while both FAS and CAS use long-term assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of pension and PRB cost. The FAS/CAS Adjustment, which is reported as a separate line in our segment results above, represents the difference between our pension and PRB expense or income under FAS in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under CAS. 
    
  The components of the FAS/CAS Adjustment were as follows:

    ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Management has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Conclusion of Evaluation   Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of   December 31, 2015   were effective.  
    
  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

              2.

              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
