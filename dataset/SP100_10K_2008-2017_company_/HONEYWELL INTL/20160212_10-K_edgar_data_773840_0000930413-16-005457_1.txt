PART I.   
    Item 1. Business    
  Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell or the Company) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, turbochargers, control, sensing and security technologies for buildings, homes and industry, specialty chemicals, electronic
  and advanced materials, process technology for refining and petrochemicals, and energy efficient products and solutions for homes, business and transportation. Honeywell was incorporated in Delaware in 1985.  
  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our website (www.honeywell.com) under the heading Investor Relations (see SEC Filings   Reports) immediately after they are filed with, or
  furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, in this Form 10-K, the Company incorporates by reference certain information from parts of its Proxy Statement for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which we expect to file with the SEC on or about March 10, 2016, and which will
  also be available free of charge on our website.  
   Major Businesses   
  We globally manage our business operations through three operating segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions (ACS), and Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT). Financial information related to our operating segments is included in Note 21 Segment Financial Data of Notes to
  Financial Statements.  
  The major products/services, customers/uses and key competitors of each of our operating segments are:  
   Aerospace   
  Aerospace is a leading global supplier of aircraft engines, integrated avionics, systems and service solutions, and related products and services for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft operators, military services, and defense and space contractors. Aerospace is also a leading manufacturer of
  turbochargers to improve the performance and efficiency of passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Aerospace products and services include auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, environmental control systems, connectivity, electric power systems, engine controls, flight safety, communications, navigation,
  radar and surveillance systems, aircraft lighting, management and technical services, logistics services, advanced systems and instruments, aircraft wheels and brakes, repair and overhaul services, turbochargers and thermal systems. Aerospace sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in
  the air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft, and automotive and truck manufacturers segments, and provides spare parts and repair and maintenance services (principally to aircraft operators) for the aftermarket.  
   Automation and Control Solutions   
  ACS is a leading global provider of products, software and technologies for environmental and energy solutions; sensors, switches and controls for sensing and productivity solutions; security and fire safety products; industrial safety products; and building solutions and services for homes, commercial
  buildings and industrial facilities. ACS products and services include controls and displays for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification, combustion, lighting and home automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems
  and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature and electrical current; products, services and solutions for measurement, regulation, control and metering of gases and electricity; metering and communications systems for water utilities and industries; security, fire and gas detection; personal
  protection equipment; access control; video surveillance; remote patient monitoring systems; software and products for high performance data collection including rugged  
  1  

mobile computers and printers, bar code scanners and voice technologies; and installation, maintenance and upgrades of systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive.  
   Performance Materials and Technologies   
  PMT is a global leader in developing and manufacturing advanced materials, process technologies and automation solutions. UOP provides process technology, products, including catalysts and adsorbents, equipment and consulting services to efficiently produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals and
  renewable fuels for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical, and other industries. Process Solutions is a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation, services and advanced software for the oil and gas, refining, pulp and paper, industrial power generation, chemicals and petrochemicals, biofuels,
  life sciences, and metals, minerals and mining industries. Advanced Materials manufactures a wide variety of high-performance products, including fluorocarbons, hydrofluoroolefins, caprolactam, resins, ammonium sulfate fertilizer, phenol, specialty films, waxes, additives, advanced fibers, customized research
  chemicals and intermediates, and electronic materials and chemicals.  
   Competition   
  We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are:  

Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin, General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and United Technologies   

ACS: 3M, Johnson Controls, Schneider, Siemens and Zebra-Motorola   

PMT: Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and Sinopec  

Our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there
  is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product
  and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs.  
   Aerospace Sales   
  Our sales to aerospace customers were 39%, 39%, and 40% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 8%, 6%, and 7% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services
  were 12%, 11%, and 11% of our total sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
   U.S. Government Sales   
  Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,743 million, $3,693 million and $3,856 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor
  and subcontractor, of $2,680 million, $2,792 million and $3,066 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. U.S. defense spending decreased in 2015 compared to 2014. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2016 federal defense spending due principally to the
  varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs  production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), increases in direct foreign defense and space market sales, as well as our diversified commercial businesses.  
  2  

Backlog   
  Our total backlog at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $18,183 million and $18,313 million. We anticipate that approximately $11,601 million of the 2015 backlog will be filled in 2016. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders
  constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer s option.  
   International Operations   
  We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 14% of our total sales in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly
  in Europe and Asia, were 39% of our total sales in 2015, and 41% in 2014 and 2013.  
 
   Raw Materials   
  The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2015. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a
  material amount of our raw materials, except related to R240 (a key component in foam blowing agents), a raw material used in PMT.  
  The costs of certain key raw materials, including cumene, natural gas, R240, sulfur, fluorspar, ethylene and perchloroethylene in PMT and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula
  or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2016.  
   Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights   
  Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are
  generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business.  
   Research and Development   
  The Company s principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development (R D) expense totaled $1,856 million, $1,892 million and $1,804 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. R D expense was 5% of sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Customer-sponsored
  (principally by the U.S. Government) R D activities amounted to an additional $998 million, $1,034 million and $969 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
   Environment   
  We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of
  resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental  
  3  

damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.  
  We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental
  damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or
  increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.  
  Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various
  hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency s National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible
  parties, to date we have not had to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.  
  We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company s business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures or financial
  position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.  
   Employees   
  We have approximately 129,000 employees at December 31, 2015, of whom approximately 49,000 are located in the United States.

Item 1A. Risk Factors    
   Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements   
  We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the
  meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
  Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on management s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic
  and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise
  any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular,
  the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.  
   Risk Factors   
  Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.  
    Macroeconomic and Industry Risks    
    Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.    

Aerospace   Operating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial Original Equipment and
      Commercial Aftermarket business units may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which
      impact business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results in our Defense and Space Systems business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may
      be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new
      automobile and truck platforms.   

ACS   Operating   results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and inventory
      levels in distribution channels.   

PMT   Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers  availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, and our ability to
      maximize our facilities  production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers  operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and    

6  

services. Pricing of certain chemical products are driven by raw materials that are correlated to the price of oil, hence revenue could be significantly impacted by volatility in the price of oil. 

An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.    
  Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade
  restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff
  and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other
  strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.  
  Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we
  generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and
  commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.  
    Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.    
  Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can
  result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon
  interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.  
    Operational Risks    
    Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.    
  The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in PMT (cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene) and Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to
  customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and
  components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be  
  7  

constrained by our suppliers  inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and
  profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  
    We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.    
  We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i)
  the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies, (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions,
  and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.  
    Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.    
  Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-
  traditional competitors, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) attract, develop
  and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers  needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.  
  The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.  
    Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.    
  Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line
  rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these
  actions may potentially disrupt our operations.  
    As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.    
  U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend
  downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.  
  8  

We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its
  businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.  
    Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.    
  Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We
  continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental
  matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit
  emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal
  toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  
    Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.    
  Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third
  party service providers including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to
  continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product
  software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation,
  destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused
  a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the
  value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.  
  9  

Legal and Regulatory Risks    
    Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.    
  Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally
  accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other
  governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-
  jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to address base erosion and profit shifting, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.  
    Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.    
  The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other
  things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy
  efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems. Within ACS, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. PMT s results of operations can be
  affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive.  
    We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.    
  We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and
  divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements,
  and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the
  total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.

   (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three
  years ended December 31, 2015. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
  In 2015, Honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic climate by combining strategic growth in our diverse portfolio and our well-known cost discipline with a marked acceleration of our capital deployment strategy. Earnings per share of common stock assuming dilution, grew 13% to $6.04
  per share in 2015 and net income attributable to Honeywell grew 12% to $4,768 million. Our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value resulted in segment margin expansion of 220 basis points versus 2014 without sacrificing seed planting intended to ensure future growth, including maintaining
  R D spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety and security and productivity, $216 million of repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in High Growth Regions. Honeywell Operating System (HOS) Gold and
  Honeywell User Experience (HUE) initiatives intensified throughout the company, driving productivity through sustainable improvements to our factories, footprints and supply chain.  
  In 2015 we deployed capital of over $10 billion, including the following:  

Mergers and Acquisitions   we deployed over $5 billion during 2015, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our three operating segments. These acquisitions all share a technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean
      energy generation, safety and security, urbanization and customer productivity.   

Dividend   after a 15% dividend rate increase in 2014, we again increased our annual dividend rate by 15% in 2015, as we seek to grow the dividend faster than earnings.   

Share Repurchases   we continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans. In 2015, we repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.9 billion.   

Capital Investment in Facilities   we invested over $1 billion in high return capital expenditures, focused on revenue growth projects such as our Solstice low global-warming potential refrigerant products for the automotive industry and catalyst products in UOP.  

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   Net Sales   
 
  15  

The change in net sales is attributable to the following:  
 
  A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MD A. The foreign currency translation impact is principally driven by the weakening of the Euro and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar.  
   Cost of Products and Services Sold   
 
  Cost of products and services sold decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to a decrease in direct and indirect material costs of approximately $1,460 million (driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, productivity, lower raw materials pass-through pricing and the
  absence of the Friction Materials business, partially offset by higher sales volume), a decrease in labor costs of approximately $450 million and higher pension income of approximately $230 million.  
  Gross margin percentage increased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 2.0 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension income allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point
  impact).  
  Cost of products and services sold increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to an increase in direct material and labor costs of approximately $645 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions, net of divestitures) and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of
  approximately $35 million, partially offset by a decrease in repositioning and other charges of approximately $40 million.  
  Gross margin percentage increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 0.7 percentage point impact collectively) and lower repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher
  pension and other postretirement benefit expense (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact).  
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, increased pension income, decreased indirect costs and benefits from repositioning, partially offset by increased labor costs (primarily merit
  increases and investment for growth).  
  SG A increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily driven by an increase in labor costs (primarily acquisitions, incentive compensation, merit increases and investment for growth) and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense, partially offset by a decrease in repositioning charges.  
  16  

Tax Expense   
 
  For discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes in the Notes to Financial Statements.  
  The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings, the vast majority of which we intend to permanently reinvest outside the United States.  
  The Company currently expects the effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 26.5%. The effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws or other items such as pension mark-to-market
  adjustments.  
   Net Income Attributable to Honeywell   
 
  Earnings per share of common stock assuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by increased tax expense and lower other income (principally due
  to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities).  
  Earnings per share of common stock assuming dilution increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower repositioning and other charges, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement expense and increased tax
  expense.  
   BUSINESS OVERVIEW   
  Our consolidated results are principally impacted by:  

Change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;   

Overall sales mix, in particular the mix of Aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of ACS products, distribution and services sales;   

The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. Dollar;   

The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; and   

The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements.  

Our 2016 areas of focus are supported by the Honeywell Enablers, including HOS Gold, are generally applicable to each of our operating segments and include:  

Driving profitable growth through R D, technological excellence and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value;   

Expanding margins by maintaining and improving the Company s cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other actions, which will drive productivity and enhance the flexibility of the business as it works to proactively respond to changes in end
      market demand;   

17  

Driving strong cash flow conversion through effective working capital management which will enable the Company to deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures and returning cash to shareholders;   

Driving organic growth through expansion of our localized footprint in high growth regions, including China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America;   

Executing disciplined, rigorous M A and integration processes to deliver inorganic growth through previously announced acquisitions while also identifying appropriate acquisitions to further deploy our capital effectively;   

Aligning and prioritizing capital expenditures for long-term growth, while considering short-term demand volatility;   

Actively monitoring trends in the oil and gas industry end markets, principally the demand from midstream and downstream customers for products and services provided by Process Solutions and UOP;   

Monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resultjing inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary;   

Proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long-term supply agreements and hedging activities, where feasible and prudent; and   

Controlling corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and tax expense.  

Review of Business Segments   
 
  18  

Aerospace   

2015 compared with 2014   
  Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below, and a decrease in incentives predominantly to air transport and regional aviation original equipment
  manufacturers (OEM Incentives).  

Commercial Original Equipment sales increased by 11% (increased 5% organic) primarily driven by a decrease in OEM Incentives and higher business and general aviation engine shipments.   

Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 2% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities, partially offset by lower retrofits, modifications and upgrades for business and general aviation customers.   

Defense and Space sales decreased by 1% (flat organic) primarily due to lower U.S. government revenue, partially offset by growth in international programs.   

Transportation Systems sales decreased by 19% (increased 3% organic) primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration.  

Aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit and a 6% favorable impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly the absence of higher prior year OEM Incentives), as discussed above, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign
  currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily driven by productivity, net of inflation, and favorable pricing, partially offset by continued investments for growth. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the
  Friction Materials divestiture, and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by continued investments for growth.  
   2014 compared with 2013   
  Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture and an increase in OEM incentives, partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below.  

Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased by 2% (increased by 3% organic) primarily due to an increase in OEM Incentives to air transport and regional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), partially offset by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OEMs  higher production rates, and
      business and general aviation engine shipments.   

Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher sales of spare parts to air transport and regional customers, partially offset by a decline in retrofits, modifications and    

19  

upgrades and lower repair and overhaul activities for our business and general aviation customers.   

Defense and Space sales decreased by 2% primarily due to lower U.S. government services revenue and the absence of a prior year royalty gain, partially offset by growth in international programs.   

Transportation Systems sales decreased by 3% (increased by 5% organic) primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches, higher global turbo gas penetration and increased commercial vehicle demand in Europe.  

Aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit, partially offset by a 6% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly higher OEM Incentives and the absence of a prior year royalty gain), as discussed above. The increase in
  operational segment profit is driven primarily by favorable price and productivity, net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the factors discussed above (excluding price).  
   Automation and Control Solutions   

2015 compared with 2014   
  ACS sales decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by organic sales growth and growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures.  

Sales in Energy, Safety   Security decreased by 2% (increased by 2% organic) principally due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by organic sales growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Organic sales growth was primarily due to increased sales volumes, most
      significantly in Security and Fire across all regions, as well as Sensing   Productivity Solutions.   

Sales in Building Solutions   Distribution decreased by 4% (increased by 2% organic) principally due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Organic sales growth was primarily due to increased sales volume in Americas Distribution partially offset by softness in the project installation and
      U.S. energy retrofit businesses, which is expected to continue.  

ACS segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit and acquisitions, net of divestitures partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to the positive impact of price and productivity net of inflation
  and higher organic sales volumes partially offset by continued investments for growth. Cost of products and services decreased primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and productivity partially offset by higher organic sales volume and inflation.  
  20  

2014 compared with 2013   
  ACS sales increased primarily due to growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures and organic sales growth, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.  

Sales in Energy, Safety   Security increased by 11% (4% organic) principally due to (i) acquisitions, net of divestitures, (ii) higher global sales volumes in our Environmental   Energy Solutions business driven by strong U.S. residential market conditions and new product introductions, (iii) increases in sales
      volumes in our Security and Fire and Industrial Safety businesses driven by organic growth in all regions and (iv) increases in sales volumes in our Sensing   Productivity Solutions business in the second half of 2014.   

Sales in Building Solutions   Distribution increased by 1% (2% organic) principally due to increased sales volumes in our Americas Distribution business partially offset by softness in the U.S. energy retrofit business. Building Solutions backlog increased in 2014.  

ACS segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit and acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily the result of higher sales volumes as discussed above, and the
  positive impact of price and productivity, net of inflation partially offset by continued investment for growth. Cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher sales volume, acquisitions, net of divestitures and inflation, partially offset by productivity and the favorable impact of foreign currency
  translation.  

     Performance Materials and Technologies   

2015 compared with 2014   
  Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT) sales decreased due to a decrease in organic sales volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.  

UOP sales decreased 7% (decreased 6% organic) driven primarily by lower gas processing revenues due to a significant slowdown in customer projects, which is expected to continue, and decreased equipment, engineering and licensing revenues partially offset by increased catalyst revenues.   

Process Solutions sales decreased 12% (decreased 3% organic) driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lower volumes primarily due to weakness in projects and field products, which is expected to moderate during 2016.   

Advanced Materials sales decreased 10% (decreased 7% organic) primarily driven by lower raw material pass-through pricing and unplanned plant outages in Resins and Chemicals partially offset by increased volumes in Fluorine Products. We anticipate volatility in raw materials pass-through pricing to
      continue in 2016 primarily in Resins and Chemicals where sales fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials, which are correlated to the price of oil.  

21  

PMT segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to price and productivity net of inflation partially offset by lower organic sales volumes and
  continued investments for growth. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the favorable impacts of inflation, foreign currency translation, lower organic sales volumes and productivity, partially offset by continued investments for growth.  
   2014 compared with 2013   
  PMT sales increased due to an increase in organic sales partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.  

UOP sales increased by 8% driven primarily by higher catalyst and gas processing volumes partially offset by lower equipment and service revenues in the first nine months. Catalyst sales decreased in the fourth quarter due to the timing of shipments as well as stronger volume growth in the fourth quarter
      of 2013 as compared to 2014 which was partially offset by increased licensing revenues.   

Sales in our Process Solutions business increased by 1% (4% organic) driven primarily by volume growth in advanced solutions software and services and field products partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, predominately in the fourth quarter. Project and service orders and backlog
      increased in 2014.   

Advanced Materials sales increased by 3% primarily driven by increased volume in Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals, partially offset by unfavorable pricing most significantly in Fluorine Products and lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals. We anticipate lower raw
      materials pass-through pricing to continue in 2015 primarily in Resins and Chemicals where sales fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials, which are correlated to the price of oil.  

PMT segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher sales volumes, as discussed above, and productivity, net of inflation partially offset by
  unfavorable Advanced Materials pricing, continued investment for growth and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher volume and continued investment for growth partially offset by productivity, net of inflation and the favorable impact of foreign
  currency translation.  
   Repositioning Charges   
  See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2015, 2014 and 2013. These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $175 million to $200 million in 2016 compared
  with 2015 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $118 million, $161 million and $160 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2016, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $175
  million and to be funded through operating cash flows.  
  22  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
  The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term
  borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends.  
   Cash Flow Summary   
  Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows:  
 
   2015 compared with 2014   
  Cash provided by operating activities increased by $430 million primarily due to a $489 million favorable impact from working capital and a $382 million increase in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by (i) a $175 million decrease in customer advances and
  deferred income, (ii) $151 million in OEM incentives and (iii) increased cash tax payments of $50 million.  
  Cash used for investing activities increased by $4,638 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $5,224 million, most significantly the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), and a decrease in proceeds of $159 million, primarily from the Friction Materials divestiture, partially
  offset by a net $659 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities.  
  Cash provided by financing activities increased by $2,374 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $3,648 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,039 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $216 million.  
   2014 compared with 2013   
  Cash provided by operating activities increased by $689 million primarily due to (i) a $508 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (ii) reduced net payments for repositioning and other charges of $233 million primarily due to the collection of a $130 million
  asbestos receivable due from one of our insurance carriers and lower asbestos related payments of $98 million, (iii) reduced cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $131 million and (iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $129 million, partially offset by a $93 million unfavorable
  impact from working capital primarily driven by higher inventory to support sales growth.  
  Cash used for investing activities decreased by $83 million primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1,129 million most significantly Intermec and RAE Systems, Inc. in 2013 and an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $157 million (most significantly Friction Materials),
  partially offset by (i) a net $688 million increase in investments primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of approximately $371 million in settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency

denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a $147 million increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment.  
  Cash used for financing activities increased by $1,839 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,589 million, an increase in cash dividends paid of $157 million and lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $33 million.  
   Liquidity   
  Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies,
  including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt
  from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2015, a substantial portion of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current
  law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be
  repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.  
  We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these
  entities.  
  A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as
  well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.26% and 0.60%.  
  Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2015, Standard and Poor s (S P),
  Fitch, and Moody s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. S P, Fitch and Moody s have Honeywell s rating outlook as  stable.  To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.  
  We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of
  any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.  
  During 2015, the Company entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. See Note 12 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on the credit agreements.  
  During 2015, the Company repurchased $1,884 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In December 2013, the Board of Directors authorized
  the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, $2.2 billion remained available as of December 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation
  plans, including future option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans.  
  24  

In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to
  repositioning actions and debt repayments.  
  Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2016 to be as follows:  

Capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2016 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.   

Share repurchases under the Company s share repurchase program, $2.2 billion is available as of December 31, 2015 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based
      compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.   

Dividends we increased our dividend rate by 15% to $.5950 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2015 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2016.   

Asbestos claims we expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $295 million and $25 million in 2016.   

Pension contributions in 2016, we are not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $160 million ($106 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2016) to our non-U.S. plans to satisfy
      regulatory funding standards. The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.   

Repositioning actions we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $175 million in 2016.   

Environmental remediation costs we expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2016 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.   

Acquisitions we acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC for approximately $240 million in January 2016. In addition, in February 2016 we acquired COM DEV International for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $330 million and entered into a definitive
      agreement to acquire Xtralis International Holdings Limited for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $480 million.  

We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will
  further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning
  actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2015 and 2014, we realized $1 million and $160 million in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses.  
  Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to
  fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.

Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments   
  Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2015:  

(1)   

Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity.   

(2)   

Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements.   

(3)   

The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2015.   

(4)   

These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2015. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for
      additional information.   

(5)   

These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2015. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.   

(6)   

The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.  

Environmental Matters   
  Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $194 million, $268 million and $272 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, in 2015 and 2014 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $90 million and $88 million relating to compliance with
  environmental regulations.  
  Spending related to known environmental matters was $273 million, $321 million and $304 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and is estimated to be approximately $250 million in 2016. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures
  depends on a numbers of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties.  
  See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters.  
   Financial Instruments   
  The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments  
  26  

based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2015 and 2014.  

(1)   

Asset or (liability).   

(2)   

A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in
      fair value equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table.   

(3)   

Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions.  

See Note 14 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements.  
   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We
  consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.  
    Contingent Liabilities   We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government
  contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges
  of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental
  matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts,
  changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of  
  27  

management s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.  
    Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries   Honeywell s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and
  conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted
  against the NARCO Trust through 2018. In light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims from January 2002 through the effective date of the NARCO Trust on April 30, 2013, we do
  not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future
  anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain
  factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.  
  In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with
  our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to
  various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the
  projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.  
  See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of management s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.  
    Defined Benefit Pension Plans   We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan
  obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment
  (MTM Adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense).  
  The key assumptions used in developing our 2015, 2014 and 2013 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following:  
 
  The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the  
  28  

various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on
  plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $67 million, $249 million and $51 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
  We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial
  Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2016 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods
  combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plan s investments.  
  The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing
  interest rates as of the measurement date. We will use a 4.46% discount rate as of December 31, 2015, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.  
  In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income)
  expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment:  

Change in Assumption    

Impact on 2016 Pension Ongoing
      Expense    

Impact on PBO    

0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate   

Decrease $19 million   

Increase $490 million   

0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate   

Increase $17 million   

Decrease $470 million   

0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   

Increase $40 million   

0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   

Decrease $40 million   

Pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $580 million in 2016 compared with pension ongoing income of $430 million in 2015. The expected increase is primarily due to lower service and interest costs resulting mainly from the change in our discount rate
  methodology as described in Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements and the plan amendment in the fourth quarter of 2015 to freeze final average compensation in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2015 partially offset by the impact of lower asset returns in
  2015. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2016, and if one is required what the magnitude of such
  adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.  
    Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets)   The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could
  materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group
  may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:  
  29  

Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;   

Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;   

Significant negative industry or economic trends; or   

Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.  

Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is
  considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value
  hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected.  
    Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing   In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value
  assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on
  key estimates and assumptions.  
    Income Taxes   On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax
  planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.  
    Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts   In 2015, we recognized approximately 14% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis
  for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and
  award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on
  negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization,
  and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing
  and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
   Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
    Accounting Principles   The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywell s significant accounting policies.  
    Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not
  control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee s activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost
  method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.  
  Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interest s share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.  
    Property, Plant and Equipment   Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and
  improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related
  long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset s useful life.  
    Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets   Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values
  to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2015 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date.  
    Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives   Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.  
    Sales Recognition   Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance
  and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts.
  Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to
  customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.  
    Environmental   We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.  
    Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries   We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection  
  37  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.  
    Aerospace Sales Incentives   We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These
  incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate.  
    Research and Development   Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $1,856 million, $1,892 million and $1,804 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
    Stock-Based Compensation Plans   The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair
  value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to
  recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates.  
    Pension Benefits   We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans  projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement
  is triggered. The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense).  
    Foreign Currency Translation   Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during
  the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate
  in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.  
    Derivative Financial Instruments   We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage
  risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly,
  changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.  
  All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives  
  38  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified
  consistent with the underlying hedged item.  
    Income Taxes   Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain
  and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and
  foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax
  provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.  
    Earnings Per Share   Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  
    Reclassifications   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements   We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
  operations.  
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by permitting classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has elected to early adopt the
  guidance on a prospective basis effective with the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. This is a change from the Company s historical presentation whereby certain deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as non-current. Adoption of the
  guidance resulted in a reclassification of $662 million from current assets and $32 million from current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at
  an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in
  the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts
  with customers. The effective date was deferred for one year to the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The guidance permits the use of either a
  retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.

   Note 2. Acquisitions   
  During 2015, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash acquired) of $5,244 million.  
  On December 29, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), a leading provider of thermal gas solutions for commercial, industrial, and residential heating systems and gas, water, and electricity meters, including smart meters and software and data
  analytics solutions, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of approximately $4,899 million. Elster had 2015 revenues of approximately $1,670 million and will primarily be integrated into ACS. The following amounts represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired
  and liabilities assumed that are included in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.  
 
  The identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, trade names and technology that are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results from the
  date of acquisition through December 31, 2015 were included principally in ACS and were not material to the consolidated results of operations.  
  As of December 31, 2015, the purchase accounting for Elster is subject to final adjustment primarily for the valuation of useful lives of intangible assets, amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, tax balances and for certain pre-acquisition contingencies.  
  In January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for approximately $240 million.  
  In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $330 million. COM DEV, a public company in Canada, operates globally
  and had reported 2015 revenues of approximately $180 million. COM DEV will be integrated into Aerospace.  
  In February 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies, for approximately $480 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter
  of 2016, pending regulatory approvals. Xtralis will be integrated into ACS.

  A summary of repositioning and other charges follows:  
 
  The following table summarizes the pretax distribution of total net repositioning and other charges by income statement classification:  
 
  The following table summarizes the pretax impact of total net repositioning and other charges by segment:  
 
  In 2015, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $216 million including severance costs of $197 million related to workforce reductions of 6,405 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in
  connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, mainly in Aerospace and ACS, were returned to income in 2015 due principally to higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in
  lower required severance payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.  
  In 2014, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $184 million including severance costs of $156 million related to workforce reductions of 2,975 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in
  connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, factory transitions in ACS and Aerospace to more cost-effective locations, and site consolidations and organizational realignments of businesses in ACS and PMT. Also, $38 million of previously established accruals, primarily for
  severance, mainly in Aerospace and ACS, were returned to income in 2014 due principally  
  41  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  to the change in scope of a previously announced repositioning action and higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments.  
  In 2013, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $231 million including severance costs of $186 million related to workforce reductions of 3,081 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in
  connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, achieving acquisition-related synergies in ACS, outsourcing of non-core components in Aerospace, the shutdown of a manufacturing facility in PMT, and factory transitions in ACS to more cost-effective locations. Also, $30 million of
  previously established accruals, primarily for severance, in ACS and PMT, were returned to income in 2013 due to changes in the scope of previously announced repositioning actions, lower than expected costs in completing the exit of a product line and higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance
  programs resulting in lower required severance payments.  
  The following table summarizes the status of our total repositioning reserves:  
 
  Certain repositioning projects in Aerospace, ACS and PMT in 2015, 2014 and 2013 included exit or disposal activities, the costs related to which will be recognized in future periods when the actual liability is incurred. Such exit and disposal costs were not significant.

Net of changes in valuation allowance  

The effective tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to decreased tax benefits from the resolution of tax audits, partially offset by increased tax benefits from manufacturing incentives, the impact of more income in jurisdictions with lower
  tax rates and fewer reserves. The Company s non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2015 was 19.5%, a decrease of approximately 1.8 percentage points compared to 2014. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions coupled
  with lower expense related to reserves in various jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase from the tax impact of restructuring and dispositions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.  
  The effective tax rate decreased by 1.2 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower tax expense from the resolution of audits, partially offset by the impact of more income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates and additional reserves. The Company s non-U.S.
  effective tax rate for 2014 was 21.3%, an increase of approximately 2.3 percentage points compared to 2013. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to additional reserves and the impact of more income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, partially offset by the tax impact of
  dispositions. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
   Deferred tax assets (liabilities)   
  The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows:  
 
  As described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company has presented deferred income taxes as noncurrent as of December 31, 2015.  
  The change in deferred tax balance was primarily attributable to deferred tax liabilities for intangible assets that were recorded in connection with the acquisition of Elster. Our gross deferred tax asset includes $1,049 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of deductible temporary
  differences and net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom). We maintain a valuation allowance of $587 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in an
  increase of $114 million, decrease of $10 million and increase of $49 million to income tax expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period
  such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.  
  As of December 31, 2015, our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows:  
 
  45  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In those instances whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward
  have been reduced.  
  U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the vast majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and non-U.S. withholding
  taxes on approximately $16.6 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S.
  income tax liability.  
 
  As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 there were $765 million, $659 million and $729 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would be recorded as a component of income tax expense.  
  Generally, our unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. The following table summarizes these open tax years by major jurisdiction as of December 31, 2015:  

(1)   

Includes provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable.  

Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as  
  46  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  liabilities in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods.  
  Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $349 million, $403 million and $431 million, as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of
  Operations and totaled $11 million, $24 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Accrued interest and penalties were $336 million, $325 million and $301 million, as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.  
   Note 6. Earnings Per Share   
  The details of the earnings per share calculations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:  

The diluted earnings per share calculations exclude the effect of stock options when the options  assumed proceeds exceed the average market price of the common shares during the period. In 2015, 2014, and 2013 the weighted number of stock options excluded from the computations were 7.1 million, 4.7
  million, and 2.2 million. These stock options were outstanding at the end of each of the respective periods.  
   Note 7. Accounts, Notes and Other Receivables   
 
  Trade Receivables includes $1,590 million and $1,636 million of unbilled balances under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. These amounts are billed in accordance with the terms of customer contracts to which they relate.

  The schedule of principal payments on long-term debt is as follows:  
 
  On July 10, 2015, the Company entered into a $4 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. Commitments under the Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5
  billion. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the previous $4 billion five year credit agreement with substantially the same material terms and conditions. A full description of the Credit Agreement can be found in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K, dated July 10, 2015.  
  On September 30, 2015, the Company entered into a $3 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes including the Elster acquisition. A full description of the 364-Day Credit Agreement
  can be found in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K, dated October 1, 2015.

  Rent expense was $390 million, $420 million and $404 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.  
   Note 14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures   
    Credit and Market Risk   Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum
  credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair
  value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.  
  We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a
  single customer or a small group of customers.  
    Foreign Currency Risk Management   We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated
  monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these
  opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts with third parties.  
  We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in
  Other (Income) Expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which predominantly occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange
  rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange forward contracts mature predominantly in
  the next twelve months. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had contracts with notional amounts of $10,538 million and $7,291 million to exchange foreign  
  51  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, U.A.E. Dirham and Singapore Dollar.  
  We have also designated foreign currency debt as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as
  foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2015.  
    Interest Rate Risk Management   We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December
  31, 2015 and 2014, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,100 million of fixed rate debt at rate of 4.00 to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2023.  
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The FASB s accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).  
  Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December
  31, 2015 and 2014:  
 
  The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial
  paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2.  
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were not
  carried at fair value:  
 
  The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt  
  52  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well.  
  Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $2 million
  in the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $38 million in the year ended 2014. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged.  
  We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets
  and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $86 million and $181 million of expense, in other (income) expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for further details of the net impact of these economic foreign currency hedges.  
   Note 15. Other Liabilities   
 
   Note 16. Capital Stock   
  We are authorized to issue up to 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $1. Common shareowners are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board, are entitled to one vote per share, and are entitled, in the event of liquidation, to share ratably in all the assets of
  Honeywell which are available for distribution to the common shareowners. Common shareowners do not have preemptive or conversion rights. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further calls or assessments. There are no restrictions on us relative to
  dividends or the repurchase or redemption of common stock.  
  In December 2013 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, $2.2 billion and $4.1 billion remained available as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 for additional share repurchases.  
  We purchased approximately 18.8 million and 10.0 million shares of our common stock in 2015 and 2014, for $1,884 million and $924 million.  
  We are authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December 31, 2015, there was no preferred stock outstanding.

Note 18. Stock-Based Compensation Plans   
  Under the terms of the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2011 Plan) there were 14,050,760 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants at December 31, 2015. Additionally, the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International
  Inc. (2006 Directors Plan) expires on April 24, 2016 and it is expected that no future grants will be made under the 2006 Directors Plan prior to expiration. In 2016, the Company is seeking shareowner approval of a new employee stock plan and non-employee director plan and, upon approval, no additional grants
  will be permitted under the 2011 Plan or the 2006 Directors Plan.  
    Stock Options   The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than
  the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.  
  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an
  expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield
  curve in effect at the time of grant.  
  Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $78 million, $85 million and $70 million. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $26 million, $31 million and $24
  million.

At December 31, 2015 there was $140 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.36 years. The total fair value of options vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $73 million, $72 million
  and $67 million.  
    Restricted Stock Units   Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued to certain key employees and directors at fair market value at the date of grant as compensation. RSUs typically become fully vested over
  periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting.

   Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies   
   Environmental Matters   
  We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and
  that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred
  remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to
  continue to arise in the future.  
  With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial
  efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts  
  59  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to
  develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and
  feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.  
  The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs:  
 
  Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts:  
 
  We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined
  although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
  position.  
    Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY   We are implementing a combined dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. We have accrued for our estimated cost of remediating Onondaga
  Lake based on currently available information and analysis performed by our engineering consultants. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting
  policy described above.  
  Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site. It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages.

   Asbestos Matters   
  Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to two predecessor companies:  

North American Refractories Company (NARCO), which was sold in 1986, produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications). Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting.   

Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of
      individuals who performed brake replacements.  

The following tables summarize information concerning NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances:  
   Asbestos Related Liabilities   
 
   Insurance Recoveries for Asbestos Related Liabilities   
 
  61  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances are included in the following balance sheet accounts:  
 
    NARCO Products   In connection with NARCO s emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2013, a federally authorized 524(g) trust (NARCO Trust) was established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent
  channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts
  in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In addition, Honeywell provided, and
  continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors  adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures.  
  Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in the years 2016 through 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter. However,
  the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court
  alleging breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures. The proceeding is ongoing. As of December 31, 2015, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims.  
  Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust
  Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date of the NARCO Trust). Such payments are not subject to the annual
  cap described above.  
  Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for pre-established unliquidated claims ($145 million), unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection ($33 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against
  the NARCO Trust through 2018 ($743 million). In the absence of actual trust experience on which to base the estimate, Honeywell projected the probable value of asbestos related future liabilities, including trust claim handling costs, based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy
  courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Some critical assumptions underlying this methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease
  instances. This projection resulted in a range of estimated  
  62  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections and in connection with the recent
  implementation of the Trust Distribution Procedures by the NARCO Trust, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCO s Chapter 11 case, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating NARCO asbestos claims beyond 2018.  
  Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance
  companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which
  has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.  
  Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded. Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant
  factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.  
    Friction Products   The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity:  

Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows:  
 
  It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future.  
  63  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We
  update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year.  
  The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease
  classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the
  next five years. The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims.  
  Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
  Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our
  historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers.  
  Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos
  claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over
  which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given,
  however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change.  
   Other Matters   
  We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee
  benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible
  losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following:  
    Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al   In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW seeking a
  declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. The UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a mirror suit in the Eastern  
  64  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Company s liability for healthcare coverage. The New Jersey action was dismissed and Honeywell subsequently answered the UAW s complaint in Michigan and asserted counterclaims for fraudulent inducement, negligent
  misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty. The UAW filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims. The court dismissed Honeywell s fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims, but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty. In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to
  stay the proceedings with respect to those retirees who retired before the initial inclusions of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA until the Supreme Court decided the  M G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett  case. In a ruling on January 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that retiree health insurance benefits provided in
  collective bargaining agreements do not carry an inference that they are vested or guaranteed to continue for life and that the  vesting  issue must be decided pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law. The stay of the proceedings has been lifted and the case is again proceeding in the normal course. Based
  on the Supreme Court s ruling, Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell s other
  postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $176 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.  
  In December 2013, the UAW and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to those retirees who retired after the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA. The UAW sought a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywell s obligation to contribute to healthcare
  coverage for the post-2003 retirees. That motion remains pending. Honeywell is confident that the Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywell s retiree healthcare obligation for post-2003 retirees. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell s other postretirement benefits for post-
  2003 retirees would increase by approximately $110 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.  
    Joint Strike Fighter Investigation   In 2013 the Company received subpoenas from the Department of Justice requesting information relating primarily to parts manufactured in the United Kingdom and China used in the F-35 fighter jet. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. While we believe
  that Honeywell has complied with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations regarding the manufacture of these sensors, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the investigation or what action, if any, may result from it.  
  Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past
  experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new
  developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized
  or paid.  
    Warranties and Guarantees    
  In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and
  guarantees are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable.

  The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees:  
 
  Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts:  
 
   Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits   
  We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits for substantially all U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and
  salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK,
  Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.  
  We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. Less than 1% of Honeywell s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company; and this subsidy is limited to a fixed-dollar amount. In addition,
  more than 80% of Honeywell s current retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our
  operating cash flow.

  The components of net periodic benefit (income) cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss for our significant pension and other postretirement benefit plans include the following components:  

The estimated prior service (credit) for pension benefits that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss into net periodic benefit (income) cost in 2016 are expected to be ($44) million and ($3) million for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.

69  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
 
  The estimated net loss and prior service (credit) for other postretirement benefits that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss into net periodic benefit (income) in 2016 are expected to be $22 million and ($76) million.  
  Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant benefit plans are presented in the following table as weighted averages.  

The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling
  process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the
  other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.  
  70  

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)     (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   
  During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant pension plans. Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the
  yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation. The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash
  flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change does not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and is applied prospectively as a change in estimate.  
  For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted-average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2016 are 4.69% and 3.59%. We estimate the service and interest costs for our U.S. pension plans will be reduced by approximately $150 million in 2016.  
  Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as
  appropriate.  
  For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. The impact of the discount rate methodology change on service and interest costs for our non-U.S. pension plans was not material.  
   Pension Benefits   
  Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows:  
 
  Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.9 billion and $17.2 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $6.2 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014.  
  Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-
  term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock
  of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate
  funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $2,613 million and
  $2,354 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $54 million and $65 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts.  
  Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using
  pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in commingled funds which are valued
  using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in
  real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals.  
  Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to
  make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2016. In 2015, contributions of $139 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2016, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $160 million to our non-U.S.
  pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareowners  equity for the year then ended. We also
  have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management s Report on Internal
  Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at the Elster Division of Melrose Industries Plc. ( Elster ), which was acquired on December 29, 2015 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 1.8% of consolidated total
  assets and a de minimis percentage of total consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Elster. The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
  over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on
  the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
  effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
  by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
  company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
  effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
  80  

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
  accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
  Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity and cash flows for each of two years in the period ended December 31, 2014 present fairly, in all material respects, the
  financial position of Honeywell International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
  financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure    
  Not Applicable.  
    Item 9A. Controls and Procedures    
  Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
  specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
  materially affect, Honeywell s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  
  Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2015. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our
  disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December 31, 2015.  
    Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
  Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywell s
  internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  
  Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control Integrated
  Framework (2013) . Management excluded the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), acquired on December 29, 2015, from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 Elster represented approximately 1.8% of our consolidated total assets
  and a de minimus percentage of our total consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.  
  The effectiveness of Honeywell s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Deloitte   Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
    Item 9B. Other Information    
  Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Honeywell is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with
  entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders.  
  A non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiary of Honeywell (the Non-U.S. Subsidiary) inadvertently made four ground shipments of low value, non-U.S. items from Turkey to Uzbekistan from December 2013 to  
  83  

March 2014 that transited through Iran en route to Uzbekistan on trucks operated by a third party transportation vendor (the Vendor) retained by the Non-U.S. Subsidiary. The Non-U.S. Subsidiary hired the Vendor to facilitate shipment and the Vendor further engaged a trucking company to provide surface
  transport. The Vendor proposed the transport route for the shipment. The shipment of the items via Iran occurred inadvertently as a result of non-U.S. person employees approving the transport route proposed by the Vendor. Honeywell disclosed these past transactions voluntarily to the U.S. Treasury
  Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  
  The Non-U.S. Subsidiary did not pay, directly or indirectly, any duties or taxes to the Government of Iran as a result of these shipments because the shipments were made under TIR (Transports Internationaux Routiers) Carnets, a treaty system which allows for the transport of merchandise through
  contracting parties from the customs office of departure to the customs office of destination without payment of customs duties/taxes in transiting countries. Further, the Non-U.S. Subsidiary made all payments for shipping services to the Vendor on a flat-fee basis at a rate of $11,800 per shipment, and the Non-
  U.S. Subsidiary did not reimburse the Vendor for any fees or other expenses incurred in Iran.  
  Neither Honeywell nor the Non-U.S. Subsidiary derived any revenue by inadvertently shipping the items via Iran.  
    Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant    
  Information relating to the Directors of Honeywell, as well as information relating to compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, will be contained in our definitive Proxy Statement involving the election of the Directors, which will be filed with the SEC pursuant to Regulation 14A not
