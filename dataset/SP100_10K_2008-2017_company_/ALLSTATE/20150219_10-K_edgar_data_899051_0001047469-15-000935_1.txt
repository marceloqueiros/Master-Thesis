Part I            

Item 1.  Business            

         The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries
(collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the property-liability insurance and life insurance business. It offers its products in the United
States and Canada.   

         The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate " slogan,
Allstate's strategy is to reinvent protection and retirement to help consumers protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Allstate is the 2 nd  largest personal
property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2013 statutory direct premiums earned according to A.M. Best. In addition, according to A.M. Best, it is the nation's
16 th  largest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2013 ordinary life insurance in force and 29 th  largest on the basis of 2013 statutory admitted
assets.   

Allstate
has four business segments:   

Allstate Protection  

Discontinued Lines and Coverages  

Allstate Financial  

Corporate and Other  

To
achieve its goals in 2015, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:  

grow insurance policies in force;           maintain the underlying combined ratio;           proactively manage investments to generate attractive risk adjusted returns;  
         modernize the operating model; and           build long-term growth platforms.    

         In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory
financial information to assess our competitive position.   

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT            

Products and Distribution     

         Total Allstate Protection premiums written were $29.61 billion in 2014. Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 93% of
Allstate's 2014 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this segment, we principally sell private passenger auto and homeowners insurance through agencies and directly through contact
centers and the internet. These products are underwritten under the Allstate , Esurance  and Encompass  brand names.   

            Our Unique Strategy      Consumer Segments                                         

1  

Table of Contents   

         Allstate
serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (local advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral versus
brand-sensitive).  

Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve customers who
prefer local personalized advice and service and are brand-sensitive. The Allstate brand also sells specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road vehicle insurance
policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial lines products for small business owners; roadside
assistance products; and service contracts and other products sold in conjunction with auto lending and vehicle sales transactions. Allstate brand sales and service are supported through contact
centers and the internet. In 2014, the Allstate brand represented 91% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. In the U.S., we offer these Allstate brand products through approximately
10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations with approximately 23,200 licensed sales professionals. We also offer these products through approximately 2,000 independent
agencies that are primarily in rural areas in the U.S. In Canada we offer Allstate brand products through approximately 750 employee producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario,
Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).           Esurance brand auto, homeowners, renter and motorcycle insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through contact
centers and through select agents, including Answer Financial. Esurance serves self-directed, brand-sensitive customers. In 2014, the Esurance brand represented 5% of the Allstate Protection segment's
written premium.           Encompass brand auto, homeowners, umbrella and other insurance products, sold predominantly in the form of a single annual household
("package") policy, are distributed through independent agencies that serve consumers who prefer personal advice and assistance from an independent adviser and are brand neutral. Encompass targets
approximately 35 million mass affluent households (consumers with $100,000 - $500,000 in household income and net worth greater than $150,000) in the U.S., with their higher average
premiums and preference for professional advice regarding coverage needs and risk solutions. In 2014, the Encompass brand represented 4% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. Encompass
brand products are distributed through approximately 2,400 independent agencies. Encompass is among the top 15 largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through
independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information provided by A.M. Best for 2013.           Answer Financial, an independent personal lines insurance
agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice
between insurance carriers. It offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 25 insurance companies through its website and over the phone and receives commissions for
this service.    

         Through
arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers, the Allstate Protection segment may offer non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not
available. As of December 31, 2014, Allstate agencies had approximately $1.3 billion of non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related to property
business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $160 million of
non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. Answer Financial had $526 million of non-proprietary premiums written in 2014.   

Competition     

         The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the
market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2013 according to A.M. Best.   

2  

Table of Contents   

         In
the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally using customer value propositions for each consumer segment. This includes different brands, the scope and
type of distribution system, price and the breadth of product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of
underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use sophisticated pricing algorithms to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base.   

         The
primary focus of our sophisticated pricing methods has been on acquiring and retaining profitable business. Sophisticated pricing and underwriting methods use a number of risk
evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years
insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance scoring utilizing certain credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but
are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history; age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring utilizing
certain credit report information.   

         Allstate
differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the needs of the entire household and offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features through
distribution channels that best suit each market segment. Allstate's Your Choice Auto  insurance allows qualified customers to choose from a variety of options, such as Accident
Forgiveness, Deductible Rewards , Safe Driving Bonus , and New Car Replacement. We believe that Your Choice Auto insurance promotes increased growth and increased retention. We
also offer a Claim Satisfaction Guarantee sm  feature that promises a return of premium to Allstate brand standard auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience.
Allstate House and Home  insurance is our homeowners product that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. Good
Hands  Roadside Assistance is a service that provides pay on demand access to roadside services.   

         Our
Allstate branded Drivewise  and Esurance DriveSense  offerings are usage-based insurance programs that use an in-car device or a mobile application to capture
driving behaviors and reward customers for driving safely. We are also testing additional features that extend the benefits of being connected beyond auto insurance pricing. The recently introduced
Star Driver  program encourages an ongoing conversation about safe driving through an easy-to-use application to develop teens' confidence behind the wheel. The Esurance
DriveSafe  program is designed to help parents coach teens on safe driving by providing customizable driving statistics and the ability to limit cell phone use while the car is in motion,
all controlled by a device installed in the vehicle.   

         The
Encompass package policy simplifies the insurance experience by packaging a product with broader coverage and higher limits into a single annual household policy with one premium,
one bill, one policy deductible and one renewal date.   

Geographic Markets     

         The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners, and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States.
Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell
personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada.   

         The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment for 2014, based on information contained in
statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the premiums earned for the segment.

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT            

Products and Distribution     

         Our Allstate Financial segment sells traditional, interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and voluntary accident and health
insurance products. We sell Allstate Financial products through Allstate exclusive agencies and approximately 1,170 exclusive financial specialists, and workplace enrolling independent agents. The
majority of life insurance business written involves exclusive financial specialists, including referrals from exclusive agencies and licensed sales professionals. The table below lists our current
distribution channels with the associated products and target customers.

disability insurance, and long-term care insurance. As of December 31, 2014, Allstate agencies had approximately $13.5 billion of non-proprietary mutual funds and fixed and variable
annuity account balances under management. New and additional deposits into these non-proprietary products were $1.9 billion in 2014.   

Competition     

         We compete on a wide variety of factors, including product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength and ratings, price,
distribution and the level of customer service. The market for life insurance continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2013, there were approximately 400 groups of
life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2013, the Allstate Financial segment is the
nation's 16 th  largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2013 ordinary life insurance in force and 29 th  largest on the basis of
2013 statutory admitted assets.   

Geographic Markets     

         We sell life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States. Through subsidiaries, we are
authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. Beginning in 2015, we also intend to sell voluntary
accident and health insurance in Canada.   

         The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for 2014, based on
information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations.

ALLSTATE EXCLUSIVE AGENCIES            

         Allstate exclusive agencies offer for sale products targeted to consumers that prefer local personalized advice and branded products
from both the Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial segments. They offer Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance policies; specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home
and off-road vehicle insurance policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial products for small
business owners; and roadside assistance products. Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists offer various life insurance products, as well as voluntary accident and health
insurance products. In addition, arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers allow Allstate exclusive agencies the ability to make available non-proprietary products to consumers

         In
the U.S., Allstate brand products are sold through approximately 10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations. In addition, these agencies employ approximately
23,200 licensed sales professionals who are licensed to sell our products. We also offer these products through approximately 2,000 independent agencies in primarily rural areas in the U.S. In Canada
we offer Allstate brand products through approximately 750 producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia). We pursue opportunities for
growing Allstate brand exclusive agency distribution based on market opportunities.   

         We
support our exclusive agencies in a variety of ways to facilitate customer service and Allstate's overall growth strategy. For example, we offer assistance with marketing, sales,
service and business processes and provide education and other resources to help them acquire more business and retain more customers. Our programs support exclusive agencies and help them grow by
offering financing to acquire other agencies and awarding additional resources to better performing agencies. We support our relationship with Allstate exclusive agencies through several national and
regional working groups:  

The Agency Executive Council, led by Allstate's senior leadership, engages exclusive agencies on our customer service and growth
strategy. Membership includes approximately 20 Allstate exclusive agency owners selected on the basis of performance, thought leadership and credibility among their peer group.           The
National Advisory Board brings together Allstate's senior leadership and a cross section of Allstate exclusive agents and
exclusive financial specialists from around the country to address national business issues and develop solutions.           Regional Advisory Boards support Allstate exclusive agency owner
engagement within each of Allstate's 15 regional offices in the U.S.
and within Canada.    

         The
compensation structure for Allstate exclusive agencies rewards agencies for delivering high value to our customers and achieving certain business outcomes such as product
profitability, net growth and household penetration. Allstate exclusive agent remuneration comprises a base commission (Property-Liability and Allstate Financial products), variable compensation and a
bonus. Variable compensation has two components: agency success factors (local presence, Allstate Financial insurance policies sold and licensed staff), which must be achieved in order to qualify for
the second component, and customer satisfaction. In addition, a bonus that is a percentage of premiums can be earned by agents who achieve a targeted loss ratio and a defined amount of Allstate
Financial sales. The bonus is earned by achieving a targeted percentage of multi-category households (customers with Allstate policies in at least two of the following product categories: vehicle,
personal property, or life and retirement) and increases in Allstate Protection (Allstate brand) and Allstate Financial policies in force. Other elements of exclusive agency compensation and support
include start-up agency bonuses, marketing support payments, technology and data allowances, regional promotions and recognition trips based on achievement. Allstate exclusive financial specialists
receive commissions for proprietary and non-proprietary sales and earn a bonus based on the volume of business produced. There are no significant changes to the compensation framework planned for
2015.

         Since
Allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance, all Allstate brand customers who purchase their policies directly through contact centers and the internet are
provided an Allstate agency relationship at the time of purchase.   

         To
better serve customers who prefer local and personalized advice we are undergoing a focused effort to position agents, licensed sales professionals and financial specialists to serve
customers as trusted advisors. This means they know customers and understand the unique needs of their households, help them assess the potential risks they face and provide personalized guidance on
how to protect what matters most to them. To ensure agencies have the resources, capacity and support needed to serve customers at this level, we have efforts underway to enhance agency capabilities
while simplifying and automating service processes to enable agencies to focus more time in an advisory role.   

Allstate
employs field sales leaders who are responsible for recruiting and retaining Allstate agents and helping them grow their business and profitability. The field sales leaders'
compensation is aligned with agency success and includes a bonus based on the level of agent remuneration described above and agency geographic footprint.   

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS            

         Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations. Note 19 of the
consolidated financial statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment over the last three
years.   

         Our
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from property-liability insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses
in run-off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is presented in this segment. Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements contains information for
the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection and our
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments. Note 19 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.   

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE            

         The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate
Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.   

Reconciliation of Claims Reserves     

         The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense
reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of

  Financial
Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

(1)     The
Esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in 2012 resulting in a reduction in reserves due to lower severity. The
adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio.      (2)
     In
2014, 2013 and 2012, the gross change in provision attributable to prior years, primarily relate to increases for Michigan and New Jersey
unlimited personal injury protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves (see the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section for additional discussion).      (3)     In
2013, the net change in provision attributable to prior years decreased $544 million compared to 2012, primarily due to lower
catastrophe reserve reestimates.       (4)     Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $5.69 billion, $4.66 billion and $4.01 billion as of
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.    

The
year-end 2014 gross reserves of $22.92 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $7.00 billion more than the
net reserve balance of $15.93 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance
recoverables from third parties totaling $5.69 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the
Canadian subsidiaries for $1.14 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.

Table of Contents    

         As the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2013 decreased in 2014 by
$84 million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $925 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were more favorable than the gross reserve
reestimates due to reinsurance cessions.   

Loss Reserve Reestimates     

         The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect
to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's
expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and
indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation
period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable.   

The
Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the
current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

Table of Contents   

As
shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general, reflect additions to reserves in the
Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced by Allstate Protection, as discussed
more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years attributable to a reallocation of
reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to older years along with reserve strengthening
as discussed below.   

         The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year
period ended December 31, 2014. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are
applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve reestimates are shown in
this table in parentheses. The changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing
suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.   

In
2014, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was better than expected. The increased reserves in accident years 2004  
prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.   

         In
2013, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2003   prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment and a reclassification of injury reserves to older years.   

         In
2012, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates. The
increased reserves in accident years 2002   prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.   

         In
2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2001   prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.   

         In
2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000   prior is due to litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of
injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.   

  9  

Table of Contents   

         In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008 non-injury
reserves to older years.   

         In
2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates.   

         In
2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages
segment.   

         In
2006 and 2005, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was
anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in 2006, also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than
offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

additional information regarding reserves, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Property-Liability Claims and Claims
Expense Reserves."   

REGULATION            

         Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These
rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster
licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of
dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory
financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.
Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.   

         In
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. As part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank") was enacted in 2010. Some regulations required pursuant to this law must still be finalized, and we cannot predict what the
final regulations will require but do not expect a material impact on Allstate's operations. Dodd-Frank also created the Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") within the Treasury Department. The FIO
monitors the insurance industry, provides advice to the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC"), represents the U.S. on international insurance matters, and studies the current regulatory
system. FIO submitted reports to Congress in 2013 and 2014 addressing how to improve and modernize the system of insurance regulation. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue
to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the
regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. We are working for changes in the regulatory environment, including recognizing the need for better catastrophe
preparedness and loss mitigation, improving appropriate risk-based pricing, and promoting ways to make regulation more uniform and consistent across the country.   

         Additional
regulations or new requirements may emerge from activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ("IAIS"), that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. In addition, the
NAIC has proposed amendments to their model holding company law, which has not yet been adopted by any jurisdiction. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an
increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies.   

Agent and Broker Compensation.       In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents
and
brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. Agents and brokers in New York
are required to disclose certain information concerning compensation.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.       As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt.
Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see
Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in
some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.   

          Insurance Holding Company Regulation   Change of Control.       The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance
holding companies subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of California,
Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin, and some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in California and Florida. Generally, the insurance codes in
these states provide that the acquisition or change of "control" of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior
approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to,
ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person that controls an insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of
a change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to
disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non-domestic insurer if certain conditions exist,
such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation's common stock would generally require prior approval by the
state insurance departments in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of
five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to
transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay, or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation's common stock.   

           Rate Regulation.       Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.   

         The
speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval,
(ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws,
the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to
file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the
regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.   

         An
insurer's ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or
proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer
can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a rate that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.   

         From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure, particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss
costs from high levels of catastrophe losses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models that are being
reviewed by regulators and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of
possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rating.

           Involuntary Markets.       As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.   

           Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association.       The Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA") is a mandatory insurance coverage and
reinsurance
indemnification mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year. It operates similar to a
reinsurance program and is funded by participating companies through a per vehicle annual assessment that is currently $186. This assessment is included in the premiums we charge our customers and
when collected, we remit the assessment to the MCCA. The participating company retention level is $530 thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2015, and June 30,
2014. The MCCA provides unlimited lifetime medical benefits for
qualifying injuries from automobile and motorcycle accidents. Many of these injuries are catastrophic in nature, resulting in serious permanent disabilities that require attendant and residential care
for periods that may span decades. The MCCA may not be funded on an actuarial basis and can accumulate unfunded claims liabilities. As required for a member company, we report covered paid and unpaid
claims to the MCCA, when estimates of loss for a reported claim are expected to exceed the retention level. The MCCA reimburses members as qualifying claims are paid and billed by members to the MCCA.
Because of the nature of the coverage, losses (the most significant of which are for residential and attendant care) may be paid over the lifetime of a claimant, and accordingly, significant levels of
incurred claims reserves are recorded by member companies as well as offsetting reinsurance recoverables. The MCCA currently has unfunded claims liabilities with an obligation to indemnify its
members. The MCCA's future operation and form are dependent upon the continuation of enabling state legislation. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on
Allstate.   

          New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund.       The New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund ("NJUCJF") provides compensation to
qualified
claimants for bodily injury or death caused by private passenger automobiles operated by uninsured or "hit and run" drivers. The fund also provides reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits
portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in excess of $75,000 with no limits for policies issued or renewed prior to January 1, 1991 and in excess of $75,000 and capped at $250,000
for policies issued or renewed from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2004. NJUCJF expenses are assessed on companies writing motor vehicle liability insurance in New Jersey annually based
on their private passenger and commercial automobile written premiums. The NJUCJF was merged into the New Jersey Property Liability Guaranty Association who collects the assessments. We do not
anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on Allstate.   

           Guaranty Funds.       Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.   

           National Flood Insurance Program.       We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").
The NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the
Standard Flood Insurance Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States
Treasury. We receive expense allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management and commissions and are reimbursed for adjuster fees. The federal government is obligated to
pay all claims that fall under the arrangement.   

           Investment Regulation.       Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus.
Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.   

           Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.       Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a
market. For example, states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of
insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans
to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.   

           Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.       The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the   

  12  

Table of Contents   

  federal
and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").   

           Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.       The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators.   

Privacy Regulation.       Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and
confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities
are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.   

Asbestos.       Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but sufficient support among various
defendant
and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.   

           Environmental.       Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The
Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration of waste sites by Potentially
Responsible Parties ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or
"ECLs") establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of
factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of assigning liability
remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties' alleged
liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund
response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies; trigger of coverage; the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions; proper notice of claims; whether
administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an
"occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate's exposure to
liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform
measures have been enacted.

subject to certain risks or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but
are not limited to, those described in Part 1, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report and those described from time to time in our other reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.    

Item 1A.  Risk Factors            

         In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which
apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other products and financial services. These cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this
document, in our filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference.   

Risks Relating to the Property-Liability business     

As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe
weather events     

         Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, Allstate Protection's operating results and
financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made events, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires,
tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tropical storms and certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of:
(1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) loss estimates from external
hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on our operating results
and financial condition. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 totaling $3.6 billion, the Northridge earthquake of 1994
totaling $2.1 billion and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 totaling $2.3 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the California Earthquake Authority and various state-created insurance
facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Although we have historically financed the settlement of catastrophes from operating cash flows, including very
large catastrophes that had complicated issues resulting in settlement delays, our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a
downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings.   

         In
addition, we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely
unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur.   

The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our
operating results and financial condition     

         Along with others in the insurance industry, Allstate Protection uses models developed by third party vendors as well as our own
historic data in assessing our property insurance exposure to catastrophe losses. These models assume various conditions and probability scenarios. Such models do not necessarily accurately predict
future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred. Catastrophe models, which have been evolving since the early 1990s, use historical information and scientific research about hurricanes
and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in-force business. While we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities, there are limitations
with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period as actual catastrophic events vary considerably. Other limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates
between models, material increases and decreases in results due to model changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and actual conditions that are not yet well understood or may not be
properly incorporated into the models.   

Impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth     

         Due to Allstate Protection's catastrophe risk management efforts, the size of our homeowners business has been negatively impacted and
may be negatively impacted if we take further actions. Homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be adversely impacted by adjustments to our business structure, size and underwriting
practices in   

  15  

Table of Contents   

  markets
with significant severe weather and catastrophe risk exposure. In addition, due to the diminished potential for cross-selling opportunities that cannot be fully replaced by brokering
arrangements that allow our agents to write property products with other carriers, new business growth in our auto lines has been and could be lower than expected.   

A regulatory environment that limits rate increases and requires us to underwrite business and
participate in loss sharing arrangements may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition     

         From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may
not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. For example, if Allstate Protection's loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry, state or provincial regulatory authorities may
impose rate rollbacks, require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders, or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing
regulatory resistance to rate increases. Such resistance affects our ability, in all product lines, to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability
and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost.   

         In
addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property-liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans,
reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise
charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity, or as the facilities
recognize a financial deficit, they may in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers, adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations of many
states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Additionally, certain
states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the
state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors.   

The potential benefits of our sophisticated risk segmentation process may not be fully realized     

         We believe that our sophisticated pricing and underwriting methods (which, in some situations, considers information that is obtained
from credit reports and other factors) has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, because many of our competitors seek to adopt underwriting criteria and sophisticated
pricing models similar to those we use, our competitive advantage could decline or be lost. Further, the use of increasingly sophisticated pricing models is being reviewed by regulators and special
interest groups. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our sophisticated pricing models. Furthermore, we cannot be assured that these sophisticated pricing models will accurately reflect
the level of losses that we will ultimately incur.   

Changes in the level of price competition and the use of underwriting standards in the property and
casualty business may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition     

         The property and casualty market has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive
underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A
downturn in the profitability of the property and casualty business could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition.   

Unexpected increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating
results and financial condition     

         Unexpected changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment. Changes in
bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in
auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, building materials and home furnishings, changes in
the mix of loss type, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. However, changes in the level of the
severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are
inherently difficult to predict. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives in the Allstate Protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no
assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity.   

  16  

Table of Contents   

         Our
Allstate Protection segment may experience volatility in claim frequency from time to time, and short-term trends may not continue over the longer term. A significant increase in
claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.   

Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect
our operating results and financial condition     

         Recorded claim reserves in the Property-Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and incurred but
not reported claims reserves ("IBNR"), after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims
paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms. External factors are also considered, such as
court decisions; changes in law; litigation imposing unintended coverage and benefits such as disallowing the use of benefit payment schedules, requiring coverage designed to cover losses that occur
in a single policy period to losses that develop continuously over multiple policy periods or requiring the availability of multiple limits; regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because
reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently
uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.   

Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines is
inherently uncertain and may have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition     

         The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues
concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and whether losses could be recoverable
through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos-related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigation are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve
substantial uncertainty for insurers. Actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators
of the extent of probable loss. Ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material effect on our operating
results and financial condition.   

Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment     

Changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability and financial
condition     

         Our product pricing includes long-term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs
and expenses of the business. We establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that we must hold to support in-force contracts taking into
account rating agencies and regulatory requirements. We monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target new business returns on a portfolio basis, which could result in the
discontinuation or de-emphasis of products and a decline in sales. Profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to
variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions. Additionally, many of our products have fixed or guaranteed terms that limit our ability to increase revenues or reduce benefits,
including credited interest, once the product has been issued.   

         Our
profitability in this segment depends on the sufficiency of premiums and contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits, the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of
acquisition expenses, the adequacy of investment spreads, the management of market and credit risks associated with investments, and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated
pricing allowances. Legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability and financial condition.   

Changes in reserve estimates may adversely affect our operating results     

         The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits payable under insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
life-contingent immediate annuities and voluntary accident and health insurance products, is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity,
persistency and expenses. We periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions, adjustments to reserves and
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") may be required that could have a material effect on our operating results.   

  17  

Table of Contents   

Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the profitability of
spread-based products     

         Our ability to manage the in-force Allstate Financial spread-based products, such as fixed annuities, is dependent upon maintaining
profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates. When market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels, proceeds from investments that have matured or have
been prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment spread. Lowering interest crediting rates on some products in such an environment can partially offset decreases in
investment
yield. However, these changes could be limited by regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in investment
yields. Increases in market interest rates can have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers, which can lead to
increased surrenders at a time when the segment's fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. This could lead to the sale of fixed income securities
at a loss. In addition, changes in market interest rates impact the valuation of derivatives embedded in equity-indexed annuity contracts that are not hedged, which could lead to volatility in net
income.   

Changes in estimates of profitability on interest-sensitive life products may adversely affect our
profitability and financial condition through the amortization of DAC     

         DAC related to interest-sensitive life contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future
gross profits ("EGP") over the estimated lives of the contracts. The principal assumptions for determining the amount of EGP are mortality, persistency, expenses, investment returns, including capital
gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of any hedges. Updates to these assumptions (commonly referred to as "DAC
unlocking") could result in accelerated amortization of DAC and thereby adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.   

Reducing our concentration in spread-based business and exiting certain distribution channels may
adversely affect reported results     

         We have been reducing our concentration in spread-based business and discontinued offering fixed annuities effective January 1,
2014. We also exited the independent master brokerage agencies and structured settlement annuity brokers distribution channels in 2013 and sold Lincoln Benefit Life Company ("LBL") on April 1,
2014. The reduction in sales of these products has and may continue to reduce investment portfolio levels. It may also complicate settlement of contract benefits including forced sales of assets with
unrealized capital losses, and affect goodwill impairment testing and insurance reserves deficiency testing. We plan to outsource the administration of our annuity business to a third party
administration company in 2015 following the successful transition of the servicing of the LBL business that was sold. If our efforts are unsuccessful, our cost structure may be less competitive.   

Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products and adversely affect our
financial condition     

         Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products we offer, primarily life insurance, receive favorable tax treatment.
This favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress and various state legislatures from time to time consider legislation that would
reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance. Congress and various state legislatures also consider proposals to reduce the taxation of certain
products or investments that may compete with life insurance. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or
create a disadvantage for
certain of our products making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material effect on our profitability and financial condition or ability to sell such products and could
result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate
planning.   

We may not be able to mitigate the capital impact associated with statutory reserving requirements,
potentially resulting in a need to increase prices, reduce sales of term or universal life products, and/or a return on equity below original levels assumed in pricing     

         To support statutory reserves for certain term and universal life insurance products with secondary guarantees, we currently utilize
reinsurance and capital markets solutions for financing a portion of our statutory reserve requirements deemed to be non-economic. As we continue to underwrite term and universal life business, we
expect to have additional financing needs to mitigate the impact of these reserve requirements. If we do not obtain additional financing as a result of market conditions or otherwise, this could
require us to increase prices, reduce our sales of term or universal life products, and/or result in a return on equity below original levels assumed in pricing.

Table of Contents   

Dispositions and acquisitions of businesses may adversely affect our results of operations including
the ability to continue sales by Allstate exclusive agents and receive adequate compensation for transition services     

         We are exposed to risks associated with disposed former affiliates when continuing relationships are maintained such as distribution
rights, reinsurance of new and in-force business, transition services and other contingent liabilities. We may be adversely impacted by declines in financial strength ratings of disposed former
affiliates due to rating agencies viewing the financial capacity of the former affiliate differently. Other compliance and operational issues may emerge involving agents, products, pricing, servicing
and claims related to the business reinsured from the former affiliate to the Company. In addition, during a transition period when the Company may be providing transition services, we may not be
receiving adequate compensation and could be judged as not providing service as contracted. These risks may adversely affect our results of operations.   

Risks Relating to Investments     

We are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality which may adversely affect investment
income and cause realized and unrealized losses     

         Although we continually reevaluate our investment management strategies, we remain subject to the risk that we will incur losses due to
adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates. Adverse changes in these rates, spreads and prices may occur due to changes in monetary policy and the
economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, investor return expectations and/or risk tolerance, insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants, or changes in
market perceptions of credit worthiness. We are also subject to market risk related to investments in real estate, loans and securities collateralized by real estate. Some of our investment strategies
target individual investments with unique risks that are not highly correlated with broad market risks. Although we expect these investments to increase total portfolio returns over time, their
performance may vary from and under-perform relative to the market in some periods.   

         We
are subject to risks associated with potential declines in credit quality related to specific issuers or specific industries and a general weakening in the economy, which are
typically reflected through credit spreads. Credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities and loans above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury
securities) that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity and/or prepayment risks. Credit spreads vary (i.e. increase or decrease) in response to the
market's perception of risk and liquidity in a specific issuer or specific sector and are influenced by the credit ratings, and the reliability of those ratings, published by external rating agencies.
Although we have the ability to use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks, the effectiveness of such instruments varies with liquidity and other conditions that may impact derivative
and bond markets. Adverse economic conditions or other factors could cause declines in the quality and valuation of our investment portfolio that could result in realized and unrealized losses. The
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular issuer, industry, collateral type, group of related industries, geographic sector or risk type could have an adverse effect on our
investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition.   

         A
decline in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may earn less than the portfolio's
average yield. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. A decline could also lead us to
purchase longer-term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. Alternatively, longer-term assets may be
sold and reinvested in shorter-term assets in anticipation of rising interest rates. An increase in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment
portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio. Declining equity markets could also cause the investments in
our pension plans to decrease and decreasing interest rates could cause the funding target and the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other
postretirement benefit plans to increase, either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans and a reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of
shareholders' equity, increases in pension and other postretirement benefit expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans.   

The determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments of our
investments is subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition     

         The determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our
ongoing evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes
available. We update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other-than-temporary impairments in our results of operations.   

  19  

Table of Contents   

  The
assessment of whether other-than-temporary impairments have occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Our conclusions on such
assessments are judgmental and include assumptions and projections of future cash flows and price recovery which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and circumstances change.
Furthermore, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments and additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future.   

The determination of the fair value of our fixed income and equity securities is subjective and
could materially impact our operating results and financial condition     

         In determining fair values we principally use the market approach which utilizes market transaction data for the same or similar
instruments. The degree of judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information. The fair value of assets may differ from the actual
amount received upon sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Moreover, the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on
the assets' fair values. The difference between amortized cost or cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, certain life and annuity DAC, certain deferred sales inducement costs, and certain
reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Changing market conditions could materially affect the
determination of the fair value of securities and unrealized net capital gains and losses could vary significantly.   

Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry     

Our future growth and profitability are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in
an insurance industry that is highly competitive     

         The insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our primary insurance competitors have well-established national reputations and
market similar products.   

         We
have invested in growth strategies by acting on our customer value propositions for each of our brands, through our differentiated product offerings and our distinctive advertising
campaigns. If we are unsuccessful in generating new business and retaining a sufficient number of our customers, our ability to increase premiums written could be impacted. In addition, if we
experience unexpected increases in our underlying costs (such as the frequency or severity of claims costs) generated by our new business, it could result in decreases in our profitability and lead to
price increases which could impair our ability to compete effectively for insurance business.   

We
are also investing in telematics and broadening the value proposition for the connected consumer. If we are not effective in anticipating the impact on our business of changing
technology, including automotive technology, our ability to successfully operate may be impaired.   

         Because
of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive
pressures will not have a material effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. This includes competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents and their licensed
sales professionals. In the event we are unable to attract and retain these producers or they are unable to attract and retain customers for our products, growth and retention could be materially
affected. Furthermore, certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore may have dissimilar profitability and return targets. Additionally, many of our voluntary
benefits products are underwritten annually. There is a risk that employers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors than they could by renewing coverage with us. These competitive
pressures may adversely affect the persistency of these products, as well as our ability to sell our products in the future.   

         Our
ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in developing the talent and skills of our human resources, attracting and assimilating new executive
talent into our organization, or deploying human resource talent consistently with our business goals.   

Difficult conditions in the global economy and capital markets generally could adversely affect our
business and operating results and these conditions may not improve in the near future     

         As with most businesses, we believe difficult conditions in the global economy and capital markets, such as significant negative
macroeconomic trends, including relatively high and sustained unemployment, reduced consumer spending, lower residential and commercial real estate prices, substantial increases in delinquencies on
consumer debt, including defaults on home mortgages, and the relatively low availability of credit could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.   

  20  

Table of Contents   

         Stressed
conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets or financial asset classes could adversely affect our investment portfolio. Disruptions in
one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Although the disruption in the global financial markets has moderated, not all global financial markets are functioning
normally, and the rate of recovery from the U.S. recession has been below historic averages. Several governments around the world have announced austerity actions to address their budget deficits that
may lead to a decline in economic activity.   

         In
the years since the financial crisis, the central banks of most developed countries have pursued fairly similar, and highly accommodative, monetary policies. While European policy
makers have developed mechanisms to address funding concerns, risks to the European economy and financial markets remain. Additionally, monetary policies among major central banks have begun to
diverge. The United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England continue to evaluate the timing and pace of normalizing their respective policies. In contrast, the European Central Bank has
recently launched a quantitative easing program and several central banks have lowered their benchmark interest rates to stimulate economic activity. The diverging policies are likely to result in
higher volatility and less certainty in capital markets.   

         General
economic conditions could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure investment results. Consumer behavior changes could include decreased demand for our
products. For example, if consumers purchase fewer automobiles, our sales of auto insurance may decline. Also, if consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose lower levels of auto and
homeowners insurance. In addition, holders of some of our interest-sensitive life insurance and annuity products may engage in an elevated level of discretionary withdrawals of contractholder funds.
Our investment results could be adversely affected as deteriorating financial and business conditions affect the issuers of the securities in our investment portfolio.   

Losses from legal and regulatory actions may be material to our operating results, cash flows and
financial condition     

         As is typical for a large company, we are involved in various legal actions, including class action litigation challenging a range of
company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. We are also involved in various regulatory actions and
inquiries, including market conduct exams by state insurance regulatory agencies. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of
amounts currently accrued and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition. The aggregate estimate of the range of
reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if any, disclosed in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Actual results may
vary significantly from the current estimate.   

We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our
operating costs and limit our growth     

         As insurance companies, broker-dealers, investment advisers and/or investment companies, many of our subsidiaries are subject to
extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Changes may sometimes lead to additional expenses, increased legal exposure, and additional limits on our
ability to grow or to achieve targeted profitability. Moreover, laws and regulations are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, each of which exercises a degree
of interpretive latitude, including state insurance regulators; state securities administrators; state attorneys general and federal agencies including the SEC, the FINRA and the U.S. Department of
Justice. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's
interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal
issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue
changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our
ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency
rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of
securities, which is generally the jurisdiction of the SEC, issued by The Allstate Corporation. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability
of our business.

Regulatory reforms, and the more stringent application of existing regulations, may make it more
expensive for us to conduct our business     

         The federal government has enacted comprehensive regulatory reforms for financial services entities. As part of a larger effort to
strengthen the regulation of the financial services market, certain reforms are applicable to the insurance industry, including the FIO established within the Treasury Department.   

         In
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny, members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance
companies, and the FIO and FSOC were established. In the future, if the FSOC were to determine that Allstate is a "systemically important" nonbank financial company, Allstate would be subject to
regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance and financial
regulation.   

         These
regulatory reforms and any additional legislative change or regulatory requirements imposed upon us in connection with the federal government's regulatory reform of the financial
services industry or arising from reform related to the international regulatory capital framework for financial services firms, and any more stringent enforcement of existing regulations by federal
authorities, may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business, or limit our ability to grow or to achieve profitability.   

Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write
new business     

         Our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to
catastrophes nationwide. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously
available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as is currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be
dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in future years.
If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to
either accept an increase in our catastrophe exposure, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives.   

Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us
against losses arising from ceded insurance, which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition     

         The collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market
conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments
under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. We also have credit risk exposure associated with the MCCA, a mandatory insurance coverage and reinsurance indemnification mechanism for personal
injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year, which is operating with a deficit, and the NJUCJF that provides
reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in excess of certain levels. Our reinsurance recoverable from the MCCA and NJUCJF was
$4.42 billion and $508 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material effect on our operating
results and financial condition.   

A downgrade in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive
position, the marketability of our product offerings, our liquidity, access to and cost of borrowing, operating results and financial condition     

         Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an
effect on an insurance company's business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review our financial performance and condition and could downgrade or change the outlook on our ratings due to, for
example, a change in one of our insurance company's statutory capital; a change in a
rating agency's determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; an increase in the perceived risk of our investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in
management or our business strategy; as well as a number of other considerations that may or may not be under our control. The insurance financial strength ratings of Allstate Insurance Company and
Allstate Life Insurance Company and The Allstate Corporation's senior debt ratings from A.M. Best, Standard   Poor's and Moody's are subject to continuous review, and the retention of
current ratings cannot be assured. A downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material effect on our sales, our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings, our liquidity, access
to and cost of borrowing, operating results and financial condition.

Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity
needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms     

         In periods of extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, liquidity and credit capacity may be severely
restricted. In such circumstances, our ability to obtain capital to fund operating expenses, financing costs, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited, and the cost of any such capital may
be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our
industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as lenders' perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory
authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case, we
may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms.   

The failure in cyber or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events
unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, additional costs and
impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively     

         We depend heavily upon computer systems and mathematical algorithms and data to perform necessary business functions. Despite our
implementation of a variety of security measures, our computer systems could be subject to cyber-attacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering.
Like other global companies, we have experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. Events such as
these could jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information (including personal information of our customers, claimants or employees) processed and stored in, and transmitted through,
our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs,
regulatory penalties and/or customer dissatisfaction or loss. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to expand our internet and mobile strategies, develop additional remote connectivity
solutions to serve our customers, and build and maintain an integrated digital enterprise.   

         The
occurrence of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, terrorist attack, war, cyber-attack, computer virus, insider threat, unanticipated
problems with our disaster recovery systems, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and
financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems or destroy data. If a significant number of our managers were
unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised.   

         Third
parties to whom we outsource certain of our functions are also subject to the risks outlined above. The Company also has business process and information technology operations in
Northern Ireland and India and is subject to operating, regulatory and political risks in those countries. Any of these may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences,
including a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.   

A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism or military actions may have an adverse
effect on the level of claim losses we incur, the value of our investment portfolio, our competitive position, marketability of product offerings, liquidity and operating results     

         A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism, within the United States and abroad, or military and other actions, and
heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and losses in our investment portfolio from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate
changes in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio
may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by a large scale pandemic or the continued threat of terrorism. Additionally, a large scale pandemic or
terrorist act could have a material effect on the sales, profitability, competitiveness, marketability of product offerings, liquidity, and operating results.   

We may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill, which may adversely affect
our operating results and financial condition     

         Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is
evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the   

  23  

Table of Contents   

  carrying
value (attributed equity) of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Market declines or other events impacting the fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment,
resulting in a charge to income. Such a charge could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.   

Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other
standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition     

         Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised,
interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions, which may have a
material effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected. For a description of changes in accounting standards that are
currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.   

The realization of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty     

         The realization of our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, if any, is based on our assumption that we will be able to
fully utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes. However, actual results may differ from our assumptions if adequate levels of taxable income are not attained.   

The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our
obligations     

         The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries.
State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. The limitations are based on
statutory income and surplus. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory
requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect holding company liquidity, including
our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service our debt, or complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected.   

         Management
views enterprise economic capital as a combination of statutory surplus and invested assets at the parent holding company level. Deterioration in statutory surplus or
earnings, from developments such as catastrophe losses, or changes in market conditions or interest rates, could adversely affect holding company
liquidity by impacting the amount of dividends from our subsidiaries or the utilization of invested assets at the holding company to increase statutory surplus or for other corporate purposes.   

Our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock is subject to limitations under terms of
certain of our securities     

         Subject to certain limited exceptions, during any dividend period while our preferred stock is outstanding, unless the full preferred
stock dividends for the preceding dividend period have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside and any declared but unpaid preferred stock
dividends for any prior period have been paid, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock. If and when dividends on our preferred stock have not been declared and paid in full for at
least six quarterly dividend periods, the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will be increased by two additional directors, to be elected by the holders of our
preferred stock together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of voting parity stock, voting as a single class, subject to certain conditions.   

         We
are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy, net income or shareholders' equity levels. The prohibition is
subject to an exception permitting us to declare dividends out of the net proceeds of common stock issued by us during the 90 days prior to the date of declaration even if we fail to meet such
levels.   

         The
terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing,
acquiring, or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.   

Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash
flows     

         Climate change, to the extent it produces changes in weather patterns, could affect the frequency or severity of weather events and
wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, and the results for our Allstate Protection segment.

Loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect our data or personal information
of our customers, claimants or employees could affect our operations     

         We rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of
computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services, human resource benefits management services and investment management services. In the event that one or more
of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect our data or personal information of our customers, claimants or
employees, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses.   

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims     

         We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our
intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to
litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property and to determine its scope, validity or enforceability, which could divert significant resources and prove unsuccessful. An inability to
protect our intellectual property could have a material effect on our business.   

         We
may be subject to claims by third parties for patent, trademark or copyright infringement or breach of usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in
significant expense and liability. If our third party providers or we are found to have infringed a third-party intellectual property right, either of us could be enjoined from providing certain
products or services or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly
licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly work around. Any of these scenarios could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.

Our home office complex is owned and located in Northbrook, Illinois. As of December 31, 2014, the home office complex consists
of several buildings totaling 2.3 million square feet of office space on a 282-acre site.   

         We
also operate from approximately 1,270 administrative, data processing, claims handling and other support facilities in North America. In addition to our home office facilities,
1.3 million square feet are owned and 6.8 million square feet are leased. Outside North America, we lease three properties in Northern Ireland comprising 166,460 square feet. We also
have one lease in India for 99,260 square feet and one lease in London for 1,390 square feet. Generally, only major Allstate facilities are owned. In a majority of cases, new lease terms and renewals
are for five years or less.   

         The
locations out of which the Allstate exclusive agencies operate in the U.S. are normally leased by the agencies as lessees.

Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities            

         As of January 30, 2015, there were 88,524 holders of record of The Allstate Corporation's common stock. The principal market for
the common stock is the New York Stock Exchange but it is
also listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Set forth below are the high and low New York Stock Exchange Composite listing prices of, and cash dividends declared for, the common stock during 2014 and
2013.   

The
payment of dividends by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation is limited by Illinois insurance law to formula amounts based on statutory net income and
statutory surplus, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. In the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2014, AIC paid dividends of
$2.47 billion. Based on the greater of 2014 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that AIC will be able to pay without prior Illinois Department of
Insurance approval at a given point in time in 2015 is $2.31 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. Notification and approval of
intercompany lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.   

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities     

(1)     In
accordance with the terms of its equity compensation plans, Allstate acquired the following shares in connection with stock option
exercises by employees and/or directors. The stock was received in payment of the exercise price of the options and in satisfaction of withholding taxes due upon exercise or vesting.   

October:        2,716 
    November:    453,605 
    December:    821   

    (2)     On August 1, 2014, Allstate entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Agreement")
with Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") to purchase $750 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. Morgan Stanley agreed to purchase the shares in the
market within a timeframe not to exceed four and one half months. In exchange for an upfront payment of $637.5 million, Morgan Stanley initially delivered 10,964,913 shares to Allstate.
Upon final settlement of the ASR Agreement in December 2014, Allstate received an additional 1,017,469 shares from Morgan Stanley for which it paid $112.5 million, which was determined
based generally on a discount to the volume-weighted average price per share of Allstate's common stock during the purchase period. This brought the total number of shares acquired under the ASR
Agreement to 11,982,382 shares, with the average purchase price equal to $62.5919 per share.
       (3)     From time to time, repurchases under our programs are executed under the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the
requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
       (4)     On
February 19, 2014, we announced the approval of a share repurchase program for $2.50 billion, to be completed by
August 31, 2015.

of December 31, 2013, $11.98 billion of investments and $12.84 billion of reserves for life-contingent contract
benefits and contractholder funds were classified as held for sale relating to the pending sale of Lincoln Benefit Life Company (see Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements).
       (2)     We
use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property-Liability results. We believe that they enhance an investor's
understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as follows: Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the
impact of catastrophe losses. Expense ratio is the ratio of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, operating costs and expenses, and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
Combined ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, operating costs and expenses, and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned, or underwriting
margin.

Table of Contents    

OVERVIEW     

         The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of
The Allstate Corporation (referred to in this document as "we," "our," "us," the "Company" or "Allstate"). It should be read in conjunction with the 5-year summary of selected financial data,
consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Part II. Item 6. and Item 8. contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in the
Property-Liability Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in the Allstate Financial Segment sections of Management's Discussion and
Analysis ("MD A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources. Resources are allocated
by the chief operating decision maker and performance is assessed for Allstate Protection, Discontinued Lines and Coverages and Allstate Financial. Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial
performance and resources are managed by committees of senior officers of the respective segments.   

         Allstate
is focused on the following priorities in 2015:  

grow insurance policies in force;           maintain the underlying combined ratio;           proactively manage investments to generate attractive risk adjusted returns;           modernize the operating model; and        
   build long-term growth platforms.    

The
most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include:  

For Allstate Protection: premium, the number of policies in force ("PIF"), new business sales, retention, price changes, claim
frequency (rate of claim occurrence per policy in force) and severity (average cost per claim), catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses, underwriting results, and relative competitive position.           For Allstate Financial: benefit and investment spread, asset-liability matching, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs
("DAC"), expenses, operating income, net income, new business sales, invested assets, and premiums and contract charges.           For Investments: exposure to market risk, credit
quality/experience, total return, net investment income, cash flows, realized capital
gains and losses, unrealized capital gains and losses, stability of long-term returns, and asset and liability duration.           For financial condition: liquidity, parent holding company level
of deployable assets, financial strength ratings, operating leverage,
debt leverage, book value per share, and return on equity.    

Summary of Results:     

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders was $2.75 billion in 2014 compared to $2.26 billion in 2013 and
$2.31 billion in 2012. The increase in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower loss on disposition charges related to the Lincoln Benefit Life Company ("LBL") sale
recorded in Allstate Financial and lower loss on extinguishment of debt charges reported in Corporate and Other, partially offset by lower net income available to common shareholders from
Property-Liability. The decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher net income available to common shareholders from Property-Liability and the curtailment gain reported in Corporate
and Other being more than offset by the estimated loss on disposition related to the pending LBL sale recorded in Allstate Financial and the loss on extinguishment of debt and benefit settlement
charges reported in Corporate and Other. Net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share was $6.27, $4.81 and $4.68 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.           Allstate
Protection had underwriting income of $1.89 billion in 2014 compared to $2.36 billion in 2013 and
$1.25 billion in 2012. The decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to decreases in underwriting income in homeowners, auto and other personal lines resulting from increased
catastrophe losses. The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to increases in underwriting income in homeowners, other personal lines and auto resulting from decreased catastrophe
losses. The Allstate Protection combined ratio was 93.5, 91.5 and 95.3 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Underwriting income (loss), a measure not based on accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ("GAAP"), is defined in the Property-Liability Operations section of the MD A.           Allstate Financial net income available to common shareholders was
$631 million in 2014 compared to $95 million in 2013
and $541 million in 2012. The increase in 2014 primarily relates to lower loss on disposition charges related to the LBL sale, partially offset by the reduction in business due to the sale of
LBL on April 1,

2014 HIGHLIGHTS     

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders was $2.75 billion in 2014 compared to $2.26 billion in 2013.
Net income available to common shareholders per diluted common share was $6.27 in 2014 compared to $4.81 in 2013. 2013 consolidated net income included the impact of an estimated loss on disposition
on LBL of $521 million, a postretirement benefits curtailment gain of $118 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $319 million, and benefit settlement charges of
$150 million due to the level of lump sum pension payments in 2013.           Property-Liability net income available to common shareholders was $2.43 billion in 2014 compared to
$2.75 billion in
2013.           The Property-Liability combined ratio was 93.9 in 2014 compared to 92.0 in 2013.           Allstate Financial net income
available to common shareholders was $631 million in 2014 compared to $95 million in 2013.        
   On April 1, 2014, we closed the sale of LBL's life insurance business generated through independent master
brokerage agencies, and all of LBL's deferred fixed annuity and long-term care insurance business to Resolution Life Holdings, Inc.           Total revenues were $35.24 billion in 2014
compared to $34.51 billion in 2013.           Property-Liability premiums earned totaled $28.93 billion in 2014, an increase of 4.7% from $27.62 billion in 2013.
          Investments totaled $81.11 billion as of December 31, 2014, decreasing from $81.16 billion as of
December 31, 2013. Net investment income was $3.46 billion in 2014, a decrease of 12.3% from $3.94 billion in 2013.           Net realized capital gains were $694 million in
2014 compared to $594 million in 2013.           Book value per diluted common share (ratio of common shareholders' equity to total common shares outstanding and dilutive potential
common shares outstanding) was $48.24 as of December 31, 2014, an increase of 6.5% from $45.31 as of December 31, 2013.           For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014,
return on the average of beginning and ending period common shareholders' equity
of 13.3% increased by 2.3 points from 11.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013.           As of December 31, 2014, shareholders' equity was $22.30 billion. This total
included $3.42 billion in deployable
assets at the parent holding company level.

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME     

IMPACT OF LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT     

         Long-term U.S. Treasury rates fell in 2014, and our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the overall portfolio income
yield, primarily for our investments in fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans. At the January 2015 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to
 1 / 4  percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess
progress   both realized and expected   toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Additionally, the Committee noted that it can
be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. Many market participants anticipate that interest rates, particularly those at the shorter end of the term structure, will begin to
rise but remain below historic levels in 2015. We also expect capital markets to experience periods of increased volatility in 2015.   

         Deferred
annuity contracts with fixed and guaranteed crediting rates, or floors that limit crediting rate reductions, are adversely impacted by a prolonged low interest rate environment
since we may not be able to reduce crediting rates sufficiently to maintain investment spreads. Financial results of long duration products that do not have stated crediting rate guarantees but for
which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than portfolio rates, such as structured settlements and term life insurance, may also be adversely impacted. Our
investment strategy

  for
structured settlements includes increasing investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic operating or market performance,
including limited partnerships, equities and real estate. We stopped selling new fixed annuity products January 1, 2014.   

         The
following table summarizes the weighted average guaranteed crediting rates and weighted average current crediting rates as of December 31, 2014 for certain fixed annuities and
interest-sensitive life contracts where management has the ability to change the crediting rate, subject to a contractual minimum. Other products, including equity-indexed, variable and immediate
annuities, equity-indexed and variable life, and institutional products totaling $6.22 billion of contractholder funds, have been excluded from the analysis because management does not have the
ability to change the crediting rate or the minimum crediting rate is not considered meaningful in this context.   

(1)     These
contracts include interest rate guarantee periods which are typically 5, 7 or 10 years.    

Investing
activity will continue to decrease our portfolio yield as long as market yields remain below the current portfolio yield. In the Allstate Financial segment, the portfolio yield
has been less impacted by reinvestment in the current low interest rate environment, as much of the investment cash flows have been used to fund the managed reduction in spread-based liabilities. The
declines in both invested assets and portfolio yield are expected to result in lower net investment income in future periods.   

         For
the Allstate Financial Segment, we expect approximately 5.6% of the amortized cost of fixed income securities not subject to prepayment and approximately 6.5% of commercial mortgage
loans to mature in 2015. Allstate Financial has $24.84 billion of such fixed income securities and $3.82 billion of such commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2014.
Additionally, for asset-backed securities ("ABS"), residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") that have the potential for prepayment and are
therefore not categorized by contractual maturity, we received periodic principal payments of $667 million in 2014. To the extent portfolio cash flows are reinvested, the average pre-tax
investment yield of 5.6% is expected to decline due to lower market yields.   

         For
the Property-Liability segment, we expect approximately 6.9% of the amortized cost of fixed income securities not subject to prepayment to mature in 2015. Property-Liability has
$27.05 billion of such assets as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, for ABS, RMBS and CMBS securities that have the potential for prepayment and are therefore not categorized by
contractual maturity, we received periodic principal payments of $533 million in 2014. We shortened the maturity profile of the fixed income securities in this segment to make the portfolio
less sensitive to a future rise in interest rates. This approach to reducing interest rate risk resulted in realized capital gains in 2013 and 2012, but contributed to lower portfolio yields as sales
proceeds were invested at lower market yields. The average pre-tax investment yield of 3.6% may decline to the extent reinvestment is at lower market yields. Additionally, the portfolio yield will
respond more quickly to changes in market interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile.   

         In
order to mitigate the unfavorable impact that the current interest rate environment could have on investment results, we are:  

Managing our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a shorter maturity profile in the Property-Liability portfolio which will
also result in the yield responding more quickly to changes in market interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile.           Shifting the portfolio mix over time to have less
reliance on investments whose returns come primarily from interest payments to
investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic operating or market performance, including limited partnerships, equities and real
estate.           Investing to the specific needs and characteristics of Allstate's businesses.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES     

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:  

Fair value of financial assets           Impairment of fixed income and equity securities           Deferred policy acquisition costs amortization           Reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation
          Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits estimation

In
making these determinations, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies,
estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our businesses and operations. It is reasonably likely that changes in these
estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   

         A
brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements, and the
judgments and assumptions related to these estimates, see the referenced sections of this document. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.   

           Fair value of financial assets       Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. We
use independent third-party valuation service providers, broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values. We obtain or calculate only one single quote or price for each financial
instrument.   

         Valuation
service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of proprietary models, produce
valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual fixed income and other securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements. The inputs used
by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, credit
spreads, liquidity spreads, currency rates, and other information, as applicable. Credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable
securities. Valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market
participants to value the same financial instruments. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date, as described above, as well
as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and where applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific
information. Executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience. For certain equity securities, valuation service providers provide market quotations for
completed transactions on the measurement date. In cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the
availability of market observable information.   

         For
certain of our financial assets measured at fair value, where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations, we obtain a single non-binding price quote
from a broker familiar with the security who, similar to our valuation service providers, may consider transactions or activity in similar securities among other information. The brokers providing
price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with market making, underwriting and distribution expertise regarding the security subject to valuation.   

The
fair value of certain financial assets, including privately placed corporate fixed income securities and certain free-standing derivatives, for which our valuation service providers
or brokers do not provide fair value determinations, is determined using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry. Our internal pricing methods are primarily
based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that develop a single best estimate of fair value. Our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other
market   

  33  

Table of Contents   

  participants
would use to determine fair value of the same instruments, including yield curves, quoted market prices of comparable securities, published credit spreads, and other applicable market
data as well as instrument-specific characteristics that include, but are not limited to, coupon rates, expected cash flows, sector of the issuer, and call provisions. Judgment is required in
developing these fair values. As a result, the fair value of these financial assets may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Moreover, the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets' fair values.   

         For
most of our financial assets measured at fair value, all significant inputs are based on or corroborated by market observable data and significant management judgment does not affect
the periodic determination of fair value. The determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on or corroborated
by market observable data. However, where market observable data is available, it takes precedence, and as a result, no range of reasonably likely inputs exists from which the basis of a sensitivity
analysis could be constructed.   

         We
gain assurance that our financial assets are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent
application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with accounting standards. For fair values received from third parties or internally estimated, our processes
and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of
determining fair value, and the fair values are accurately recorded. For example, on a continuing basis, we assess the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that
exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models. We perform procedures to understand and assess the
methodologies, processes and controls of valuation service providers. In addition, we may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers
or brokers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities. We perform ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs
used in internal models to market observable data. When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant
expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions.   

We
also perform an analysis to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity, and if
so, whether transactions may not be orderly. Among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for a specific asset has occurred
include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, level of credit spreads over historical levels, bid-ask spread, and price consensuses among market
participants and sources. If evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly, we place little, if any, weight on the transaction price and will estimate fair value using
an
internal model. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not adjust fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal model for such
securities.   

         The
following table identifies fixed income and equity securities and short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 by source of fair value determination:

$2.07 billion that are valued using broker quotes.    

For
additional detail on fair value measurements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.   

Impairment of fixed income and equity securities       For investments classified as available for sale, the difference between fair value and
amortized
cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities, net of certain other items and deferred income taxes (as disclosed in Note 5), is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a
transaction with an unrelated third party or   

  34  

Table of Contents   

  when
a write-down is recorded due to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security
whose carrying value may be other-than-temporarily impaired.   

         For
each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than
not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets either of these
criteria, the security's decline in fair value is considered other than temporary and is recorded in earnings.   

         If
we have not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its
amortized cost basis, we evaluate whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We use our best estimate of future cash flows expected
to be collected from the fixed income security, discounted at the security's original or current effective rate, as appropriate, to calculate a recovery value and determine whether a credit loss
exists. The determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information
relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable assumptions and forecasts, are considered when developing the estimate of cash
flows expected to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, foreign exchange rates, the financial
condition and future earnings potential of the issue or
issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, vintage, geographic concentration, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third party
guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income
securities, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if we
determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement. If the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized cost of the security, a credit loss exists
and an other-than-temporary impairment for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other
than credit remains classified in accumulated other comprehensive income. If we determine that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery
value for the security, we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings.   

         There
are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments of equity securities and determining if they are other than temporary, including: 1) our ability
and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or
issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends, geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; 3) the specific reasons that a
security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity; and 4) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than
cost.   

         Once
assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to subsequently determine that a fixed income or equity security is
other-than-temporarily impaired, including: 1) general economic conditions that are worse than previously forecasted or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer or industry
sector than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes
in facts and circumstances that result in management's decision to sell or result in our assessment that it is more likely than not we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost
basis of a fixed income security or causes a change in our ability or intent to hold an equity security until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in
additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on
shareholders' equity, since our securities are designated as available for sale and carried at fair value and as a result, any related unrealized loss, net of deferred income taxes and related DAC,
deferred sales inducement costs and reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.   

         The
determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairment is an inherently subjective process based on periodic evaluations of the factors described above. Such evaluations and
assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. We update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other-than-temporary impairments in results of operations
as such evaluations are revised. The use of different   

  35  

Table of Contents   

  methodologies
and assumptions in the determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.   

         For
additional detail on investment impairments, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.   

           Deferred policy acquisition costs amortization       We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring insurance policies and investment
contracts.
In accordance with GAAP, costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies and investment contracts are deferred and recorded as an asset on the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.   

         DAC
related to property-liability contracts is amortized into income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six or twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC related
to Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates.   

         DAC
related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Significant
assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment returns, as well as mortality, persistency and expenses to administer the business are established at the time the policy is issued and are
generally not revised during the life of the policy. The assumptions for determining the timing and amount of DAC amortization are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate the reserve for
life-contingent contract benefits. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may
result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies. The recovery of
DAC is dependent upon the future profitability of the business. We periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of DAC for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual
experience. We aggregate all traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies in the analysis. In the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to
the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and a premium deficiency reserve may be
required if the remaining DAC balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary, primarily due to
projected profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies.   

         DAC
related to interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits, which
includes both actual historical gross profits ("AGP") and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. The amortization is net of interest on
the prior period DAC balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts. Actual amortization periods generally range from 15-30 years; however, incorporating estimates of the
rate of customer surrenders, partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the DAC being amortized during the surrender charge period, which is typically 10-20 years for
interest-sensitive life and 5-10 years for fixed annuities. The cumulative DAC amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income when there is a difference
between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total EGP.   

AGP
and EGP primarily consist of the following components: contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits (benefit margin); investment income and
realized capital gains and losses less interest credited (investment margin); and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses (expense margin). The principal assumptions for
determining the amount of EGP are persistency, mortality, expenses, investment returns, including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to
contractholders, and the effects of any hedges, and these assumptions are reasonably likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of DAC amortization. Changes in these assumptions can be
offsetting and we are unable to reasonably predict their future movements or offsetting impacts over time.   

Each
reporting period, DAC amortization is recognized in proportion to AGP for that period adjusted for interest on the prior period DAC balance. This amortization process includes an
assessment of AGP compared to EGP, the actual amount of business remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting the product liability. The impact of realized
capital gains and losses on amortization of DAC depends upon which product liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the gain or loss. If the AGP is greater than EGP in the period, but
the total EGP is unchanged, the amount of DAC amortization will generally increase, resulting in a current period decrease to earnings. The opposite result generally occurs when the AGP is less than
the EGP in the period, but the total EGP is unchanged. However, when DAC amortization or a component of gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially negative (which   

  36  

Table of Contents   

  would
result in an increase of the DAC balance) as a result of negative AGP, the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the potential negative amortization are considered to determine whether it
is appropriate for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Negative amortization is only recorded when the increased DAC balance is determined to be recoverable based on facts and
circumstances. Negative amortization was not recorded for certain fixed annuities during 2012 in which capital losses were realized on their related investment portfolio. For products whose supporting
investments are exposed to capital losses in excess of our expectations which may cause periodic AGP to become temporarily negative, EGP and AGP utilized in DAC amortization may be modified to exclude
the excess capital losses.   

         Annually,
we review and update all assumptions underlying the projections of EGP, including persistency, mortality, expenses, investment returns, comprising investment income and
realized capital gains and losses, interest crediting rates and the effect of any hedges. At each reporting period, we assess whether any revisions to assumptions used to determine DAC amortization
are required. These reviews and updates may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration, which are referred to as "DAC unlocking". If the update of assumptions causes total EGP to increase,
the rate of DAC amortization will generally decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. A decrease to earnings generally occurs when the assumption update causes the total EGP to
decrease.   

         The
following table provides the effect on DAC amortization of changes in assumptions relating to the gross profit components of investment margin, benefit margin and expense margin
during the years ended December 31.   

In
2014, DAC amortization acceleration for changes in the investment margin component of EGP related to interest-sensitive life insurance and fixed annuities and was due to lower
projected investment returns. The acceleration related to benefit margin primarily related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected mortality. The deceleration
related to expense margin primarily related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to a decrease in projected expenses.   

In
2013, DAC amortization deceleration for changes in the investment margin component of EGP primarily related to fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to
increased projected investment margins. The acceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected mortality. The
acceleration related to expense margin related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was due to an increase in projected expenses.   

         In
2012, DAC amortization acceleration for changes in the investment margin component of EGP primarily related to fixed annuities and was due to lower projected investment returns. The
acceleration related to benefit margin was primarily due to increased projected mortality on variable life insurance, partially offset by increased projected persistency on interest-sensitive life
insurance. The deceleration related to expense margin related to interest-sensitive life insurance and fixed annuities and was due to a decrease in projected expenses.   

         The
following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions included in the gross profit components of investment margin or benefit margin to amortization of
the DAC balance as of December 31, 2014.

           Reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation       Reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of
paying
claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued. Property-Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability insurance claims and claims
expense reserves. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the financial
statement date.   

           Characteristics of reserves       Reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of
business
based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims, less losses that have been paid. The significant lines of business are auto, homeowners, and other personal lines for Allstate Protection, and
asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines for Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection's claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between
the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported. Auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle, while auto physical damage, homeowners property
and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year. Discontinued Lines and Coverages involve long-tail losses, such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims,
which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle.   

         Reserves
are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date. Reserves are estimated for both reported and
unreported claims, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims. We update most of our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes
available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior reserve estimates (reserve reestimates), which may be material, are determined by comparing updated
estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates, and the differences are recorded as property-liability insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period
such changes are determined. Estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently
uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables.   

           The actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates       Reserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods
that
are variations on one primary actuarial technique. The actuarial technique is known as a "chain ladder" estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and
reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An
accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both
classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim
counts, paid losses, case reserves, and development factors calculated with this data.   

In
the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A
three-year or two-year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into
the next time period. The development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each
accident year. The implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss development, as the significant size of our experience
database achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process, the implicit assumption
being that a multi-year average development factor includes an adequate provision. Occasionally, unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in
claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes, and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor
selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate
losses.   

          How reserve estimates are established and updated       Reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level, and the results of these numerous
micro-level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate. For example, over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to
estimate losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. The actuarial methods
described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process.
Development factors are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves.
The calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity trends, which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates. The
historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates.

         Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other
influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as described above. These micro-level estimates
are not based on a single set of assumptions. Actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro-level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated
level of reserves. Moreover, this detailed micro-level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company-wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be
meaningful. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the required reserves for each
component are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.   

         Reserves
are reestimated quarterly and periodically throughout the year, by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors. This process
incorporates the historic and latest actual trends, and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates. New development factors are likely to differ from previous
development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results (claims reported or settled, losses paid, or changes to case reserves) occur differently than the
implied assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations. If claims reported, paid losses, or case reserve changes are greater or less than the levels estimated by previous
development factors, reserve reestimates increase or decrease. When actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve
estimate, a new reserve is determined. The difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves (the previous estimate) is the amount of reserve reestimate and is
recognized as an increase or decrease in property-liability insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Property-Liability net reserve reestimates,
after-tax, as a percent of net income available to common shareholders were favorable 2.0%, 3.5%, and 18.7% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 3-year average of net reserve reestimates as a
percentage of total reserves was a favorable 1.7% for Property-Liability, a favorable 2.5% for Allstate Protection and an unfavorable 6.2% for Discontinued Lines and Coverages, each of these results
being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses. A more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the Property-Liability Claims and Claims
Expense Reserves section of this document.   

         The
following table shows net claims and claims expense reserves by segment and line of business as of December 31:   

Allstate Protection reserve estimates     

           Factors affecting reserve estimates       Reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends described above.
These
estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving
claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic conditions.
When we experience changes of the type previously mentioned, we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new
trends, such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two-year, three-year, or longer development periods to
reestimate our reserves. For example, if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in
a specific state,   

  39  

Table of Contents   

  actuarial
judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate. Another example would be when a change in
economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line, coverage, or state, actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development
factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development.   

         As
claims are reported, for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity, the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost, based on their
assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim. For other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame, it is not practical or efficient to
set case reserves for each claim, and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimation techniques described above. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our
claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, and other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related
claims.   

         Historically,
the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims. To provide for this, a development
reserve is estimated using the processes described above, and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves. Typically, the case, including statistical case, and supplemental
development reserves comprise about 90% of total reserves.   

         Another
major component of reserves is incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). Typically, IBNR comprises about 10% of total reserves.   

Generally,
the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical
relationships to relevant inflation indicators, and reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes described above. Changes in auto current year claim severity are
generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by
medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in
average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Maintenance and Repair price index and the Parts and Equipment price index. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements
to the claim review and settlement process, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various other
loss management initiatives underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends.   

         Changes
in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost
of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles and other economic and environmental factors. We employ various loss management programs to
mitigate the effect of these factors.   

         As
loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss, it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility.
From that point in time and forward, reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial
estimation processes. Statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year; however, when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner, they are
usually determined to be credible, and reserves are increased accordingly.   

         The
very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates, and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors, limits aggregate reserve level
testing for variability of data elements. However, by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types, comprising auto injury losses, auto
physical damage losses and homeowner losses, we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors, as described in
the section titled "Potential Reserve Estimate Variability" below.   

           Causes of reserve estimate uncertainty       Since reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred,
including
IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate.   

At
each reporting date, the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding
accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or
settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. Most of these losses relate to   

  40  

Table of Contents   

  damaged
property such as automobiles and homes, and medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that
accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent
in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the
losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides
a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the
accident year, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.   

           Reserves for catastrophe losses       Property-Liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses.
Catastrophe
losses are an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance industry that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to potentially material year-to-year fluctuations in our results of
operations and financial position. We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders,
or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event.
Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. We are also exposed to
man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted.   

         The
estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophe losses also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, primarily for damage to property. In
general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described above. However, depending on the nature
of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated. For example, for hurricanes, complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, limitations placed
on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses, determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or
specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, estimating additional living expenses, and assessing the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other
considerations, including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period, which can affect the availability of information needed
to estimate reserves for that reporting period. In these situations, we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a
catastrophe. As an example, in 2005 to complete an estimate for certain areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff, or where we believed our historical
loss development factors were not predictive, we relied on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total PIF, as well as visual, governmental and third party information, including
aerial photos, area observations, and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available.   

           Potential reserve estimate variability       The aggregation of numerous micro-level estimates for each business segment, line of insurance, major
components of losses (such as coverages and perils), and major states or groups of states for reported losses and IBNR forms the reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position. Because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates, there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level. Given the
numerous micro-level
estimates for reported losses and IBNR, management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful.
Reserve estimates, by their very nature, are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment, and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim. Accordingly, as
actual claims, paid losses, and/or case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated.   

To
develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes, an actuarial technique (stochastic modeling) is applied to the
countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses, auto physical damage losses, and homeowners losses excluding
catastrophe losses. Based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements, an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these
reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last twenty years for each type of loss. The variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean (a
measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy) is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability.
Based on our products and coverages, historical experience, the statistical credibility of our   

  41  

Table of Contents   

  extensive
data and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves,
excluding reserves for catastrophe losses, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be approximately plus or minus 4%, or plus or minus $500 million in net income
available to common shareholders. A lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses, which comprise approximately 80% of reserves, due to their relatively stable development patterns over a
longer duration of time required to settle claims. Other types of losses, such as auto physical damage, homeowners losses and other personal lines losses, which comprise about 20% of reserves, tend to
have greater variability but are settled in a much shorter period of time. Although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above
these amounts. Historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of this document.   

Reserves for Michigan and New Jersey unlimited personal injury protection       Property-Liability claims and claims expense reserves include
reserves for
Michigan unlimited personal injury protection ("PIP") which is a mandatory coverage that provides unlimited personal injury protection to covered insureds involved in certain auto and motorcycle
accidents. The administration of this program is through a private, non-profit association created by the state of Michigan, the Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA"). Due to increasing
costs of providing healthcare related to serious injuries and advances in medical care extending the duration of treatment, the estimation processes have been enhanced and assumptions for this reserve
balance have been contemporized to the current validated conditions.   

         The
process that resulted in an increase in MCCA covered losses involved a number of activities that occurred over multiple years and included the comprehensive review and interpretation
of MCCA actuarial reports, other MCCA members' reports and our PIP loss trends which have increased in severity over time. To address this exposure, we refined our ultimate claim reserve estimation
techniques in 2011 through 2014, including relying more on paid loss development methods and increasing our view of future claim development and longevity of claimants, as a result of conducting
comprehensive claim file reviews to develop case reserve type estimates of
specific claims and other estimation refinements. In 2014 we completed the multi-year comprehensive review and incorporated the findings into our reserve estimation factors. We report our paid and
unpaid claims and case reserves, which include our best estimate of the ultimate claim cost, excluding IBNR to the MCCA based on their requirements. The MCCA does not provide participating companies
with its estimate of a company's claim costs.   

         We
provide similar PIP coverage in New Jersey for auto policies issued or renewed in New Jersey prior to 1991 that is administered by the New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund
("NJUCJF"). In 2013, we adopted similar actuarial estimating techniques as for the MCCA exposures to estimate loss reserves for unlimited PIP coverage for policies covered by the NJUCJF. The NJUCJF
was merged into the New Jersey Property Liability Guaranty Association who collects the assessments. Upon completion of our comprehensive review in 2014, we updated our reserve estimation techniques
and factors, similar to the processes followed to develop the MCCA reserves, which resulted in an increase in reserves for unlimited PIP coverage for policies covered by the NJUCJF.   

         Reserve
estimates by their nature are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgments, and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim. As actual
claims, paid losses and/or case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle may be materially greater or less than previously estimated amounts.   

           Adequacy of reserve estimates       We believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available
methodologies,
facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components
(coverages and perils) and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses, and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, the
ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates.   

Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserve estimates     

          Characteristics of Discontinued Lines exposure       Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally
from
assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large U.S. companies, and from direct excess insurance written from
1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on large U.S. companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through
the mid-1980s. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution
and related clean-up costs. Other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices   

  42  

Table of Contents   

  and
other products, workers' compensation claims and claims for various other coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental.   

         In
1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property-liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage
for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General
liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these
policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks.   

         Our
exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct
excess insurance or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in
nature.   

         Direct
excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and
reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by
the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business.   

         Our
assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers' reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion
of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15%
is for pro-rata coverage.   

         Our
direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many
diverse business sectors located throughout the country.   

           How reserve estimates are established and updated       We conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate and establish asbestos,
environmental
and other discontinued lines reserves. Changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no
change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim
activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the
characteristics of exposure (i.e. environmental damages, respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, appropriateness and cost of remediation) to pollution and related
clean-up costs. The number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs, and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection
as a
result of asbestos liabilities, initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims, often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur.   

         After
evaluating our insureds' probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, we evaluate our insureds' coverage programs for such claims. We consider our insureds' total
available insurance coverage, including the coverage we issued. We also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.   

         Evaluation
of both the insureds' estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This
analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel. Based on these evaluations, case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is
employed to develop an IBNR reserve, which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, IBNR was
56.9% and 55.4%, respectively, of combined net asbestos and environmental reserves.   

         For
both asbestos and environmental reserves, we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or
characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity.   

  43

           Other Discontinued Lines and Coverages       The following table shows reserves for other discontinued lines which provide for remaining loss and
loss
expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us, other than asbestos and environmental, as of December 31.   

Other
mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers' compensation and
commercial and other include run-off from discontinued direct primary, direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and
environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those described above, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures.   

Potential reserve estimate variability       Establishing Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other
discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays,
uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability
and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs' evolving and expanding theories of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance; retrospectively determined premiums
and other contractual agreements; estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos
defendants; and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever
intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent
conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are
determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could
be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal
Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient
system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts
currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of
this document.   

          Adequacy of reserve estimates       Management believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are
appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim activity, potential
liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Due to the uncertainties
and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.   

Further discussion of reserve estimates       For further discussion of these estimates and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates,
reserve
reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 8 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of this document.   

           Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits estimation       Due to the long term nature of traditional life insurance, life-contingent immediate
annuities and voluntary accident and health insurance products, benefits are payable over many years; accordingly, the reserves are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be
paid, reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums. Long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when
establishing the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits payable under these insurance policies. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium
method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined
based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and   

  44  

Table of Contents   

  policy
termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium-paying
period. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued, are consistent with assumptions for determining DAC amortization for these policies, and are generally not changed during
the policy coverage period. However, if actual experience emerges in a manner that is significantly adverse relative to the original assumptions, adjustments to DAC or reserves may be required
resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition. We periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of DAC for
these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience. In the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to
exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, our reviews
concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary, primarily due to projected profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with
life contingencies. We will continue to monitor the experience of our traditional life insurance and immediate annuities. We anticipate that mortality, investment and reinvestment yields, and policy
terminations are the factors that would be most likely to require premium deficiency adjustments to these reserves or related DAC.   

         For
further detail on the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits, see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS     

            Overview    Our Property-Liability operations consist of two reporting segments: Allstate
Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages. Allstate Protection comprises three brands where we accept underwriting risk: Allstate, Esurance and Encompass. Allstate Protection is principally
engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and
Coverages includes results from property-liability insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other
businesses in run-off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.   

         Underwriting
income, a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income available to common shareholders below, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims
expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges, as determined using GAAP. We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to
analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. It is useful for investors to
evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Net income available to common shareholders is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to underwriting
income. Underwriting income should not be considered as a substitute for net income available to common shareholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business.   

         The
table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability. We believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability. They are calculated as
follows:  

Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio   the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned. Loss ratios
include the impact of catastrophe losses.    
  45  

Table of Contents   

Expense ratio   the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, and restructuring and related
charges to premiums earned.           Combined ratio   the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, and
restructuring and related charges to premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting
income as a percentage of premiums earned, or underwriting margin.    

         We
have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods.   

Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio   the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims
expense to premiums earned. This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.           Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio   the
percentage of prior year reserve reestimates
included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned. This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.           Effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets
on combined and expense ratio   the percentage of
amortization of purchased intangible assets to premiums earned.           Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio   the percentage of restructuring and related
charges
to premiums earned.           Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio   the ratio of claims and claims expense and operating
costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned. The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the
Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT     

           Overview and strategy       The Allstate Protection segment primarily sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through
agencies
and directly through contact centers and the internet. These products are marketed under the Allstate , Esurance  and Encompass  brand names.   

         Our
strategy is to position our products and distribution systems to meet the changing needs of the customer in managing the risks they face. This includes customers who want local
advice and assistance and those who are self-directed. In addition, there are customers who are brand-sensitive and those who are brand-neutral. Our strategy is to serve all four of these consumer
segments with unique products and in innovative ways while leveraging our claims, pricing and operational capabilities. When we do not offer a product our customers need, we may make available
non-proprietary products that meet their needs.   

         We
utilize specific customer value propositions for each brand to improve our competitive position and performance. Over time, delivering on these customer value propositions may include
investments in resources and require significant changes to our products, service, capabilities and processes.   

         Our
strategy for the Allstate brand focuses on customers who prefer local personal advice and service and are brand-sensitive. Our customer-focused strategy for the Allstate brand aligns
targeted marketing, product innovation, distribution effectiveness, and pricing toward acquiring and retaining an increased share of our target customers. This refers to consumers who want to purchase
multiple products from one insurance provider including auto, homeowners and financial products, who potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their
relationships with us.   

         The
Allstate brand utilizes marketing delivered to target customers to promote our strategic priorities, with messaging that communicates the value of our "Good Hands ", the
importance of having proper coverage by highlighting our comprehensive product and coverage options, and the ease of doing business with Allstate and Allstate agencies.   

         To
better serve customers who prefer local and personalized advice, we are undergoing a focused effort to position agents, licensed sales professionals and financial specialists to serve
customers as trusted advisors. This means they know customers and understand the unique needs of their households, help them assess the potential risks they face and provide personalized guidance on
how to protect what matters most to them. To ensure agencies have the resources, capacity and support needed to serve customers at this level, we have strategic efforts underway to enhance agency
capabilities while simplifying and automating service processes to enable agencies to focus more time in an advisory role and provide appropriate product offerings.   

         The
Allstate brand differentiates itself from competitors by offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features through a network of agencies that provide local
advice and service. Product features include Allstate Your Choice Auto  with options such as accident forgiveness, safe driving deductible rewards and a safe driving bonus, and Allstate
House and Home  that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. In addition, we offer a Claim Satisfaction
Guarantee sm  that promises a return of premium to Allstate brand auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience. Our Drivewise  program, available in 46
states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2014, uses an in-car device or a mobile application to capture driving behaviors and reward customers for driving safely. We are also
testing additional features which extend the benefits of being connected beyond auto insurance pricing. The recently introduced Star Driver  program encourages an ongoing conversation
about safe driving through an easy-to-use application to develop teens' confidence behind the wheel. We will continue to focus on developing and introducing products and services that benefit today's
consumers and further differentiate Allstate and enhance the customer experience. We plan to deepen customer relationships through value-added customer interactions and expanding our presence in
households with multiple products by providing financial protection for customer needs. In certain areas with higher risk of catastrophes, we offer a homeowners product from North Light Specialty
Insurance Company ("North Light"), our excess and surplus lines carrier. When an Allstate product is not available, we may make available non-proprietary products for customers through brokering
arrangements. For example, in hurricane
exposed areas, Allstate agencies sell non-proprietary property insurance products to customers who prefer to use a single agent for all their insurance needs.   

We
are undergoing a focused effort to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency by implementing processes and standards to elevate the level and consistency of our customer experience. We
continue to enhance technology to improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims.
These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brand's exclusive agencies.

         Other
personal lines sold under the Allstate brand include renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies. Commercial lines include insurance
products for small business owners. Other business lines include Allstate Roadside Services that provides roadside assistance products, including Good Hands Roadside  Allstate Dealer
Services that provides service contracts and other products sold in conjunction with auto lending and vehicle sales transactions; and Ivantage that is a general agency for Allstate exclusive agencies.   

Our
strategy for the Esurance brand focuses on self-directed consumers. To best serve these customers, Esurance develops its technology, website and mobile capabilities to continuously
improve its hassle-free purchase and claims experience and offer innovative product options and features. Esurance continues to develop additional products to complement its auto line of business and
provide a more comprehensive solution to its customers. Esurance also continues to invest in geographic expansion of its products. Esurance expanded its renter product in 2014 from 16 to 19 states,
motorcycle from 6 to 11 states, homeowners from 3 to 14 states and auto from 41 to 43 states. Esurance continues to focus on increasing its preferred driver mix, while raising advertising expenditures
and marketing effectiveness to support growth. Esurance's DriveSense  program, available in 28 states as of December 31, 2014, enables participating customers to be eligible for
discounts based on driving performance as measured by a device installed in the vehicle. Esurance's DriveSafe  program is designed to help parents coach teens on safe driving by providing
customizable driving statistics and the ability to limit cell phone use while the car is in motion, all controlled by a device installed in the vehicle.   

         Our
strategy for the Encompass brand centers around a highly differentiated offering which simplifies the insurance experience by packaging a product with broader coverage and higher
limits into a single annual household ("package") policy with one premium, one bill, one property deductible, one renewal date and one advisor   an independent insurance agent. It
especially appeals to the approximately 35 million mass affluent households in the U.S., with their higher average premiums and preference for professional advice regarding coverage needs and
risk solutions. Package policies represent over 80% of the Encompass portfolio of business, with concentrations in suburban and urban areas throughout the country. Package policies currently are not
offered in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas. In pursuit of this strategy and to achieve its financial objectives, Encompass is seeking to diversify through new business writings in states where
the risk return opportunities meet its requirements, while aggressively executing pricing, underwriting, and other actions to manage risk and ensure adequate profitability.   

Answer
Financial, an independent personal lines insurance agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice between insurance carriers and offers comparison quotes
for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 25 insurance companies through its website and over the phone. It receives commissions for this service.   

         Our
pricing and underwriting strategies and decisions for all of our brands are primarily designed to achieve appropriate returns along with enhancing our competitive position. Our
sophisticated pricing methodology allows us to attract and retain multiple risk segments. A combination of underwriting information, pricing and discounts are used to achieve a more competitive
position. Our pricing uses a number of risk evaluation factors including insurance scoring, to the extent permissible by applicable law, based on information that is obtained from credit reports, and
other factors. Our pricing strategy involves marketplace pricing and underwriting decisions that are based on these risk evaluation models and an evaluation of competitors.   

         We
continue to manage our property catastrophe exposure with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the
variability of our earnings. Our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property and other property insurance lines. As of December 31, 2014, we have less than a 1%
likelihood of exceeding average annual aggregate catastrophe losses by $2 billion, net of reinsurance, from hurricanes and earthquakes, based on modeled assumptions and applications currently
available. The use of different assumptions and updates to industry models, and updates to our risk transfer program, could materially change the projected loss. Our growth strategies include areas
previously restricted where we believe we can earn an appropriate return for the risk and as a result our exposure may increase, but remain lower than $2 billion as noted above. In addition, we
have exposure to severe weather events which impact catastrophe losses.   

         Property
catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes and
other catastrophes. We are also working to promote measures to prevent and mitigate losses and make homes and communities more resilient, including enactment of stronger building codes and effective
enforcement of those codes, adoption of sensible land use policies, and development of effective and affordable methods of improving the resilience of existing structures.   

         Pricing
of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long-term period. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and
weather-related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and   

  49  

Table of Contents   

  freeze
losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe), are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic
events and weather-related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products' pricing. We pursue rate increases
where indicated, taking into consideration potential customer disruption, the impact on our ability to market our auto lines, regulatory limitations, our competitive position and profitability, using
a methodology that appropriately addresses the changing costs of losses from catastrophes such as severe weather and the net cost of reinsurance.   

Allstate Protection outlook     

Allstate Protection will continue to focus on its strategy of offering differentiated products and services to our customers while
maintaining pricing discipline.           We expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results;
however, this volatility will be mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions, including the purchase of reinsurance.           We will continue our evolution to a trusted advisor model,
enabling agencies to more fully deliver on the Allstate brand customer
value proposition.           We will continue to modernize our operating model to efficiently deliver our customer value propositions.           We will invest in building long-term growth platforms.    

Premiums written    is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums are considered earned and are
included in the financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired term of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.   

         The
following table shows the unearned premium balance as of December 31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned.

Gross premiums
written include the impacts from discounts, surcharges and ceded reinsurance premiums and exclude the impacts from mid-term premium adjustments and premium refund accruals. Average premiums represent
the appropriate policy term for each line. Allstate and Esurance brands are 6 months for auto and 12 months for homeowners. Encompass brand is 12 months for auto and homeowners.           Renewal ratio:    Renewal policies issued during the period, based on contract effective dates, divided by the total

Allstate
brand auto premiums written totaled $17.50 billion in 2014, a 4.5% increase from $16.75 billion in 2013. Factors impacting premiums written were the
following:

           0.7 point increase in the renewal ratio in 2013 compared to 2012.    

Esurance
brand auto premiums written totaled $1.50 billion in 2014, an increase of 14.6% from $1.31 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily due to a 10.7% or
138 thousand increase in PIF as of December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013. New issued applications of 747 thousand in 2014 was comparable to 2013. An increase in
quote volume driven by the new advertising program was offset by a decrease in conversion rate (the percentage of completed quotes to actual issued policies) primarily due to rate actions. Rate
actions are taken where profit margin targets are not being achieved. The rate changes in 2014 were taken in states and risk categories to improve profit margin while managing customer retention.
Average premium increased 2.9% in 2014 compared to 2013.   

         Esurance
brand renewal ratio decreased 1.2 points in 2014 compared to 2013. The renewal ratio for the direct to consumer business is generally lower than agency written business
consistent with the direct consumer tendency to shop and change providers based on competitive rates. The renewal ratio is also typically lowest at the first renewal date for new business. The
decrease in the renewal ratio during 2014 was due to the impact of rate increases and growth in states with lower retention, partially offset by an increase in the amount of business past its first
renewal. Retention may continue to be impacted as a result of expansion initiatives that increase the areas in which Esurance writes business. Retention at first renewal was 70.4% during 2014 compared
to 72.8% in 2013. The renewal ratio on business subsequent to first renewal was 82.7% during 2014 compared to 84.1% in 2013.   

         Esurance
brand auto premiums written totaled $1.31 billion in 2013, a 27.7% increase from $1.02 billion in 2012. The increase was primarily due to a 25.0% increase in PIF

compared to $1.42 billion in 2013, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased premiums earned. Auto underwriting income was $604 million in 2014
compared to $668 million in 2013, primarily due to increased losses excluding catastrophes, increased expenses and increased catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased premiums earned.
Other personal lines underwriting income was $150 million in 2014 compared to $198 million in 2013, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased premiums
earned.   

         Allstate
Protection had underwriting income of $2.36 billion in 2013 compared to $1.25 billion in 2012. Homeowners underwriting income was $1.42 billion in 2013
compared to $690 million in 2012, primarily due to decreased catastrophe losses, decreased loss costs excluding catastrophe losses and increased premiums earned, partially offset by lower
favorable reserve reestimates and higher expenses. Other personal lines underwriting income was $198 million in 2013 compared to an underwriting loss of $10 million in 2012, primarily
due to decreased catastrophe losses, decreased loss costs excluding catastrophe losses, increased premiums earned and lower unfavorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher expenses. Auto
underwriting income was $668 million in 2013 compared to $469 million in 2012, primarily due to increased premiums earned and decreased catastrophe losses including favorable Sandy
reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher incurred losses excluding catastrophe losses, higher expenses and lower favorable reserve reestimates.   

            Catastrophe losses    were $1.99 billion in 2014 compared to $1.25 billion in 2013 and $2.35 billion in 2012.   

We
define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that
produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by
various natural events including high winds, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. We are also exposed to man-made
catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.

Catastrophe
losses by the type of event are shown in the following table.   

Catastrophe
losses, including prior year reserve reestimates, excluding hurricanes named or numbered by the National Weather Service, fires following earthquakes and earthquakes, totaled
$2.00 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.32 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

           Combined ratio       Loss ratios by product, and expense and combined ratios by brand, are shown in the following table.   

(1)     Ratios
are calculated using the premiums earned for the respective line of business.    

Auto loss ratio    for the Allstate brand increased 0.7 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses. Auto
loss ratio for the Allstate brand decreased 1.8 points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower favorable reserve reestimates.   

         Claim
frequency in the bodily injury coverages in 2014 was comparable to 2013. Claim frequency in the property damage coverages increased 0.5% in 2014 compared to 2013. We experienced
increased property damage frequency in first quarter 2014 due to severe winter weather experienced in the Midwest and East and in the first two months of fourth quarter 2014 in geographically
widespread areas with improved unemployment rates leading to higher miles driven and areas that experienced higher precipitation. Otherwise, frequencies in bodily injury and property damage performed
within historical ranges. Bodily injury and property damage coverage paid claim severities increased 2.7% and 4.1%, respectively, in 2014 compared to 2013. Severity results in 2014 increased in line
with historical Consumer Price Index trends. Claim frequencies in the bodily injury and property damage coverages decreased 1.1% and increased 0.3%, respectively, in 2013 compared to 2012. Bodily
injury and property damage coverage paid claim severities increased 3.8% and 1.8%, respectively, in 2013 compared to 2012. We pursue rate increases when necessary to maintain margins.   

         Esurance
brand auto loss ratio decreased 1.7 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to rate actions and favorable reserve reestimates related to personal injury protection
losses. We manage the business so that it is profitable over the life of the business, taking rate increases as appropriate. Esurance brand auto loss ratio increased 1.3 points in 2013 compared
to 2012, primarily due to increases in the volume of new business, increased utilization of price discounts and higher unallocated loss adjustment expense, partially offset by lower catastrophe
losses.   

         Encompass
brand auto loss ratio increased 3.6 points in 2014 compared to 2013, due to increased catastrophe losses and lower favorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by increased
premiums earned. Encompass brand auto

  loss
ratio decreased 5.0 points in 2013 compared to 2012, due to lower catastrophe losses, a higher mix of preferred insureds and higher favorable reserve reestimates.   

            Homeowners loss ratio    for the Allstate brand increased 5.3 points to 58.7 in 2014 from 53.4 in 2013, primarily due to higher catastrophe
losses, partially offset by increased premiums earned. Claim frequency excluding catastrophe losses decreased 0.3% in 2014 compared to 2013. Paid claim severity excluding catastrophe losses increased
7.7% in 2014 compared to 2013. The 2-year average annual increase for paid claim severity is approximately 3.5%. Homeowners loss ratio for the Allstate brand decreased 10.7 points to 53.4 in 2013 from
64.1 in 2012, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, decreased loss costs excluding catastrophe losses and increased premiums earned. Claim frequency excluding catastrophe losses decreased 0.3% in
2013 compared to 2012. Paid claim severity excluding catastrophe losses decreased 0.2% in 2013 compared to 2012.   

         Encompass
brand homeowners loss ratio increased 18.4 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. Several catastrophes occurred in areas where Encompass
has a concentration of policyholders.
Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses, the Encompass brand homeowners loss ratio increased 2.8 points in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of severe weather. Encompass brand
homeowners loss ratio decreased 20.2 points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses.   

            Expense ratio    for Allstate Protection decreased 0.4 points in 2014 compared to 2013. The impact of specific costs and expenses on the
expense ratio are shown in the following table.   

Allstate
brand expense ratio decreased 0.6 points in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower advertising expenditures and lower employee related costs, including pension expense,
partially offset by higher amortization of DAC. Amortization of DAC primarily includes agent remuneration and premium taxes. Amortization of DAC increased in 2014 compared to 2013 and Allstate agency
total incurred base commissions, variable compensation and bonus was higher than 2013. Allstate exclusive agent remuneration comprises a base commission, variable compensation and a bonus. Variable
compensation has two components: agency success factors (local presence, Allstate Financial insurance policies sold and licensed staff), which must be achieved in order to qualify for the second
component, and customer satisfaction. In addition, a bonus that is a percentage of premiums can be earned by agents who achieve a targeted loss ratio and a defined amount of Allstate Financial sales.
The bonus is earned by achieving a targeted percentage of multi-category households and increases in Property-Liability and Allstate Financial policies in force. The Allstate agent commissions and
bonus were expensed as a component of DAC amortization at increasing levels during 2013 and continuing in 2014 as more agents met the success factors. In 2014, the bonus success factors were changed
from 2013 levels commensurate with performance achieved in 2013, which was in excess of target amounts.   

Esurance
brand expense ratio increased 1.9 points in 2014 compared to 2013. A significant portion of Esurance's expense ratio relates to customer acquisition. Customer acquisition costs
include amortization of DAC, advertising expenses and a portion of other costs and expenses and totaled 27.3 points in 2014 and 24.1 points in 2013. Esurance advertising expenses in 2014 were higher
than 2013 due to increased spending related to the launch of a new advertising campaign, the homeowners advertising launch in 2014 and additional advertising to achieve short-term growth and long-term
brand positioning. The Esurance brand expense ratio also includes purchased intangible assets that are amortized on an accelerated basis with over 80% of the amortization taking place by 2016. The
other costs and expenses, related to acquisition include salaries of telephone sales personnel and other underwriting costs, was comparable to the prior year.   

         Esurance
uses a direct distribution model, therefore its primary acquisition-related costs are advertising as opposed to commissions. Esurance incurs substantially all of its acquisition
costs in the year of policy inception. As a result, the Esurance expense ratio will be higher during periods of increased advertising expenditures. Total acquisition costs in 2014 were in line with
other distribution channels when considering the cumulative earned premiums of policies sold   

  58  

Table of Contents   

  and
excluding additional advertising to achieve long term brand positioning. Esurance continued to invest in geographic expansion of its products and added additional products and capabilities in
2014. The spending on expansion initiatives, excluding customer acquisition costs which occur prior to premiums being written, contributed approximately 2.7 points to the expense ratio in 2014.
Esurance's annual combined ratio is below 100,
excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets, after the year of policy inception (in which substantially all acquisition costs are incurred), driven by pricing changes and customer mix. We
manage the direct to consumer business based on its profitability over the life-time of the policy.   

         Encompass
brand expense ratio decreased 0.4 points in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower employee related costs, including pension expense, partially offset by higher
amortization of DAC. The Encompass brand DAC amortization is higher on average than Allstate brand DAC amortization due to higher commission rates paid to independent agencies.   

DAC       We establish a DAC asset for costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies,
principally
agents' remuneration and premium taxes. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income over the period in which premiums are earned. The DAC balance as of December 31 by brand
and product type are shown in the following table.   

Gain on disposition    of $37 million, after-tax, in 2014 primarily relates to the sale of Sterling Collision Centers, Inc.   

Catastrophe management     

          Historical catastrophe experience       For the last ten years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our Property-Liability loss ratio was
9.2
points. The average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the last ten years was 32.7 points.   

         Over
time, we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Limitations
include our participation in various state facilities, such as the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), which provides insurance for California earthquake losses; the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe
Fund, which provides reimbursements to participating insurers for certain qualifying Florida hurricane losses; and other state facilities, such as wind pools. However, the impact of these actions may
be diminished by the growth in insured values, and the effect of state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance
facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Because of our
participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools, we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and to assessments from these facilities.   

We
have continued to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, including the
following:  

Continuing to not offer new homeowners business in certain coastal states.           Increased capacity in our brokerage platform for
customers not offered a renewal.           North Light expanded to 9 new states in 2014, bringing the total number of active states to 42.           In Texas we have been ceding wind exposure related to insured property located in wind pool eligible areas along the coast including
the Galveston Islands.           We ceased writing new homeowners business in California in 2007. We continue to renew current policyholders.           We ceased writing new homeowners business in Florida in 2011 beyond a modest stance for existing customers who replace their
currently-insured home with an acceptable property. The Encompass companies operating in Florida withdrew from the property lines in 2009.    
 
  59  

Table of Contents   

Tropical cyclone deductibles are in place for a large portion of coastal insured properties though contract language varies across
states and companies, allowing for these higher deductibles to be triggered differently across our customer base.           We have additional catastrophe exposure, beyond the property lines, for
auto customers who have purchased physical damage coverage.
Auto physical damage coverage generally includes coverage for flood-related loss. We manage this additional exposure through inclusion of auto losses in our nationwide reinsurance program (which
excludes New Jersey and Florida). New Jersey auto losses are included in our New Jersey reinsurance program.           Redesigned our homeowners new business offering, Allstate House and
Home , that provides options of coverage for roof
damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. Allstate House and Home  is currently available in 34 states.    

Hurricanes     

         We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes generally to be major metropolitan centers in counties
along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. Usually, the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than in other areas. However, average premiums are often not
considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss. In addition and as explained in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, in various states Allstate is subject to assessments
from assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations providing insurance for wind related property losses.   

We
have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by, among other actions, purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in
areas most exposed to hurricanes, limiting personal homeowners new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states, implementing tropical cyclone deductibles where appropriate, and
not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states. We continue to seek appropriate returns for the risks we write. This may require further actions, similar to
those already taken, in geographies where we are not getting appropriate returns. However, we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where we achieve adequate returns and do
not materially increase our hurricane risk.   

Earthquakes     

         Actions taken to reduce our exposure from earthquake losses are substantially complete. These actions included purchasing reinsurance
on a countrywide basis and in the state of Kentucky, no longer offering new optional earthquake coverage in most states, removing optional earthquake coverage upon renewal in most states, and entering
into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through other insurers for new and renewal business.   

         We
expect to retain approximately 30,000 PIF with earthquake coverage, primarily in Kentucky, due to regulatory and other reasons. We also will continue to have exposure to earthquake
risk on certain policies that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses, including our auto policies, and to fires following earthquakes. Allstate policyholders in the state of
California are offered coverage through the CEA, a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Allstate is subject to assessments
from the CEA under certain circumstances as explained in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.   

Fires Following Earthquakes     

         Actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in
California, purchasing reinsurance for Kentucky personal lines property risks, and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance, excluding Florida and New Jersey.   

Wildfires     

         Actions we are taking to reduce our risk of loss from wildfires include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in certain states
and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance.

DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT     

           Overview       The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from property-liability insurance coverage that we no longer write and
results
for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment. We have assigned management of this
segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation, exposure identification and reinsurance collection. As part of its responsibilities,
this group may at times be engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations.   

         Summarized
underwriting results for the years ended December 31 are presented in the following table.   

Underwriting
losses of $115 million in 2014 primarily related to our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices resulting in an $87 million
unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, a $15 million unfavorable reestimate of environmental reserves and a $3 million increase in allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance,
partially offset by a $3 million favorable reestimate of other exposure reserves. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $10 million for 2014, $13 million for 2013
and $11 million for 2012.   

         Underwriting
losses of $143 million in 2013 related to a $74 million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, a $30 million unfavorable reestimate of
environmental reserves and a $30 million unfavorable reestimate of other exposure reserves, primarily as a result of our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices,
partially offset by a $1 million decrease in our allowance for future uncollectable reinsurance.   

         The
underwriting loss of $53 million in 2012 related to a $26 million unfavorable reestimate of asbestos reserves, a $22 million unfavorable reestimate of
environmental reserves and a $5 million unfavorable reestimate of other reserves, primarily as a result of our annual review using established industry and actuarial best practices, partially
offset by a $14 million decrease in our allowance for future uncollectable reinsurance.   

         See
the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD A for a more detailed discussion.   

Discontinued Lines and Coverages outlook     

We may continue to experience asbestos and/or environmental losses in the future. These losses could be due to the potential adverse
impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory
actions. Environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site cleanup. Because of our annual review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately
established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations.           We anticipate progress in the resolution of certain bankruptcies related to insureds with asbestos claims,
reducing the industry's
asbestos related claims exposures.           We continue to address challenges related to centralization of insurance and reinsurance industry legacy claims into companies who
specialize in the runoff of this business.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS     

          Net investment income       The following table presents net investment income.   

The
average pre-tax investment yields for the years ended December 31 are presented in the following table. Pre-tax yield is calculated as investment income before investment
expense (including dividend income in the case of equity securities) divided by the average of the investment balances at the end of each quarter during the year. Investment balances, for purposes of
the pre-tax yield calculation, exclude unrealized capital gains and losses.   

Net
investment income decreased 5.4% or $74 million to $1.30 billion in 2014 from $1.38 billion in 2013, after increasing 3.7% in 2013 compared to 2012. The 2014
decrease was primarily due to lower fixed income yields and equity dividends. The decrease in fixed income yields is primarily due to reinvestment at yields lower than the overall portfolio yield. The
2013 increase was primarily due to higher limited partnership income, average investment balances and equity dividends, as well as prepayment fee income and litigation proceeds which together
increased income by a total of $18 million in 2013, partially offset by lower fixed income yields.   

            Net realized capital gains and losses    are presented in the following table.   

For
a further discussion of net realized capital gains and losses, see the Investments section of the MD A.   

PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES     

         Property-Liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability claims and claims expense
reserves. For a description of our reserve process, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in
our reserve estimates, see the   

  62  

Table of Contents   

  Application
of Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD A. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date.   

The
facts and circumstances leading to our reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a
reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are likely different than those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve
estimates. As of December 31, 2014, the impact of a reserve reestimation corresponding to a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately
$112 million in net income available to common shareholders.   

         We
believe the net loss reserves for Allstate Protection exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations.   

         The
table below shows total net reserves as of December 31 by line of business.   

The
tables below show reserves, net of reinsurance, representing the estimated cost of outstanding claims as they were recorded at the beginning of years 2014, 2013 and 2012 and the

2012 Prior year reserve reestimates     

Allstate brand    prior year reserve reestimates were $171 million favorable in 2014, $220 million favorable in 2013, and
$671 million favorable in 2012. In 2014, this was primarily due to severity development that was better than expected. In 2013, this was primarily due to severity development that was better
than expected and catastrophe reserve reestimates. In 2012, this was primarily due to favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates and severity development that was better than expected. The increased
reserves in accident years 2002   prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.   

         These
trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as described above, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period
until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves are revised as
actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations.   

         The
impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting income is shown in the table below.   

Esurance brand       prior year reserve reestimates were $16 million favorable in 2014. In 2014, this was primarily due to severity
development that
was better than expected. There were no prior year reserve reestimates for Esurance in 2013 or 2012. However, the Esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in 2012 resulting in a
$13 million reduction in reserves due to lower severity. The adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase
agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio.   

         The
impact of these reestimates on the Esurance brand underwriting loss is shown in the table below.   

Encompass brand    prior year reserve reestimates were $9 million favorable in 2014, $43 million favorable in 2013, and
$45 million favorable in 2012. In 2014, this was primarily due to severity development that was better than expected. In 2013 and 2012, this was related to lower than anticipated claim
settlement costs and favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates.   

         The
impact of these reestimates on the Encompass brand underwriting (loss) income is shown in the table below.

Auto
reserve reestimates in 2014, 2013, and 2012 were primarily due to claim severity development that was better than expected.   

         Unfavorable
homeowners reserve reestimates in 2014 were primarily due to unfavorable catastrophe reserve reestimates. Favorable homeowners reserve reestimates in 2013 were primarily due
to favorable non-catastrophe reserve reestimates. Favorable homeowners reserve reestimates in 2012 were primarily due to favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates.   

Other
personal lines reserve reestimates in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were primarily the result of non-catastrophe loss development higher than anticipated in previous estimates.   

         Commercial

Discontinued Lines and Coverages       We conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos,
environmental and
other discontinued lines reserves. Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the
regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential
liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by policyholders.   

  67  

Table of Contents   

         Reserve
reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages are shown in the table below.   

Reserve
additions for asbestos in 2014 were primarily related to more reported claims than expected and increased severity including claims from certain large insurance programs. Reserve
additions for asbestos in 2013 were primarily related to a cedent's settlement with a bankrupt insured of asbestos claims in excess of a previously advised amount and loss trends from other claims.
Reserve additions for asbestos in 2012 were primarily for products related coverage due to increases for the assumed reinsurance portion of discontinued lines where we are reliant on our ceding
companies to report claims.   

         Reserve
additions for environmental in 2014 were primarily related to greater reported loss activity than expected. Reserve additions for environmental in 2013 were primarily related to
an adverse court ruling for site-specific disputed coverage. Reserve additions for environmental in 2012 were primarily related to site-specific remediations where the clean-up cost estimates and
responsibility for the clean-up were more fully determined.   

The
table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance for the past three years.

Table of Contents   

         The
survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to
measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount
of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to
vary over time.   

         In
2014 and 2013, the asbestos net 3-year survival ratio decreased due to increased claim payments. The environmental net 3-year survival ratio decreased in 2014 due to increased claim
payments and increased in 2013 due to reserve additions.

net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table.   

During
the last three years, 40 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and claims of 66 policyholders were closed, decreasing the number of active policyholders by
26 during the period. There was a net decrease of 14 in 2014, including 13 new policyholders reporting new claims and the closing of 27 policyholders' claims. There was a net increase of 1 in 2013,
including 12 new policyholders reporting new claims and the closing of 11 policyholders' claims. There was a net decrease of 13 in 2012 including 15 new policyholders reporting new claims and the
closing of 28 policyholders' claims.   

         IBNR
net reserves increased $3 million as of December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014 IBNR represented 57% of total net
asbestos reserves, compared to 56% as of December 31, 2013. IBNR provides for reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current policyholders
and ceding companies.   

         Pending,
new, total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended December 31 are summarized in the following table.

           Property-Liability reinsurance ceded       For Allstate Protection, we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage
capital, and
to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as Castle Key Insurance Company and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company. We
purchase significant reinsurance to manage our aggregate countrywide exposure to an acceptable level. The price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the
purchase process, along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders. We also participate in various
reinsurance mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, which are backed by the financial resources of the property-liability insurance company market participants, and have historically
purchased reinsurance to mitigate long-tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks
ceded to reinsurers. The Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association provides indemnification for losses over a retention level and under the National Flood Insurance Program the Federal Government pays
all covered claims.   

         Our
reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table as of December 31, net of the allowance we have established for uncollectible amounts.   

(1)     N/A
reflects no rating available.       (2)     As
of December 31, 2014 and 2013, MCCA includes $32 million and $29 million of reinsurance recoverable on paid claims,
respectively, and $4.39 billion and $3.43 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims, respectively.    

Reinsurance
recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that are ceded under the terms of the reinsurance
agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. We calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement, including an estimate of how
IBNR losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement.
We also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, our estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our
estimate of reserves for property-liability claims and claims expense. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount
ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded   

  70  

Table of Contents   

if
needed. The establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. Changes in estimates could
result in additional changes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

         The
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance primarily relates to Discontinued Lines and Coverages reinsurance recoverables and was $95 million and $92 million as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The allowance for Discontinued Lines and Coverages represents 12.9% and 12.6% of the related reinsurance recoverable balances as of December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors. In
addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against
such reinsurers to determine the parties' rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. We employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. We also
consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers in seeking to
maximize our reinsurance recoveries.   

         Adverse
developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future
claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. There has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer
companies. In addition, some companies have segregated asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain
cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectability of reinsurance recoverables in the future.   

         For
a detailed description of the MCCA, NJUCJF and Lloyd's, see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2014, other than the recoverable
balances listed in the table above, no other amount due or estimated to be due from any single Property-Liability reinsurer was in excess of $21 million.   

         The
effects of reinsurance ceded on our property-liability premiums earned and claims and claims expense for the years ended December 31 are summarized in the following table.   

In
2014, ceded property-liability premiums earned decreased $39 million compared to 2013, primarily due to decreased reinsurance premium rates and acquiring additional reinsurance
in the capital markets. In 2013, ceded property-liability premiums earned decreased $21 million compared to 2012, primarily due to decreased premium rates, acquiring reinsurance in the capital
markets and lower limits placed in our catastrophe reinsurance program, partially offset by higher MCCA reinsurance premiums due to an increase in policies written in Michigan. MCCA ceded premiums
were $99 million, $101 million and $78 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

         Ceded
property-liability claims and claims expense decreased in 2014 primarily due to lower amounts ceded to the national Flood Insurance Program and lower reserve increases for the
NJUCJF program. Ceded property-liability claims and claims expense decreased in 2013 primarily due to lower amounts ceded to the National Flood Insurance Program, partially offset by reserve increases
for the NJUCJF program.

         Our
claim reserve development experience is similar to the MCCA with reported and pending claims increasing in recent years. Moreover, the MCCA has reported severity increasing with
nearly 60% of reimbursements for attendant and residential care services. Michigan's unique no-fault auto insurance law provides unlimited lifetime coverage for medical expenses resulting from vehicle
accidents. The reserve increases in the MCCA program are attributable to an increased recognition of longer term paid loss trends. The paid loss trends are rising due to increased costs in medical and
attendant care and increased longevity of claimants.   

         The
table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for Michigan personal injury protection claims before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of MCCA reinsurance for the years ended
December 31.   

(1)     Reserves
for the year ended December 31, 2014 comprise 86% case reserves (claims with a file review conducted) and 14% IBNR. Reserves
for the year ended December 31, 2013 comprise 66% case reserves and 34% IBNR.       (2)     Paid
claims and claims expenses, reported in the table for the current and prior year, recovered from the MCCA totaled $88 million,
$88 million and $86 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.    

Pending
MCCA claims differ from most personal lines insurance pending claims as other personal lines policies have coverage limits and incurred claims settle in shorter periods. Claims
are considered pending as long as payments are continuing pursuant to an outstanding MCCA claim, which can be for a claimant's lifetime. Claims that occurred more than 5 years ago and
continuing to be paid often include lifetime benefits. Pending, new and closed claims for Michigan personal injury protection exposures, including those covered and not covered by the MCCA
reinsurance, for the years ended December 31 are summarized in the following table.   

As
of December 31, 2014, approximately 1,100 of our pending claims have been reported to the MCCA, of which approximately 75% represents claims that occurred more than 5 years
ago. There are 68 Allstate brand claims with reserves in excess of $15 million as of December 31, 2014 which comprise approximately 40% of the gross ending reserves in the table above.   

         The
reserve increases in the NJUCJF program in 2014 and 2013 are attributable to unlimited personal injury protection coverage on policies written prior to 1991. The ceded claims
reflects increased longer term paid loss trends due to increased costs of medical care and increased longevity of claimants. New claims for this cohort of policies are unlikely and pending claims are
expected to decline.   

         We
enter into certain intercompany insurance and reinsurance transactions for the Property-Liability operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among
various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   

Catastrophe reinsurance     

         Our catastrophe reinsurance program is designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes
nationwide. Our program is designed to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, tornados, fires following earthquakes, earthquakes and wildfires. These   

  72  

Table of Contents   

  reinsurance
agreements are part of our catastrophe management strategy, which is intended to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business, and to reduce
variability of earnings, while providing protection to our customers.   

         We
anticipate completing the placement of our 2015 catastrophe reinsurance program in the second quarter of 2015. We expect the program will be similar to our 2014 catastrophe
reinsurance program. For further details of the existing 2014 program, see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.   

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2014 HIGHLIGHTS     

Net income available to common shareholders was $631 million in 2014 compared to $95 million in 2013.           Premiums and
contract charges on underwritten products, including traditional life, interest-sensitive life and accident and health
insurance, totaled $2.13 billion in 2014, a decrease of 7.1% from $2.30 billion in 2013.           Investments totaled $38.81 billion as of December 31, 2014, reflecting a
decrease of $296 million from
$39.11 billion as of December 31, 2013. Investments as of December 31, 2013 excluded LBL investments classified as held for sale. Net investment income decreased 16.0% to
$2.13 billion in 2014 from $2.54 billion in 2013.           Net realized capital gains totaled $144 million in 2014 compared to $74 million in 2013.           Contractholder funds totaled $22.53 billion as of December 31, 2014, reflecting a decrease of $1.77 billion from
$24.30 billion as of December 31, 2013. Contractholder funds as of December 31, 2013 excluded LBL amounts classified as held for sale.           On April 1, 2014, we sold
LBL's life insurance business generated through independent master brokerage agencies,
and all of LBL's deferred fixed annuity and long-term care insurance business to Resolution Life Holdings, Inc. The loss on disposition increased by $60 million, after-tax
in 2014. Most of the amount in 2014 represents non-cash charges.    

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT     

          Overview and strategy       The Allstate Financial segment sells traditional, interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and voluntary accident
and
health insurance products. We serve our customers through Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists, and workplace enrolling independent agents. We previously offered and
continue to have in force fixed annuities such as deferred and immediate annuities, and institutional products consisting of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back
medium-term notes. Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists have a portfolio of non-proprietary products to sell, including mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities,
disability insurance and long-term care insurance, to help meet customer needs.   

Allstate
Financial brings value to The Allstate Corporation in three principal ways: through profitable growth, by bringing new customers to Allstate, and by improving the economics of
the Protection business through increased customer loyalty and stronger customer relationships based on cross selling Allstate Financial products to existing customers. Allstate Financial's strategy
is focused on expanding Allstate customer relationships, growing the number of products delivered to customers through Allstate exclusive agencies and Allstate Benefits (our workplace distribution
business), managing the run-off of our in-force annuity products while taking actions to improve returns, and emphasizing capital efficiency and shareholder returns.   

Our
strategy for our life insurance business centers on the continuation of our efforts to fully integrate the business into the Allstate brand customer value proposition and modernizing
our operating model. The life insurance product portfolio and sales process are being redesigned with a focus on clear and distinct positioning to meet the varied needs of Allstate customers. Our
product positioning will provide solutions to help meet customer needs during various life stages ranging from basic mortality protection to more complex mortality and financial planning solutions.
Basic mortality protection solutions will be provided through less complex products, such as term and whole life insurance, sold through exclusive agents and licensed sales professionals to deepen
customer relationships. More advanced mortality and financial planning solutions will be provided primarily through exclusive financial specialists with an emphasis on our more complex offerings, such
as universal life insurance products. Sales producer education and technology improvements are being made to ensure agencies have the tools and information needed to help customers meet their needs
and build personal relationships as trusted advisors. Additionally, tools will be made available to consumers to help them understand their needs and encourage interaction with their local agencies.   

         Our
employer relationships through Allstate Benefits also afford opportunities to offer Allstate products to more customers and grow our business. Allstate Benefits is an industry leader
in the voluntary benefits market, offering a broad range of products, including critical illness, accident, cancer, hospital indemnity, disability and universal life. Allstate Benefits differentiates
itself by offering a broad product portfolio, flexible enrollment solutions and technology   

  73  

Table of Contents   

  (including
significant presence on private exchanges), and its strong national accounts team, as well as the well-recognized Allstate brand.   

Market
trends for voluntary benefits are favorable as the market has nearly doubled in size since 2006, driven by the ability of voluntary benefits to fill gaps from employers seeking to
contain rising health care costs, by providing lower cost benefits, and shifting costs to employees. Allstate Benefits has introduced new products and enhanced existing products to address these gaps
by providing protection for catastrophic events such as a critical illness, accident or hospital stay. Originally a provider of voluntary benefits to small and mid-sized businesses, Allstate Benefits
now provides benefit solutions to companies of all sizes and industries including the large account voluntary benefits marketplace.   

Allstate
Benefits's strategy for growth includes expansion in the national accounts market by increasing the number of sales, enrollment technology and account management personnel and
expanding independent agent distribution in targeted geographic locations for increased new sales. Additionally, we are increasing Allstate exclusive agency engagement to drive cross selling of
voluntary benefits products, and developing opportunities for revenue growth through new product and fee income offerings. Allstate Benefits new business written premiums increased 5.0% and 9.4% in
2014 and 2013, respectively. Allstate Benefits also plans to expand into the Canadian market in 2015.   

         Our
in-force deferred and immediate annuity business has been adversely impacted by the credit cycle and historically low interest rate environment. Our immediate annuity business has
also been impacted by medical advancements that have resulted in annuitants living longer than anticipated when many of these contracts were originated. We focus on the distinct risk and return
profiles of the specific products outstanding when developing investment and liability management strategies. We have significantly reduced the level of legacy deferred annuities in force and
proactively manage the investment portfolio and annuity crediting rates to improve the profitability of the business. We are managing the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities to
ensure the assets match the characteristics of the liabilities and provide the long-term returns needed to support this business. We continue to increase investments in which we have ownership
interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic operating or market performance, including limited partnerships, equities and real estate, to more appropriately match the
long-term nature of our immediate annuities. To transition our annuity business to a more efficient variable cost structure, we plan to outsource the administration of the business to a third party
administration company in 2015.   

Allstate Financial outlook     

Our growth initiatives continue to focus on increasing the number of customers served through our proprietary Allstate agency and
Allstate Benefits channels.           We expect lower investment spread due to the continuing managed reduction in contractholder funds and the low interest rate
environment.           We will continue to focus on improving returns on our in-force annuity products and managing the impacts of historically low interest
rates. We anticipate a continuation of our asset allocation strategy for long-term immediate annuities to have less reliance on investments whose returns come primarily from interest payments to
investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic operating or market performance, including limited partnerships, equities and real
estate. This shift could result in lower and more volatile investment income; however, we anticipate that this strategy will lead to higher long-term total returns on attributed equity.          
Allstate Financial has limitations on the amount of dividends Allstate Financial companies can pay without prior insurance department
approval. Accordingly, the level of distributions in 2015 may be lower than 2014.           We continue to review our strategic options to reduce our exposure and improve returns of the
spread-based businesses. As a result, we
may take additional operational and financial actions that offer return improvement and risk reduction opportunities.

          Summary analysis       Summarized financial data for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table.   

Net income available to common shareholders    was $631 million in 2014 compared to $95 million in 2013. The increase primarily
relates to lower loss on disposition charges related to the LBL sale, partially offset by the reduction in business due to the sale of LBL on April 1, 2014. Net income available to common
shareholders in 2014 and 2013 included an after-tax loss on disposition of LBL totaling $60 million and $521 million, respectively. Excluding the loss on disposition as well as the net
income of the LBL business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $116 million, net income available to common shareholders increased $191 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily
due to lower interest credited to contractholder funds, higher net realized capital gains, lower operating costs and expenses, lower amortization of DAC, and higher life and annuity premiums and
contract charges, partially offset by higher life and annuity contract benefits and lower net investment income.   

         Net
income available to common shareholders was $95 million in 2013 compared to $541 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the estimated loss on disposition
related to the pending LBL sale, lower net investment income and higher life and annuity contract benefits, partially offset by higher life and annuity premiums and contract charges, net realized
capital gains in 2013 compared to net realized capital losses in 2012 and decreased amortization of DAC.   

           Analysis of revenues       Total revenues decreased 10.7% or $532 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL business for
second
through fourth quarter 2013 of $651 million, total revenues increased 2.8% or $119 million in 2014 compared to 2013, due to higher net realized capital gains and higher life and annuity
premiums and contract charges, partially offset by lower net investment income. Total revenues increased 1.8% or $89 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to higher life and annuity
premiums and contract charges and net realized capital gains in 2013 compared to net realized capital losses in 2012, partially offset by lower net investment income.   

           Life and annuity premiums and contract charges       Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life insurance, immediate annuities
with life
contingencies, and accident and health insurance products that have significant   

  75  

Table of Contents   

  mortality
or morbidity risk. Contract charges are revenues generated from interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and fixed annuities for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds
or separate account liabilities. Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually
specified dates.   

         The
following table summarizes life and annuity premiums and contract charges by product for the years ended December 31.   

(1)     Contract
charges related to the cost of insurance totaled $593 million, $725 million and $696 million in 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively.    

Total
premiums and contract charges decreased 8.3% or $195 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of
$254 million, premiums and contract charges increased $59 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to growth in Allstate Benefits accident and health insurance business and
increased traditional life insurance premiums due to higher renewals and sales through Allstate agencies, partially offset by lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies due to
discontinuing new sales January 1, 2014. The growth at Allstate Benefits primarily relates to accident and critical illness products and an increase in the number of employer groups.   

Total
premiums and contract charges increased 5.0% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to growth in Allstate Benefits accident and health insurance business, higher contract charges
on interest-sensitive life insurance products primarily resulting from the aging of our policyholders and growth of insurance in force, and increased traditional life insurance premiums due to lower
reinsurance premiums ceded and higher sales and renewals through Allstate agencies, partially offset by lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies.   

         Allstate
agencies and exclusive financial specialists continue to sell LBL life products until Allstate Financial transitions these products to Allstate Assurance Company beginning first
quarter 2015. LBL life business sold through the Allstate agency channel and all LBL payout annuity business continues to be reinsured and serviced by Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC").
Following the closing of the sale, LBL was rated A- from A.M. Best and BBB+ from Standard   Poor's ("S P"). ALIC is rated A+ by A.M. Best, A+ by S P and A1 by Moody's. Allstate
Assurance Company is rated A by A.M. Best and A1 by Moody's. As of December 31, 2014, ALIC assumed from LBL $3.82 billion of reserves for life-contingent contract benefits and
contractholder funds. In 2014, life and annuity premiums and contract charges of $784 million, contract benefits of $487 million, and interest credited to contractholder funds of
$166 million were assumed from LBL. Allstate will continue to service the LBL business that was sold until the servicing transitions to third party administration companies, which have
experienced delays and are expected to be completed in 2015.   

            Contractholder funds    represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life insurance,
fixed annuities and funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract benefits,
surrenders, withdrawals,

Table of Contents   

  maturities
and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. The following table shows the changes in contractholder funds for the years ended December 31.   

(1)     The
table above illustrates the changes in contractholder funds, which are presented gross of reinsurance recoverables on the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. The table above is intended to supplement our discussion and analysis of revenues, which are presented net of reinsurance on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. As a result, the net change in contractholder funds associated with products reinsured to third parties is reflected as a component of the other adjustments line.    

Contractholder
funds decreased 7.3% in 2014 due to no longer offering fixed annuity products beginning January 1, 2014. Contractholder funds decreased 38.2% in 2013 reflecting the
reclassification of contractholder funds held for sale relating to the LBL sale. Contractholder funds, including those classified as held for sale, decreased 10.4% in 2013, reflecting a large
institutional product maturity in 2013 and our continuing strategy to reduce our concentration in spread-based products.   

Contractholder
deposits decreased 45.4% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to no longer offering fixed annuity products beginning January 1, 2014, as well as lower deposits
on interest-sensitive life insurance due to the LBL sale. Contractholder deposits increased 7.3% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to increased fixed annuity deposits driven by the new
equity-indexed annuity products and higher deposits on immediate annuities, as well as higher deposits on interest-sensitive life insurance.   

         Surrenders
and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products decreased 31.1% to $2.27 billion in 2014 from $3.30 billion in
2013, primarily due to the LBL sale. Surrenders and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products decreased 17.3% to $3.30 billion in 2013 from
$3.99 billion in 2012. The surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products, based on the beginning of year contractholder funds,
was 9.9% in 2014 compared to 10.2% in 2013 and 11.3% in 2012.   

         Maturities
of and interest payments on institutional products included a $1.75 billion maturity in 2013. There are $85 million of institutional products outstanding as of
December 31, 2014.   

            Net investment income    decreased 16.0% or $407 million to $2.13 billion in 2014 from $2.54 billion in 2013. Excluding
results of the LBL business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $397 million, net investment income decreased   

  77  

Table of Contents   

  $10 million
in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower average investment balances, partially offset by higher limited partnership income. Net investment income decreased 4.1% or
$109 million to $2.54 billion in 2013 from $2.65 billion in 2012, primarily due to lower average investment balances, partially offset by higher prepayment fee income and
litigation proceeds which together increased income by a total of $50 million in 2013 and higher limited partnership income. The average pre-tax investment yields were 5.6% for 2014 and 5.1%
for both 2013 and 2012.   

Net realized capital gains and losses    for the years ended December 31 are presented in the following table.   

For
further discussion of realized capital gains and losses, see the Investments section of the MD A.   

           Analysis of costs and expenses       Total costs and expenses decreased 16.7% or $683 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of
the LBL
business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $475 million, total costs and expenses decreased $208 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower interest credited to
contractholder funds, lower operating costs and expenses and lower amortization of DAC, partially offset by higher life and annuity contract benefits. Total costs and expenses decreased 0.4% or
$16 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower amortization of DAC and interest credited to contractholder funds, partially offset by higher life and annuity contract benefits.   

            Life and annuity contract benefits    decreased 7.9% or $152 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL business
for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $173 million, life and annuity contract benefits increased $21 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to worse mortality experience on
life insurance and growth at Allstate Benefits. Our 2014 annual review of assumptions resulted in an $11 million increase in reserves primarily for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive
life insurance due to increased projected exposure to secondary guarantees.   

         Life
and annuity contract benefits increased 5.4% or $99 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in reserves for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive
life insurance, growth at Allstate Benefits and worse mortality experience on life insurance. Our 2013 annual review of assumptions resulted in a $37 million increase in reserves primarily for
secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance due to higher concentration of and increased projected exposure to secondary guarantees.   

We
analyze our mortality and morbidity results using the difference between premiums and contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and life and annuity contract benefits
excluding the portion related to the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies ("benefit spread"). This implied interest totaled $521 million, $527 million and
$538 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

spread increased 4.3% or $25 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $11 million, benefit
spread increased $36 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to growth in Allstate Benefits accident and health insurance and higher premiums and cost of insurance contract charges on
life insurance, partially offset by worse mortality experience on life insurance and immediate annuities.   

Benefit
spread decreased 0.2% or $1 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the increase in reserves for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance and
worse mortality experience on life insurance and annuities, partially offset by premium growth in Allstate Benefits accident and health insurance and higher cost of insurance contract charges on
interest-sensitive life insurance.   

            Interest credited to contractholder funds    decreased 28.1% or $359 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL
business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $270 million, interest credited to contractholder funds decreased $89 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower average
contractholder funds and lower interest crediting rates. Interest credited to contractholder funds decreased 2.9% or $38 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower average
contractholder funds and lower interest crediting rates, partially offset by the valuation change on derivatives embedded in equity-indexed annuity contracts that reduced interest credited expense in
2012. Valuation changes on derivatives embedded in equity-indexed annuity contracts that are not hedged increased interest credited to contractholder funds by $22 million in 2014 compared to a
$24 million increase in 2013 and a $126 million decrease in 2012. During third quarter 2012, we reviewed the significant valuation inputs for these embedded derivatives and reduced the
projected option cost to reflect management's current and anticipated crediting rate setting actions, which were informed by the existing and projected low interest rate environment and are consistent
with our strategy to reduce exposure to spread-based business. The reduction in projected interest rates resulted in a reduction of contractholder funds and interest credited expense by
$169 million in 2012.   

         In
order to analyze the impact of net investment income and interest credited to contractholders on net income, we monitor the difference between net investment income and the sum of
interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies, which is included as a component of life and annuity contract benefits on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations ("investment spread").

The
investment spread by product group for the years ended December 31 is shown in the following table.   

Investment
spread before valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged decreased 5.8% or $44 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL
business for the second through fourth quarter of 2013 of $149 million, investment spread before valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged increased $105 million in
2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher limited partnership income, higher fixed income yields and lower crediting rates, partially offset by the continued managed reduction in our spread-based
business in force. Investment spread before valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged increased 13.5% or $90 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower
crediting rates, higher prepayment fee income and litigation proceeds and higher limited partnership income, partially offset by the continued managed reduction in our spread-based business in force.   

         To
further analyze investment spreads, the following table summarizes the weighted average investment yield on assets supporting product liabilities and capital, interest crediting rates
and investment spreads. For purposes of these calculations, investments, reserves and contractholder funds classified as held for sale were included for periods prior to April 1, 2014.

(1)     The
impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of DAC is dependent upon the relationship between the assets that give rise to
the gain or loss and the product liability supported by the assets. Fluctuations result from changes in the impact of realized capital gains and losses on actual and expected gross profits.    

Amortization
of DAC decreased 20.7% or $68 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL business for second through fourth quarter 2013 of $1 million,
amortization of DAC decreased $67 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to amortization deceleration for changes in assumptions in 2014 compared to amortization acceleration in 2013,
partially offset by higher amortization on accident and health insurance resulting from growth.   

Amortization
of DAC decreased 18.2% or $73 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the absence of amortization on a large fixed annuity block that became fully
amortized in 2012, lower amortization relating to valuation changes on derivatives embedded in equity-indexed annuity contracts due to a large valuation change in 2012, lower amortization on
interest-sensitive life insurance resulting from decreased benefit spread, and lower amortization acceleration for changes in assumptions.   

         Our
annual comprehensive review of assumptions underlying estimated future gross profits for our interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts covers
assumptions for persistency, mortality, expenses, investment returns, including capital gains and losses, interest crediting rates to policyholders, and the
effect of any hedges in all product lines. In 2014, the review resulted in a deceleration of DAC amortization (credit to income) of $8 million. Amortization deceleration of $10 million
related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was primarily due to a   

  81  

Table of Contents   

  decrease
in projected expenses, partially offset by increased projected mortality. Amortization acceleration of $2 million related to fixed annuities and was primarily due to a decrease in
projected gross profits.   

         In
2013, the review resulted in an acceleration of DAC amortization (charge to income) of $23 million. Amortization acceleration of $38 million related to
interest-sensitive life insurance and was primarily due to an increase in projected mortality and expenses, partially offset by increased projected investment margins. Amortization deceleration of
$12 million related to fixed annuities and was primarily due to an increase in projected investment margins. Amortization deceleration of $3 million related to variable life insurance.   

         In
2012, the review resulted in an acceleration of DAC amortization of $34 million. Amortization acceleration of $38 million related to variable life insurance and was
primarily due to an increase in projected mortality. Amortization acceleration of $4 million related to fixed annuities and was primarily due to lower projected investment returns. Amortization
deceleration of $8 million related to interest-sensitive life insurance and was primarily due to an increase in projected persistency.   

The
changes in DAC for the years ended December 31 are detailed in the following table.   

(1)     Included
as a component of amortization of DAC on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.       (2)     Represents
the change in the DAC adjustment for unrealized capital gains and losses. The DAC adjustment represents the amount by which the
amortization of DAC would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains and losses in the respective product portfolios were realized.    

Operating costs and expenses    decreased 17.5% or $99 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding results of the LBL business for
second through fourth quarter 2013 of $31 million, operating costs and expenses decreased $68 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Operating costs and expenses decreased 1.9% or
$11 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses for the years ended December 31.   

General
and administrative expenses decreased 21.1% or $84 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to actions to improve strategic focus and modernize the operating model.
This included the sale of LBL, exiting the master   

  82  

Table of Contents   

  brokerage
agency distribution channel, discontinuing sales of proprietary annuity products, and other rightsizing and profitability actions.   

         General
and administrative expenses decreased 5.5% or $23 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower employee related expenses and proceeds received from a
litigation settlement.   

            Loss on disposition    of $90 million in 2014 and $687 million in 2013 include $101 million and $698 million of
losses relating to the LBL sale, respectively. Gain on disposition of $18 million in 2012 related to the amortization of the deferred gain from the disposition through reinsurance of
substantially all of our variable annuity business in 2006, and the sale of Surety Life Insurance Company, which was not used for new business, in third quarter 2012.   

           Reinsurance ceded       We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers to limit our risk of mortality and morbidity losses. In
addition,
Allstate Financial has used reinsurance to effect the disposition of certain blocks of business. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers. As of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, 23% and 36%, respectively, of our face amount of life insurance in force was reinsured. Additionally, we ceded substantially all of the risk associated with our
variable annuity business.   

         Our
reinsurance recoverables, summarized by reinsurer as of December 31, are shown in the following table.   

(1)     The
Company has extensive reinsurance contracts directly with Swiss Re and its affiliates and indirectly through Swiss Re's acquisition of
other companies with whom we had reinsurance or retrocession contracts.       (2)     As
of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the other category includes $44 million and $58 million, respectively, of recoverables
due from reinsurers with an investment grade credit rating from Standard   Poor's ("S P").       (3)     Reinsurance
recoverables classified as held for sale were $1.66 billion as of December 31, 2013.       (4)     N/A
reflects no rating available.    

We
continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision for uncollectible
reinsurance is recorded if needed. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three-years ended December 31, 2014.   

         We
enter into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal
entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

INVESTMENTS 2014 HIGHLIGHTS     

Investments totaled $81.11 billion as of December 31, 2014, decreasing from $81.16 billion as of
December 31, 2013.           Unrealized net capital gains totaled $3.17 billion as of December 31, 2014, increasing from $2.70 billion as of
December 31, 2013.           Net investment income was $3.46 billion in 2014, a decrease of 12.3% from $3.94 billion in 2013.           Net realized capital gains were $694 million in 2014 compared to $594 million in 2013.    

INVESTMENTS     

           Overview and strategy       The return on our investment portfolios is an important component of our financial results. Investment portfolios are
segmented
between the Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. While taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate, we manage the underlying portfolios based
upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure.   

         We
employ a strategic asset allocation approach which considers the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances, as well as the risk and return parameters of the various asset classes
in which we invest. This asset allocation is informed by our global economic and market outlook, as well as other inputs and constraints, including diversification effects, duration, liquidity and
capital considerations. Within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation, tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions. We manage risks associated
with interest rates, credit spreads, equity markets, real estate and currency exchange rates. Our continuing focus is to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of
market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects. We expect to more actively manage the portfolio and are developing strategies focused on the intermediate 3 to 5 year
investment horizon. Intermediate strategies may include opportunities arising from market dislocations, event driven changes in valuation, and distressed credit. We expect these strategies to perform
well across market conditions, including periods of increased market volatility. We are continuing to build our capabilities and investments in private equity, real estate and limited partnerships
which have returns less correlated to the public markets. These investments typically have a longer term return horizon, generally five to twelve years.   

         The
Property-Liability portfolio's investment strategy emphasizes protection of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. This approach, which has
produced competitive returns over the long term, is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth.   

The
Allstate Financial portfolio's investment strategy focuses on the total return of assets needed to support the underlying liabilities, asset-liability management and achieving an
appropriate return on capital.   

         The
Corporate and Other portfolio's investment strategy balances the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio in relation to the overall corporate capital structure with the pursuit of
returns.   

Investments outlook     

         Interest rates diverged in 2014: U.S. Treasury rates shorter than one year were largely unchanged, rates between 1 year and
3 years increased slightly, and rates 7 years and longer declined and experienced the most significant change during the year. We anticipate that interest rates may remain below historic
averages for an extended period of time and that financial markets will continue to have periods of high volatility. Invested assets and income are expected to decline in line with reductions in
contractholder funds for the Allstate Financial segment. Additionally, income will decline as we continue to invest and reinvest proceeds at market yields that are below the current portfolio yield.
We plan to focus on the following priorities:  

Managing our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a shorter maturity profile in the Property-Liability portfolio which will
also result in the yield responding more quickly to changes in market interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile.           Shifting the portfolio mix over time to have less
reliance on investments whose returns come primarily from interest payments to
investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic operating or market performance, including limited partnerships, equities and real
estate. While we anticipate higher returns on these investments over time, the investment income will be more volatile than interest-bearing investments.           Investing to the specific needs
and characteristics of Allstate's businesses.

Table of Contents   

Portfolio composition       The composition of the investment portfolios as of December 31, 2014 is presented in the following table.

(1)     Fixed
income securities are carried at fair value. Amortized cost basis for these securities was $30.43 billion, $26.74 billion,
$2.50 billion and $59.67 billion for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial, Corporate and Other, and in Total, respectively.       (2)     Equity
securities are carried at fair value. Cost basis for these securities was $2.72 billion, $969 million and
$3.69 billion for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and in Total, respectively.       (3)     We
have commitments to invest in additional limited partnership interests totaling $1.21 billion, $1.22 billion and
$2.43 billion for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and in Total, respectively.       (4)     Short-term
investments are carried at fair value. Amortized cost basis for these investments was $822 million, $1.03 billion,
$692 million and $2.54 billion for Property-Liability, Allstate Financial, Corporate and Other, and in Total, respectively.       (5)     Balances
reflect the elimination of related party investments between segments.    

Total
investments decreased to $81.11 billion as of December 31, 2014, from $81.16 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to common share repurchases,
debt repayments and the reclassification of tax credit funds from limited partnership interests to other assets, partially offset by positive operating cash flows, proceeds from the issuance of
preferred stock and favorable fixed income valuations resulting from a decrease in risk-free interest rates.   

         The
Property-Liability investment portfolio decreased to $39.08 billion as of December 31, 2014, from $39.64 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to
dividends and stock repurchase paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation (the "Corporation") and the reclassification of tax credit funds from limited partnership
interests to other assets, partially offset by positive operating cash flows and a $700 million return of capital paid by ALIC to AIC.   

The
Allstate Financial investment portfolio decreased to $38.81 billion as of December 31, 2014, from $39.11 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to
net reductions in contractholder funds, a $700 million return of capital paid by ALIC to AIC and the reclassification of tax credit funds from limited partnership interests to other assets,
partially offset by higher fixed income valuations.   

         The
Corporate and Other investment portfolio increased to $3.22 billion as of December 31, 2014, from $2.41 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to
dividends and stock repurchase paid by AIC and other affiliates to the Corporation and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by common share repurchases, debt repayments and
dividends paid to shareholders.   

         During
2014, strategic actions focused on optimizing portfolio yield, return and risk in the low interest rate environment. In the Property-Liability portfolio, we maintained the shorter
duration profile of our fixed income securities established in 2013. This positioning has reduced our exposure to rising interest rates. We are increasing our real estate and limited partnership
investments in both the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, consistent with our ongoing strategy to have a greater proportion of ownership of assets and equity investments. In
Allstate Financial's portfolio, limited partnerships and other equity investments will continue to be allocated primarily to the longer-duration immediate annuity liabilities to improve returns on
those products. Shorter-duration annuity and life insurance liabilities will continue to be invested primarily in interest-bearing investments, such as fixed income securities and commercial mortgage
loans.

Table of Contents   

            Fixed income securities    by type are listed in the following table.   

As
of December 31, 2014, 89.3% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or
Baa from Moody's, a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S P, Fitch, Dominion, Kroll or Realpoint, a rating of aaa, aa, a or bbb from A.M. Best, or a comparable internal rating if an externally
provided rating is not available. All of our fixed income securities are rated by third party credit rating agencies, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and/or are internally rated.
Our initial investment decisions and ongoing monitoring procedures for fixed income securities are based on a thorough due diligence process which includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the
credit quality, sector, structure, and liquidity risks of each issue.   

         The
following table summarizes the fair value and unrealized net capital gains and losses for fixed income securities by credit rating as of December 31, 2014.   

Municipal bonds   , including tax exempt and taxable securities, totaled $8.50 billion as of December 31, 2014 with an
unrealized net capital gain of $620 million. The municipal bond portfolio includes general obligations of state and local   

  86  

Table of Contents   

  issuers
and revenue bonds (including pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest).   

The
following table summarizes by state the fair value, amortized cost and credit rating of our municipal bonds, excluding $384 million of pre-refunded bonds, as of
December 31, 2014.   

(1)     The
nature of the activities supporting revenue bonds is diversified and includes transportation, health care, industrial development,
housing, higher education, utilities, recreation/convention centers and other activities.    

Our
practice for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds is predominantly based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor. We currently rely on the primary obligor to pay
all contractual cash flows and are not relying on bond insurers for payments. As a result of downgrades in the insurers' credit ratings, the ratings of the insured municipal bonds generally reflect
the underlying ratings of the primary obligor. As of December 31, 2014, 99.7% of our insured municipal bond portfolio is rated investment grade.   

            Corporate bonds   , including publicly traded and privately placed, totaled $42.14 billion as of December 31, 2014, with an
unrealized net capital gain of $1.76 billion. Privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are directly negotiated with the borrower or are in
unregistered form.   

         Our
$10.59 billion portfolio of privately placed securities is diversified by issuer, industry sector and country. The portfolio is made up of 431 issuers. Privately placed
corporate obligations contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or
fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities. Additionally, investments in these securities are made after due diligence of the issuer, typically
including direct discussions with senior management and on-site visits to company facilities. Ongoing monitoring includes direct periodic dialog with senior management of the issuer and continuous
monitoring of operating performance and financial position. Every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation at least once a year.   

            Foreign government    securities totaled $1.65 billion as of December 31, 2014, with 100% rated investment grade and an
unrealized net capital gain of $102 million. Of these securities, 52.0% are in Canadian governmental and provincial securities (41.3% of which are held by our Canadian companies), 23.8% are
backed by the U.S. government and the remaining 24.2% are highly diversified in other foreign governments.   

ABS, RMBS and CMBS    are structured securities that are primarily collateralized by consumer or corporate borrowings and residential and
commercial real estate loans. The cash flows from the underlying collateral paid to
the securitization trust are generally applied in a pre-determined order and are designed so that each security issued by the trust, typically referred to as a "class", qualifies for a specific
original rating. For example, the "senior" portion or "top" of the capital structure, or rating class, which would originally qualify for a rating of Aaa typically has priority in receiving principal
repayments on the underlying collateral and retains this priority until the class is paid in full. In a sequential structure, underlying collateral principal repayments are directed to the most senior
rated Aaa class in the structure until paid in full, after which principal repayments are directed to the next most senior Aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full. Senior Aaa classes
generally share any losses from the underlying collateral on a pro-rata basis after losses are absorbed by classes with lower original ratings. The payment priority and class subordination included in
these   

  87  

Table of Contents   

  securities
serves as credit enhancement for holders of the senior or top portions of the structures. These securities continue to retain the payment priority features that existed at the origination
of the securitization trust. Other forms of credit enhancement may include structural features embedded in the securitization trust, such as overcollateralization, excess spread and bond insurance.
The underlying collateral can have fixed interest rates, variable interest rates (such as adjustable rate mortgages) or may contain features of both fixed and variable rate mortgages.   

            ABS   , including CDO and Consumer and other ABS, totaled $3.98 billion as of December 31, 2014, with 95.8% rated investment
grade and an unrealized net capital gain of $7 million. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the underlying collateral. Many of the securities in the ABS portfolio have
credit enhancement with features such as overcollateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees and/or insurance.   

CDO
totaled $1.15 billion as of December 31, 2014, with 87.3% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital loss of $16 million. CDO consist of obligations
collateralized by cash flow CDO, which are structures collateralized primarily by below investment grade senior secured corporate loans.   

         Consumer
and other ABS totaled $2.83 billion as of December 31, 2014, with 99.2% rated investment grade. Consumer and other ABS consists of $1.28 billion of consumer
auto, $678 million of credit card and $870 million of other ABS with unrealized net capital gains of $1 million, $2 million and $20 million, respectively.   

RMBS    totaled $1.21 billion as of December 31, 2014, with 31.9% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of
$99 million. The RMBS portfolio is subject to interest rate risk, but unlike other fixed income securities, is additionally subject to prepayment risk from the underlying residential mortgage
loans. RMBS consists of a U.S. Agency portfolio having collateral issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and a non-agency portfolio consisting of securities collateralized by Prime, Alt-A
and Subprime loans. The non-agency portfolio totaled $924 million as of December 31, 2014, with 11.0% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of $87 million.   

CMBS    totaled $615 million as of December 31, 2014, with 59.7% rated investment grade and an unrealized net capital gain of
$42 million. The CMBS portfolio is subject to credit risk and has a sequential paydown structure. Of the CMBS investments, 96.4% are traditional conduit transactions collateralized by
commercial mortgage loans,
broadly diversified across property types and geographical area. The remainder consists of non-traditional CMBS such as small balance transactions, large loan pools and single borrower transactions.   

            Equity securities    primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate
investment trust equity investments. The equity securities portfolio was $4.10 billion as of December 31, 2014, with an unrealized net capital gain of $412 million.   

            Mortgage loans   , which are primarily held in the Allstate Financial portfolio, totaled $4.19 billion as of December 31, 2014
and primarily comprise loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. Key considerations used to manage our exposure include property type and geographic diversification. For
further detail on our mortgage loan portfolio, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.   

            Limited partnership interests    consist of investments in private equity/debt, real estate and other funds. The limited partnership
interests portfolio is diversified across a number of characteristics including fund managers, vintage years, strategies, geography (including international), and company/property types. Tax credit
funds were reclassified from limited partnership interests to other assets during 2014 since their return is in the form of tax credits rather than investment income. These tax credit funds totaled
$560 million as of December 31, 2014. The following table presents information about our limited partnership interests as of December 31, 2014.   

(1)     Includes
$562 million of infrastructure and real asset funds.    

88  

Table of Contents    

         The following tables show the earnings from our limited partnership interests by fund type and accounting classification for the years ended December 31.   

Limited
partnership interests produced income, excluding impairment write-downs, of $614 million in 2014 compared to $541 million in 2013. Higher EMA limited partnership
income resulted from favorable equity and real estate valuations which increased the carrying value of the partnerships. Income on EMA limited partnerships is recognized on a delay due to the
availability of the related financial statements. The recognition of income on private equity/debt funds and real estate funds are generally on a three month delay and the income recognition on other
funds is primarily on a one month delay. Income on cost method limited partnerships is recognized only upon receipt of amounts distributed by the partnerships.   

            Short-term investments    totaled $2.54 billion as of December 31, 2014.   

            Other investments    primarily comprise $1.66 billion of bank loans, $909 million of policy loans, $368 million of agent
loans (loans issued to exclusive Allstate agents) and $92 million of derivatives as of December 31, 2014. For further detail on our use of derivatives, see Note 7 of the
consolidated financial statements.   

            Unrealized net capital gains    totaled $3.17 billion as of December 31, 2014 compared to $2.70 billion as of
December 31, 2013. The increase for fixed income securities was primarily due to a decrease in risk-free interest rates, partially offset by the realization of unrealized net capital gains
through sales. The decrease for equity
securities was primarily due to the realization of unrealized net capital gains through sales, partially offset by positive equity market performance. The following table presents unrealized net
capital gains and losses as of December 31.   

The
unrealized net capital gain for the fixed income portfolio totaled $2.77 billion and comprised $3.08 billion of gross unrealized gains and $314 million of gross
unrealized losses as of December 31, 2014. This is compared to an unrealized net capital gain for the fixed income portfolio totaling $1.90 billion, comprised of $2.48 billion of
gross unrealized gains and $573 million of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2013.

Gross
unrealized gains and losses on fixed income securities by type and sector as of December 31, 2014 are provided in the following table.   

The
energy, banking, consumer goods and basic industry sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our corporate fixed income securities portfolio as of
December 31, 2014. In general, the gross unrealized losses are related to increasing risk-free interest rates or widening credit spreads since the time of initial purchase.   

         The
unrealized net capital gain for the equity portfolio totaled $412 million and comprised $467 million of gross unrealized gains and $55 million of gross
unrealized losses as of December 31, 2014. This is compared to an unrealized net capital gain for the equity portfolio totaling $624 million, comprised of $658 million of gross
unrealized gains and $34 million of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2013.   

         Gross
unrealized gains and losses on equity securities by sector as of December 31, 2014 are provided in the table below.

Table of Contents   

         Within
the equity portfolio, the losses were primarily concentrated in the energy, financial services and consumer goods sectors. The unrealized losses were company and sector specific.
As of December 31, 2014, we have the intent and ability to hold our equity securities with unrealized losses until recovery.   

         Global
oil prices have declined significantly in recent months. Within the energy sector outlined above, we continue to monitor the impact to our investment portfolio for those companies
that may be adversely affected, both directly and indirectly. If oil prices continue to decline or remain at depressed levels for an extended period, certain issuers and investments may come under
pressure.   

          Net investment income       The following table presents net investment income for the years ended December 31.   

Net
investment income decreased 12.3% or $484 million in 2014 compared to 2013, after decreasing 1.7% or $67 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The 2014 decrease was
primarily due to lower average investment balances relating to the sale of LBL on April 1, 2014, lower fixed income yields and equity dividends, partially offset by higher limited partnership
income. Net investment income in 2014 includes $114 million related to prepayment fee income and litigation proceeds compared to $139 million in 2013. These items may vary significantly
from period to period and may not recur. Higher EMA limited partnership income resulted from favorable equity and real estate valuations which increased the carrying value of the partnerships. The
2013 decrease was primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower fixed income yields, partially offset by higher limited partnership income and equity dividends, as well as prepayment
fee income and litigation proceeds which together increased 2013 income by a total of $68 million.   

Realized capital gains and losses       The following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect

Impairment write-downs   , which include changes in the mortgage loan valuation allowance, for the years ended December 31 are
presented in the following table.   

Impairment
write-downs on fixed income securities in 2014 were primarily driven by collateralized loan obligations that experienced deterioration in expected cash flows and municipal and
corporate fixed income securities impacted by issuer specific circumstances. Limited partnership write-downs primarily related to cost method limited partnerships that experienced declines in
portfolio valuations deemed to be other than temporary. Equity securities were written down primarily due to the length of time and extent to which fair value was below cost, considering our
assessment of the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends. The valuation allowance on mortgage loans as of
December 31, 2014 decreased compared to December 31, 2013 primarily due to reversals related to impaired loan payoffs.   

         Impairment
write-downs on fixed income securities in 2013 were primarily driven by CMBS that experienced deterioration in expected cash flows and municipal bonds impacted by issuer
specific circumstances. Limited partnership write-downs primarily related to cost method limited partnerships that experienced declines in portfolio valuations deemed to be other than temporary.
Equity securities were written down primarily due to the length of time and extent to which fair value was below cost, considering our assessment of the financial condition and near-term and long-term
prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends. The valuation allowance on mortgage loans as of December 31, 2013 decreased compared to December 31, 2012
primarily due to reversals related to loans no longer deemed impaired.   

         Impairment
write-downs on fixed income securities in 2012 were primarily driven by RMBS and CMBS that experienced deterioration in expected cash flows and municipal and corporate fixed
income securities impacted by issuer specific circumstances. Equity securities were written down primarily due to the length of time and extent to which fair value was below cost, considering our
assessment of the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends.   

Change in intent write-downs    were $213 million, $143 million and $48 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The change in intent write-downs in 2014 and 2013 were primarily related to the repositioning and ongoing portfolio management of our equity securities. For certain equity securities managed by third
parties, we do not retain decision making authority as it pertains to selling securities that are in an unrealized loss position and therefore we recognize any unrealized loss at the end of the period
through a charge to earnings. The change in intent write-downs in 2012 were primarily a result of ongoing comprehensive reviews of our portfolios resulting in write-downs of individually identified
investments, primarily RMBS and equity securities.   

            Sales    generated $975 million, $819 million and $536 million of net realized capital gains in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The sales in 2014 primarily related to equity and fixed income securities in connection with ongoing portfolio management. The sales in 2013 primarily related to equity securities in
connection with portfolio repositioning and ongoing portfolio management and municipal and corporate fixed income securities in conjunction with reducing our exposure to interest rate risk in the
Property-Liability portfolio. The sales in 2012 primarily related to corporate, municipal and U.S. government and agencies fixed income securities and equity securities in connection with portfolio
repositioning.   

            Valuation and settlements of derivative instruments    generated net realized capital losses of $36 million in 2014, net realized
capital losses of $10 million in 2013 and net realized capital gains of $24 million in 2012. The net realized capital losses in 2014 primarily comprised losses on equity futures used for
risk management due to increases in equity indices and losses on foreign currency contracts due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar. The net realized capital losses in 2013 primarily comprised
losses on equity futures used for risk management due to increases in equity indices and losses on credit default swaps due to the tightening of credit spreads on the underlying credit names. The net
realized capital gains in 2012 primarily included gains on credit default swaps due to the tightening of credit spreads on the underlying credit names.

MARKET RISK     

         Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency
exchange rates. Adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal policy, the economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, insolvency or financial distress
of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and/or risk tolerance. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and
equity prices.   

         The
active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges:
1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the type of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market risk
characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a
more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.   

           Overview       In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer
competitive rates
and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long-term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks
and product profiles of each business.   

         Investment
policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and controls over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that
conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are
appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. Executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through subsidiaries'
boards of directors and investment committees. For Allstate Financial, its asset-liability management ("ALM") policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks.
ALM focuses on strategies to enhance yields, mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for Allstate Financial while factoring in future expected cash requirements
to repay liabilities. Allstate Financial ALM activities follow asset-liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors. These ALM policies specify limits, ranges
and/or targets for investments that best meet Allstate Financial's business objectives in light of its product liabilities.   

         We
use quantitative and qualitative market-based approaches to measure, monitor and manage market risk. We evaluate our exposure to market risk through the use of multiple measures
including but not limited to duration, value-at-risk, scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis. Duration measures the price sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For
example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset with a duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by 5%. Value-at-risk is a statistical estimate of the probability
that the change in fair value of a portfolio will exceed a certain amount over a given time horizon. Scenario analysis estimates the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur
under different hypothetical market conditions defined by changes to multiple market risk factors: interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates. Sensitivity analysis
estimates the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur under different hypothetical shocks to a market risk factor. In general, we establish investment portfolio asset
allocation and market risk limits for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial businesses based upon a combination of duration, value-at-risk, scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis. The
asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. Comprehensive day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as
portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. For Allstate Financial, this day-to-day management is
integrated with and informed by the activities of the ALM organization. This integration is intended to result in a prudent, methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return,
conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of Allstate Financial's product liabilities and supported by the continuous application of advanced risk technology and analytics.   

         Although
we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the
Property-Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters.   

            Interest rate risk    is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the characteristics of our
interest bearing assets and liabilities. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as
we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and issue interest-sensitive liabilities. Interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in U.S. Treasury yields and other key risk-free
reference yields.   

         We
manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities and our assessment of overall economic and capital risk. One of the measures used to
quantify this exposure is duration. The difference in the   

  93  

Table of Contents   

  duration
of our assets relative to our liabilities is our duration gap. To calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net
present value using a risk-free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality, sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at
alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value. The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our
derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments, and certain other items including unearned premiums, property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, annuity
liabilities and other interest-sensitive liabilities. The projections include assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest
rates on the prepayment, lapse, leverage and/or option features of instruments, where applicable. The preceding assumptions relate primarily to callable municipal and corporate bonds, fixed rate
single and flexible premium deferred annuities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal housing bonds. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property-liability
policies.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, the difference between our asset and liability duration was a (1.26) gap compared to a (0.95) gap as of December 31, 2013. A negative duration gap
indicates that the fair value of our liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our assets, while a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our
assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities. The Property-Liability segment generally maintains a positive duration gap between its assets and
liabilities due to the relatively short duration of auto and homeowners claims, which are its primary liabilities. The Allstate Financial segment may have a positive or negative duration gap, as the
duration of its assets and liabilities vary with its product mix and investing activity. As of December 31, 2014, Property-Liability had a positive duration gap while Allstate Financial had a
negative duration gap.   

         In
the management of investments supporting the Property-Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return
framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth.   

For
the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that
will earn stable returns across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. To achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to a philosophy of
managing the duration of assets and related liabilities within predetermined tolerance levels. This philosophy is executed using duration targets for fixed income investments and may also include
interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps, floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other
derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments.   

Based
upon the information and assumptions used in the duration calculation, and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2014, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate,
parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would increase the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by $991 million, compared to an increase of $826 million as of
December 31, 2013, reflecting year to year changes in duration. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of
future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event. The estimate excludes the traditional and interest-sensitive life insurance products that are not considered
financial instruments and the $9.91 billion of assets supporting them and the associated liabilities. The $9.91 billion of assets excluded from the calculation decreased from
$13.13 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to the LBL sale. Based on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, the
assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by $583 million, compared to a decrease of $753 million as of December 31, 2013.   

         To
the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations
assume that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not
fully capture the effect of non-parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and/or large changes in interest rates.   

Credit spread risk    is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads ("spreads"). Credit spread is the
additional yield on fixed income securities and loans above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury securities) that market participants require to compensate them for
assuming credit, liquidity and/or prepayment risks. The magnitude of the spread will depend on the likelihood that a particular issuer will default ("credit risk"). This risk arises from many of our
primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in spread-sensitive fixed income assets.   

  94  

Table of Contents   

         We
manage the spread risk in our assets. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is spread duration. Spread duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to changes in
spreads. For example, if spreads increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a spread duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by 5%.   

Spread
duration is calculated similarly to interest rate duration. As of December 31, 2014, the spread duration of Property-Liability assets was 3.24, compared to 3.28 as of
December 31, 2013, and the spread duration of Allstate Financial assets was 5.81, compared to 5.35 as of December 31, 2013. Based upon the information and assumptions we use in this
spread duration calculation, and spreads in effect as of December 31, 2014, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in spreads across all asset classes, industry sectors
and credit ratings ("spread shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets by $2.91 billion compared to $3.46 billion as of December 31, 2013. Reflected in the duration
calculation are the effects of our tactical actions that use credit default swaps to manage spread risk. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in spreads should not be construed
as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.   

            Equity price risk    is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets. As of
December 31, 2014, we held $3.99 billion in common stocks and exchange traded and mutual funds and $4.64 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily limited
partnership interests and non-redeemable preferred securities), compared to $5.04 billion and $5.02 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. 74.8% of the common stocks and
exchange traded and mutual funds and 55.8% of the other securities with equity risk related to Property-Liability as of December 31, 2014, compared to 86.1% and 58.8%, respectively, as of
December 31, 2013.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a cash market portfolio beta of 1.21, compared to a beta of 1.10 as of
December 31, 2013. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investment's market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the Standard   Poor's
500 Composite Price Index ("S P 500"). Based on the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S P 500 increases or decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity investments will increase
or decrease by 12.1%, respectively. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta as of December 31, 2014, we estimate that an immediate decrease in the S P 500 of
10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments by $1.05 billion, compared to $1.10 billion as of December 31, 2013, and an immediate increase in the
S P 500 of 10% would increase the net fair value by $1.05 billion compared to $1.10 billion as of December 31, 2013. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease or increase
in the S P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.   

         The
beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined by calculating the change in the fair value of the portfolio resulting from stressing the equity market
up and down 10%. The illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if the future composition of the portfolio (hence its beta) and correlation relationships differ from the
historical relationships.   

         As
of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had separate account assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling $4.40 billion and
$6.74 billion, respectively. The December 31, 2013 balance included amounts classified as held for sale. Equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and
guarantees for death and/or income benefits provided by our variable products. In 2006, we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with The
Prudential Insurance Company of America, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial Inc. and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk. Equity risk for our variable life business relates to
contract charges and policyholder benefits. Total variable life contract charges for 2014 and 2013 were $47 million and $67 million, respectively. Separate account liabilities related to
variable life contracts were $77 million and $900 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline in separate accounts was the result of the LBL sale.   

         As
of December 31, 2014 and 2013 we had $1.49 billion and $3.71 billion, respectively, in equity-indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest
crediting rates based on the performance of the S P 500. We hedge the majority of the risk associated with these liabilities using equity-indexed options and futures and eurodollar futures,
maintaining risk within specified value-at-risk limits. $2.26 billion of the December 31, 2013 balance was a component of the LBL sale during 2014.   

            Foreign currency exchange rate risk    is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including common stocks, real estate funds and private equity funds, and our Canadian, Northern Ireland and Indian operations. We
also have investments in certain fixed income securities and emerging market fixed income funds that are denominated in foreign currencies; however, derivatives are used to hedge approximately 12% of
this foreign currency risk.   

  95  

Table of Contents   

         As
of December 31, 2014, we had $1.35 billion in foreign currency denominated equity investments, $843 million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries, primarily
related to our Canadian operations, and $283 million in unhedged non-dollar pay fixed income securities. These amounts were $1.10 billion, $878 million, and $330 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2013. 68.0% of the foreign currency exposure is in the Property-Liability business.   

         Based
upon the information and assumptions used as of December 31, 2014, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to
which we are exposed would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by $235 million, compared with an estimated $254 million decrease as of December 31,
2013. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of
such an event.   

         The
modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely
that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse
market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee.   

PENSION PLANS     

         We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full-time, certain part-time employees and employee-agents. Benefits are based
primarily on a cash balance formula, however certain participants have a significant portion of their benefits attributable to a former final average pay formula. 91% of the projected benefit
obligation of our primary qualified employee plan is related to the former final average pay formula. See Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these
plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements. The pension and other postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time. Any revisions could result in significant changes
to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans.   

         We
report unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders' equity. It represents the after-tax differences between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation ("PBO") for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation for other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost. As of December 31, 2014, unrecognized pension and other postretirement
benefit cost totaled $1.36 billion comprising $1.49 billion related to pension benefits and $(122) million related to other postretirement benefits. The unrecognized pension and
other postretirement benefit cost increased by $725 million as of December 31, 2014 from $638 million as of December 31, 2013. The measurement of the unrecognized pension
and other postretirement benefit cost can vary based upon the
fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below. The increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost
primarily related to actuarial assumption and census data updates, including decreases in the discount rate assumptions, the adoption of new Society of Actuaries mortality assumptions and lump sum
payments at discount rates lower than actuarial assumptions.   

         During
2014, we offered certain vested terminated employees the opportunity to receive lump sum payments. As a result, $75 million of benefit payments resulted in a reduction of
the pension benefit obligation of approximately $90 million.   

The
components of net periodic pension cost for all pension plans for the years ended December 31 are as follows:   

The
service cost component is the actuarial present value of the benefits attributed by the plans benefit formula to services rendered by the employees during the period. Interest cost
is the increase in the PBO in the period due to the passage of time at the discount rate. Interest cost fluctuates as the discount rate changes and is also impacted by the related change in the size
of the PBO. The decrease or increase in the PBO due to an increase or decrease in the discount rate is deferred and decreases or increases the net actuarial loss. It is recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income as unrecognized pension benefit cost and may be amortized.   

  96  

Table of Contents    

         The expected return on plan assets is determined as the product of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the adjusted fair value of plan
assets, referred to as the market-related value of plan assets. To determine the market-related value, the fair value of plan assets is adjusted annually so that differences between changes in the
fair value of equity securities and hedge fund limited partnerships and the expected long-term rate of return on these securities are recognized into the market-related value of plan assets over a
five year period. We believe this is consistent with the long-term nature of pension obligations.   

         When
the actual return on plan assets exceeds the expected return on plan assets it reduces the net actuarial loss; when the expected return exceeds the actual return it increases the
net actuarial loss. It is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrecognized pension benefit cost and may be amortized. The market-related value adjustment represents the current
difference between actual returns and expected returns on equity securities and hedge fund limited partnerships recognized over a five year period. The market-related value adjustment is a deferred
net loss of $104 million as of December 31, 2014. The expected return on plan assets fluctuates when the market-related value of plan assets changes and when the expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets assumption changes.   

         Amortization
of net actuarial loss in pension cost is recorded when the net actuarial loss including the unamortized market-related value adjustment exceeds 10% of the greater of the PBO
or the market-related value of plan assets. The amount of amortization is equal to the excess divided by the average remaining service period for active employees for each plan, which approximates
9 years for Allstate's largest plan. As a result, the effect of changes in the PBO due to changes in the discount rate and changes in the fair value of plan assets may be experienced in our net
periodic pension cost in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur.   

         Net
actuarial loss fluctuates as the discount rate fluctuates, as the actual return on plan assets differ from the expected long-term rate of return on plans assets, and as actual plan
experience differs from other actuarial assumptions. Net actuarial loss related to changes in the discount rate will change when interest rates change and from amortization of net actuarial loss when
there is an excess sufficient to qualify for amortization. Net actuarial loss related to changes in the fair value of plan assets will change when plan assets change in fair value and when there is an
excess sufficient to qualify for amortization. Other net actuarial loss will change over time due to changes in other valuation assumptions and the plan participants or when there is an excess
sufficient to qualify for amortization.   

         A
decrease in the discount rate increased the net actuarial loss by $576 million in 2014, an increase in the discount rate decreased the net actuarial loss by $593 million
in 2013, and a decrease in the discount rate increased the net actuarial loss by $806 million in 2012. The difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets decreased the net
actuarial loss by $144 million, $172 million, and $201 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.   

Settlement
charges are non-cash charges that accelerate the recognition of unrecognized pension benefit cost, that would have been incurred in subsequent periods, when plan payments
primarily lump sums from qualified pension plans, exceed a threshold of service and interest cost for the period. The value of lump sums paid in 2014 were lower as fewer employees retired than in
2013. The value of lump sums paid to employees electing retirement in 2013 was elevated due to historically low interest rates. Voluntary retirement activity during the fourth quarter of 2013 was
almost five times the typical level.   

         Net
periodic pension cost in 2015 is estimated to be $112 million including expected settlement charges of $25 million primarily for agent lump sum payments. Expected
returns on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits offset the other components of pension cost. The increase is due to higher amortization of net actuarial loss offset by a higher
expected return on assets. Pension expense is reported consistent with other types of employee compensation and as a result is included in claims expense, operating costs and expenses and investment
expense. Net periodic pension cost decreased in 2014 to $83 million compared to $495 million in 2013 due to a decrease in service cost from the new benefit formula, a decrease in the
amortization expense for the prior year's net actuarial losses which decreased due to a higher discount rate used to value the pension plan and lower settlements from fewer lump sum payments. Net
periodic pension cost increased in 2013 compared to $266 million in 2012 due to an increase in the amortization expense for prior year's net actuarial losses (gain) which increased due to a
lower discount rate used to value the pension plans. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, net pension cost included non-cash settlement charges resulting from lump sum distributions. Settlement charges are likely
to continue for some period in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents. The settlement charge threshold for our primary employee plan
is lower beginning in 2014 due to the new benefit formula and low interest rates and as a result a lower amount of lump sum benefits may trigger settlement charges in the future. If interest rates
increase in 2015, there may be an increase in employees electing retirement, which could trigger settlement charges in 2015.

Table of Contents   

         We
anticipate that the net actuarial loss for our pension plans will exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO or the market-related value of assets in 2015 and into the foreseeable future,
resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost. The net actuarial loss will be amortized over the remaining service life of active employees (approximately 9 years) or will
reverse with increases in the discount rate or better than expected returns on plan assets.   

Amounts
recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the discount rate and
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a
present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from non-callable bonds and bonds
with a make-whole provision available in the Bloomberg corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by S P or at least "Aa" by Moody's on the measurement date with cash flows that match
expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the credit spreads, yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of
selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income.   

         Holding
other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate would result in an increase of $31 million, pre-tax, in net periodic pension
cost and a $444 million, after-tax, increase in the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2014, compared to an
increase of $39 million, pre-tax, in net periodic pension cost and a $379 million, after-tax, increase in the unrecognized pension cost liability as of December 31, 2013. A
hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $29 million, pre-tax, and would decrease the unrecognized pension cost liability
recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income by $377 million, after-tax, as of December 31, 2014, compared to a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $35 million,
pre-tax, and a $322 million, after-tax, decrease in the unrecognized pension cost liability recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2013. This
non-symmetrical range results from the non-linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses.   

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long-term assumptions and is consistent with
long-term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets that may result in
variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are a component of net actuarial loss and are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income.   

         Holding
other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of $57 million
in pension cost as of December 31, 2014, compared to $55 million as of December 31, 2013. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $57 million as of December 31, 2014, compared to $55 million as of December 31, 2013.   

         The
primary qualified plans have unrealized gains as of December 31, 2014 of $510 million, an increase of $80 million from the prior year. 81% of unrealized gains
are related to equity securities as of December 31, 2014 compared to 100% as of December 31, 2013. During 2014, the two primary qualified plans realized capital gains of
$315 million. Given the Plan's exposure to an increase in interest rates, the plans shortened the duration of the plan assets in the fixed income portfolio.   

We
target funding levels in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") and generally accepted actuarial principles. Our funding levels were within our targeted
range as of December 31, 2014. In 2014, we contributed $49 million to our pension plans. We expect to contribute $127 million for the 2015 fiscal year to maintain the plans'
funded status. This estimate could change significantly following either an improvement or decline in investment markets.   

         Participating
subsidiaries fund the Plans' contributions under our master services cost sharing agreement. In addition, as a result of joint and several pension liability rules under the
Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, many liabilities that arise in connection with pension plans are joint and several across all members of a
controlled group of entities.

GOODWILL     

         Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
balances were $823 million and $396 million as of December 31, 2014 for the Allstate Protection segment and the Allstate Financial segment, respectively. Our reporting units are
equivalent to our reporting segments, Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business
combination.   

         Goodwill
is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of
the close of the third quarter. We also review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as deteriorating or adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more likely
than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its implied fair value.   

         Impairment
testing requires the use of estimates and judgments. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value,
the second step of the goodwill test is required. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a
business acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income.   

To
estimate the fair value of our reporting units for our annual impairment test, we initially utilize a stock price and market capitalization analysis and apportion the value between
our reporting units using peer company price to book multiples. If the stock price and market capitalization analysis does not result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding its carrying
value, we may also utilize a peer company price to earnings multiples analysis and/or a discounted cash flow analysis to supplement the stock price and market capitalization analysis. If a combination
of valuation techniques are utilized, the analyses would be weighted based on management's judgment of their relevance given current facts and circumstances.   

The
stock price and market capitalization analysis takes into consideration the quoted market price of our outstanding common stock and includes a control premium, derived from
historical insurance industry acquisition activity, in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units. The total market
capitalization of the consolidated entity is allocated to the individual reporting units using book value multiples derived from peer company data for the respective reporting units. The peer company
price to earnings multiples analysis takes into consideration the price earnings multiples of peer companies for each reporting unit and estimated income from our strategic plan. The discounted cash
flow analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenue growth, capital growth, earnings projections including those used in our strategic plan, and an appropriate discount rate. We apply significant
judgment when determining the fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation analyses
described above are subject to critical judgments and assumptions and may be potentially sensitive to variability. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent management's
reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions utilized may differ from future actual results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our
reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which may be material to our results of operations but not our financial position.   

During
fourth quarter 2014, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test using information as of September 30, 2014. The stock price and market capitalization analysis
resulted in the fair value of our reporting units exceeding their respective carrying values. The results of this analysis are supported by the operating performance of the individual reporting units
as well as their respective industry sector's performance. Goodwill impairment evaluations indicated no impairment as of December 31, 2014 and no reporting unit was at risk of having its
carrying value including goodwill exceed its fair value.   

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2014 HIGHLIGHTS     

Shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2014 was $22.30 billion, an increase of 3.8% from $21.48 billion as of
December 31, 2013.           On January 2, 2014, April 1, 2014, July 1, 2014 and October 1, 2014, we paid common shareholder dividends
of $0.25, $0.28, $0.28 and $0.28, respectively. On November 18, 2014, we declared a common shareholder dividend of $0.28 to be payable on January 2, 2015. On February 4, 2015, we
declared a common shareholder dividend of $0.30 to be payable on April 1, 2015.           During 2014, we repurchased 39.0 million common shares for $2.31 billion. As of
December 31, 2014, there was
$336 million remaining on our $2.5 billion common share repurchase program. On February 4, 2015, a new $3 billion common share repurchase program was authorized and is
expected to be completed by July 2016.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY     

            Capital resources    consist of shareholders' equity and debt, representing funds deployed
or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. The following table summarizes our capital resources as of December 31.   

Shareholders' equity    increased in 2014, primarily due to net income, the issuance of preferred stock and increased unrealized net capital
gains on investments, partially offset by common share repurchases, an increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost and dividends paid to shareholders. In 2014, we paid
dividends of $477 million and $87 million related to our common and preferred shares, respectively. Shareholders' equity increased in 2013, primarily due to net income, decreased
unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost, and the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by common share repurchases, decreased unrealized net capital gains on investments and
dividends paid to shareholders.   

           Preferred stock       In March 2014, we issued 29,900 shares of 6.625% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of
$747.5 million.
In June 2014, we issued 10,000 shares of 6.25% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $250 million. The proceeds of both issuances were used for general corporate
purposes.   

          Debt       $300 million of 6.20% Senior Notes were paid at maturity in May 2014 and $650 million of 5.00% Senior Notes were paid at
maturity
in August 2014. These Notes were paid from available funds. We have no debt maturities until 2018. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. For
further information on outstanding debt, see Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.   

            Capital resources    comprise an increased mix of preferred stock and subordinated debt due to issuances in 2013 and 2014 and the completion
of a tender offer to repurchase debt in 2013. As of December 31, 2014, capital resources includes $1.75 billion or 6.3% of preferred stock and $2.05 billion or 7.5% of
subordinated debt, a total of
13.8% compared to 10.2% as of December 31, 2013 and 3.8% as of December 31, 2012. This increases our strategic flexibility by decreasing our debt to shareholders' equity ratio, which is
one determinant of borrowing capacity.   

           Common share repurchases       As of December 31, 2014, our $2.5 billion common share repurchase program that commenced in February 2014
had
$336 million remaining and is expected to be completed in first quarter 2015. On February 4, 2015, a new $3 billion common share repurchase program was authorized and is expected
to be completed by July 2016.   

         During
2014, we repurchased 39.0 million common shares for $2.31 billion. In addition to open market transactions, we entered into two accelerated share repurchase
agreements each for the purchase of $750 million of our outstanding common stock. The first settled on July 29, 2014 and the second settled on December 18, 2014.   

         Since
1995, we have acquired 601 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $25.38 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued
121 million common shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation and the 2001 redemption of
certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Since 1995, total common shares outstanding has decreased by 480 million shares or 53.4%, primarily due to our repurchase programs.

Our
ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial
leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. Rating agencies continue to give favorable treatment in capitalization to preferred
stock and subordinated debt, of which Allstate had $3.80 billion as of December 31, 2014 compared to $2.83 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $1.00 billion as of
December 31, 2012.   

         In
February 2015, A.M. Best affirmed The Allstate Corporation's debt and commercial paper ratings of a- and AMB-1, respectively, and our insurance financial strength ratings of A+
for AIC and ALIC. The outlook for the ratings remained stable. In June 2014, S P affirmed The Allstate Corporation's debt and commercial paper ratings of A- and A-2, respectively, and our insurance
financial strength ratings of AA- for AIC and A+ for ALIC. The outlook for the ratings remained stable. In December 2014, Moody's affirmed ALIC's insurance financial strength rating of A1. The outlook
for the rating remained stable. There have been no changes to our debt, commercial paper and insurance financial strength rating for AIC from Moody's since December 31, 2013.   

We
have distinct and separately capitalized groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in New Jersey and Florida that maintain separate group ratings. The
ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate specifically to each group. Many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a secure
financial strength rating from an accredited rating agency. In February 2014, A.M. Best affirmed the Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company, which writes auto and homeowners insurance, rating of
A-. The outlook for this rating is stable. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company also has a Financial Stability Rating  of A" from Demotech, which was affirmed in November 2014. In August
2014, A.M. Best affirmed the Castle Key Insurance Company, which underwrites personal lines property insurance in Florida, rating of B-. The outlook for the rating is negative. Castle Key
Insurance Company also has a Financial Stability Rating  of A' from Demotech, which was affirmed in November 2014.   

         Beginning
in 2015, Allstate Financial will use a separately capitalized subsidiary, Allstate Assurance Company, to write life insurance business sold by Allstate exclusive agencies and
exclusive financial specialists that is currently written by LBL. As Allstate Assurance Company launches its products throughout the nation, LBL will cease writing that type of new business for
Allstate Financial. LBL life business sold through the Allstate agency channel
and all LBL payout annuity business will continue to be reinsured and serviced by ALIC. Allstate Assurance Company has a financial strength rating of A from A.M. Best and A1 by Moody's.   

         ALIC,
AIC and The Allstate Corporation are party to an Amended and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement ("Liquidity Agreement") which allows for short-term advances of funds to be
made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Liquidity Agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party. ALIC and AIC each serve as a
lender and borrower and the Corporation serves only as a lender. AIC also has a capital support agreement with ALIC. Under the capital support agreement, AIC is committed to provide capital to ALIC to
maintain an adequate capital level. The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is $1.00 billion.   

         In
addition to the Liquidity Agreement, the Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries, which include, but are not limited to, AIC and ALIC. The
amount of intercompany loans available to the Corporation's subsidiaries is at the discretion of the Corporation. The maximum amount of loans the Corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible
subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to $1.00 billion. The Corporation may use commercial paper borrowings, bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany
borrowings.   

         Allstate's
domestic property-liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted
by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium
growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining   

  101  

Table of Contents   

  their
ratings. As of December 31, 2014, total statutory surplus is $17.32 billion compared to $18.28 billion as of December 31, 2013. Property-Liability surplus was
$14.41 billion as of December 31, 2014, compared to $15.26 billion as of December 31, 2013. Allstate Financial surplus was $2.91 billion as of December 31,
2014, compared to $3.02 billion as of December 31, 2013. Additionally, Allstate Financial has short-term investments and cash of $98 million at Allstate Financial Insurance
Holdings Corporation intended to capitalize Allstate Assurance Company in early 2015.   

         The
ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property-casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a
company's premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies, and for homeowners and related coverages
that have significant net exposure to natural catastrophes a ratio of 1 to 1 is considered appropriate by the Company. AIC's combined premium to surplus ratio was 1.7x as of December 31, 2014
compared to 1.5x as of December 31, 2013.   

         The
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist
state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by state insurance regulators. The NAIC
analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed
ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Additional regulatory scrutiny may occur if a company's ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. Our domestic insurance companies
have no significant departure from these ranges.

         We
actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic, and business conditions. Liquidity is managed at both the entity and enterprise
level across the Company, and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs. Additionally, we have existing intercompany
agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the Company to enhance flexibility.   

           Parent company capital capacity       At the parent holding company level, we have deployable assets totaling $3.42 billion as of
December 31, 2014 comprising cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter. The substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of
capital generation for the Corporation. In 2015, AIC will have the capacity to pay dividends currently estimated at $2.31 billion without prior regulatory approval. This provides funds for the
parent company's fixed charges and other corporate purposes. In addition, we have access to $1.00 billion of funds from either commercial paper issuance or an unsecured revolving credit
facility.   

         In
2014, AIC paid dividends totaling $2.47 billion to its parent, Allstate Insurance Holdings, LLC ("AIH"), who then paid $2.46 billion of dividends to the
Corporation. In December 2014, AIC repurchased 2,967 common shares held by its parent, AIH, for an aggregate cash price of $1.20 billion, pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Agreement between AIC
and AIH entered into as of December 9, 2014. A subsequent dividend totaling $1.20 billion was paid by AIH to the Corporation in December 2014. In 2013, AIC paid dividends totaling
$1.95 billion to its parent, AIH who then paid the same amount of dividends to the Corporation. In 2012, AIC paid dividends totaling $1.51 billion. These dividends comprised
$1.06 billion in cash paid to AIH, of which $1.04 billion were paid by AIH to the Corporation, and the transfer of ownership (valued at $450 million) to AIH of three insurance
companies that were formerly subsidiaries of AIC (Allstate Indemnity Company, Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company and Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company). In 2014, 2013 and
2012, Allstate Financial paid $742 million, $774 million and $357 million, respectively, of returns of capital, repayments of surplus notes and dividends to AIC or the
Corporation. There were no capital contributions paid by the Corporation to AIC in 2014, 2013 or 2012. There were no capital contributions by AIC to ALIC in 2014, 2013 or 2012.   

Dividends
may not be paid or declared on our common stock and shares of common stock may not be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on our
preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for. We are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy, net income or
shareholders' equity levels, except out of the net proceeds of common stock issued during the 90 days prior to the date of declaration. As of December 31, 2014, we satisfied all of the
tests with no current restrictions on the payment of preferred stock dividends.   

         The
terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing,
acquiring, or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions. In
2014, we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures.   

         The
Corporation has access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows:  

A commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short-term cash needs. As of December 31,
2014, there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was $1.00 billion; however, the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily.           Our
$1.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility is available for short-term liquidity requirements and backs our
commercial paper facility. In April 2014, we amended the maturity date of this facility to April 2019 and also amended our option to extend the expiration by one year at the first and second
anniversary of the amendment, upon approval of existing or replacement lenders. The facility is fully subscribed among 12 lenders with the largest commitment being $115 million. The commitments
of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender's commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility. This facility contains an increase provision that
would allow up to an additional $500 million of borrowing. This facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement.
This ratio was 11.6% as of December 31, 2014. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing
under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. There were no borrowings under the credit facility during 2014. The total amount outstanding at any point in
time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility.           A universal shelf
registration statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012. We can use
this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock (including 482 million shares of treasury stock as of December 31, 2014), preferred stock,
depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and securities of trust subsidiaries. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will
be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.

           Liquidity exposure       Contractholder funds were $22.53 billion as of December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes contractholder
funds by their contractual withdrawal provisions as of December 31, 2014.   

(1)     Includes
$2.53 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5% of the account balance.      (2)     $1.67 billion
of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30-45 day period at the end of their
initial and subsequent interest rate guarantee periods (which are typically 5, 7 or 10 years) during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment.      (3)     86%
of these contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate guarantee of 3% or higher.       (4)     Includes
$844 million of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to The Prudential Insurance Company of
America, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial Inc., in 2006.    

Retail
life and annuity products may be surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons. Reasons unique to individual customers include a current or unexpected need for cash or a
change in life insurance coverage needs. Other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge, the length of time the contract has
been in force, distribution channel, market interest rates, equity market conditions and potential tax implications. In addition, the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower
than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement. The surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and
interest-sensitive life insurance products, based on the beginning of year contractholder funds, was 9.9% and 10.2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Allstate Financial strives to promptly pay customers
who request cash surrenders; however, statutory regulations generally provide up to six months in most states to fulfill surrender requests.   

         Our
asset-liability management practices enable us to manage the differences between the cash flows generated by our investment portfolio and the expected cash flow requirements of our
life insurance and annuity product obligations.   

         Certain
remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade
in our senior long-term debt rating of A3, A- and a- (from Moody's, S P and A.M. Best, respectively) to non-investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB-/bb, a downgrade in AIC's financial
strength rating from Aa3, AA- and A+ (from Moody's, S P and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa2/BBB/A-, or a downgrade in ALIC's financial strength ratings from A1, A+ and A+ (from Moody's,
S P and A.M. Best, respectively) to below A3/A-/A-. The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities; therefore, a rating change in one entity could
potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.   

         The
following table summarizes consolidated cash flow activities by segment.   

(1)     Business
unit cash flows reflect the elimination of intersegment dividends, contributions and borrowings.    

Property-Liability       Lower cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher claim payments, the
proceeds
received in 2013 from the surrender of company owned life insurance and higher   

  104  

Table of Contents   

  income
tax payments, partially offset by increased premiums and lower contributions to benefit plans. Higher cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower
claim payments, increased premiums and the surrender of company owned life insurance, partially offset by higher expenses and tax payments.   

         Cash
provided by investing activities in 2014 compared to cash used in investing activities in 2013 was primarily the result of increased sales of securities and short-term investments,
partially offset by increased purchases of securities. Increased sales and purchases of securities resulted from more active portfolio management. Higher cash used in investing activities in 2013
compared to 2012 was primarily related to 2013 operating cash flows being invested.   

           Allstate Financial       Lower cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower net investment income and
higher
income tax payments, partially offset by higher premiums on accident and health and traditional life insurance products. Lower cash provided by operating cash flows in 2013 compared to 2012 was
primarily due to lower net investment income, partially offset by lower contract benefits paid and higher premiums.   

         Lower
cash was provided by investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 as proceeds from the sale of LBL and higher sales of investments were more than offset by lower collections and
higher purchases of investments. Lower collections resulted from funding a large institutional product maturity in 2013 from the portfolio. Higher cash provided by investing activities in 2013
compared to 2012 was due to higher investment collections and higher financing needs to fund institutional product maturities.   

Lower
cash used in financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a $1.75 billion institutional product maturity in 2013 and lower contractholder benefits and
withdrawals on fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance, partially offset by lower deposits. Higher cash used in financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a
$1.75 billion institutional product maturity. For quantification of the changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD A.   

           Corporate and Other       Fluctuations in the Corporate and Other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany
settlements.
Investing activities primarily relate to investments in the parent company portfolio. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short-term debt,
repayment of debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt and preferred stock, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and common share repurchases; therefore, financing cash flows are
affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities.   

Contractual obligations and commitments       Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 and the payments due by period are shown in
the
following table.   

(1)     Liabilities
for collateral are typically fully secured with cash or short-term investments. We manage our short-term liquidity position to
ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short-term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business, including utilizing potential sources of
liquidity as disclosed previously.       (2)     Contractholder
funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life, fixed
annuities, including immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products. The reserve for life-contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life insurance,
immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance. These amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and
policyholders. Certain of these contracts, such as immediate    

105  

Table of Contents   

annuities without life contingencies and institutional products, involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable. These amounts relate to
(i) policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and (ii) contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by
the contract. Other contracts, such as interest-sensitive life, fixed deferred annuities, traditional life insurance, immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health
insurance, involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. For these contracts, we are not currently making payments and will not make
payments until (i) the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or (ii) the occurrence of a payment triggering event such as the surrender or partial withdrawal on a
policy or deposit contract, which is outside of our control. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment
patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, estimated additional deposits for interest-sensitive life
contracts, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. Such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of
mortality, retirement, and other appropriate factors, but are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the
corresponding liabilities of $22.53 billion for contractholder funds and $12.38 billion for reserve for life-contingent contract benefits as included in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position as of December 31, 2014. The liability amount in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing
of other factors as described above.    

(3)     Amount
differs from the balance presented on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2014 because the
long-term debt amount above includes interest.       (4)     Our
payment obligations relating to capital lease obligations, operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations and pension and other
postretirement benefits ("OPEB") contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long-term liquidity management program.       (5)     The
pension plans' obligations in the next 12 months represent our planned contributions where the benefit obligation exceeds the
assets, and the remaining years' contributions are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans. The OPEB plans' obligations are estimated
based on the expected benefits to be paid. These liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the
corresponding liability amount of $722 million included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.       (6)     Reserve
for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims,
including claims that have been IBNR as of the balance sheet date. We have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns.
However, the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above, especially for IBNR claims. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are
our best estimates. The reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of December 31, 2014, of
$1.49 billion and $267 million, respectively.       (7)     Other
liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding. Certain
of these long-term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest, as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of
$4.17 billion.       (8)     Balance
sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of $12.45 billion and gross deferred
tax liabilities of $2.49 billion. These items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third
parties. Rather, they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis. In addition, other liabilities of $271 million were not included
in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain.    

Our
contractual commitments as of December 31, 2014 and the periods in which the commitments expire are shown in the following table.   

Contractual
commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements, limited partnership interests and other loans. Limited partnership interests are typically funded
over the commitment period which is shorter than the contractual expiration date of the partnership and as a result, the actual timing of the funding may vary.   

         We
have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material intercompany
transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance
as required.   

         For
a more detailed discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.   

ENTERPRISE RISK AND RETURN MANAGEMENT     

         In addition to the normal risks of business, Allstate is subject to significant risks as an insurer and a provider of other products
and financial services. These risks are discussed in more detail in the Risk Factors section of this document. Allstate manages enterprise risk under an integrated Enterprise Risk and Return
Management ("ERRM") framework   

  106  

Table of Contents   

  with
risk-return principles, governance, modeling and analytics, and importantly, transparent management dialogue. This framework provides a comprehensive view of risks and opportunities and is used
by senior leaders and business managers to provide risk and return insight and drive strategic and business decisions. Allstate's risk management strategies adapt to changes in business and market
environments and seek to optimize returns. Allstate continually validates and improves its ERRM practices by benchmarking and securing external perspectives for our processes.   

         Our
qualitative risk-return principles define how we operate and guide decision-making around risk and return. These principles state that, first and foremost, our priority is to protect
solvency, comply with laws and act with integrity. Building upon this foundation, we strive to build strategic value and optimize risks and returns.   

ERRM
governance includes an executive management committee structure, Board oversight and chief risk officers ("CROs"). The Enterprise Risk   Return Council ("ERRC") is Allstate's
senior risk management committee that directs ERRM by establishing risk-return targets, determining economic capital levels and directing integrated strategies and actions from an enterprise
perspective. The ERRC consists of Allstate's chief executive officer, president, business unit presidents, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general
counsel and treasurer. Allstate's Board of Directors, Risk and Return Committee and Audit Committee provide ERRM oversight by reviewing enterprise principles, guidelines and limits for Allstate's
significant risks and by monitoring strategies and actions management has taken to control these risks. Allstate's Board of Directors has overall responsibility for oversight of management's design
and implementation of ERRM. Risk and Return Committee oversight focuses on the risk and return position of the company and Audit Committee oversight focuses on risk assessment and risk management
policies, including the effectiveness of management's control environment.   

         CROs
are appointed for the enterprise and for Allstate Protection, Allstate Financial, Allstate Investments, and Allstate's technology organization. Collectively, the CROs create an
integrated approach to risk and return management to ensure risk management practices and strategies are aligned with Allstate's overall enterprise objectives. The shared ERRM framework establishes a
basis for transparency and dialogue across the organization and for continuous learning by embedding the risk and return management culture of identifying, measuring, managing, monitoring and
reporting risks.   

         Our
ERRM governance is supported with an analytic framework to manage significant insurance, investment, financial, strategic, and operational risk exposures and optimize returns on
risk-adjusted capital. Management and the ERRC use enterprise stochastic modeling, risk expertise and judgment to determine an appropriate level of targeted enterprise economic capital to hold
considering a broad range of risk objectives and external constraints. These include limiting risks of financial stress, insolvency, likelihood of capital stress and volatility, maintaining
stakeholder value and financial strength ratings and satisfying regulatory and rating agency risk-based capital requirements. We generally assess solvency on a statutory accounting basis, but also
consider GAAP volatility. Enterprise economic capital approximates a combination of statutory surplus and deployable invested assets at the parent holding company level.   

         Using
our governance and analytic framework, Allstate designs business and enterprise strategies that seek to optimize returns on risk-adjusted capital. Examples include reducing
exposure to rising interest rates and spread-based products through the divestiture of LBL; executing customer-focused growth strategies; improving profitability; increasing investments in which we
have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic operating or market performance, including limited partnerships, equities and real estate; and growing
homeowners insurance in areas previously restricted where we believe we can earn an appropriate return for the risk.   

REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     

         We are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on
specific aspects of our business. For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.   

PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS     

         There are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented because the implementation date has not yet occurred. For a
discussion of these pending standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.   

         The
effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the
standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the
relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            

   1.     General     

Basis of presentation     

         The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Allstate Corporation (the "Corporation") and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, primarily Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC"), a property-liability insurance company with various property-liability and life and investment subsidiaries, including Allstate Life
Insurance Company ("ALIC") (collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Allstate"). These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.   

         To
conform to the current year presentation, certain amounts in the prior year notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified.   

         The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   

Nature of operations     

         Allstate is engaged, principally in the United States, in the property-liability insurance and life insurance business. Allstate's
primary business is the sale of private passenger auto and homeowners insurance. The Company also sells several other personal property and casualty insurance products, select commercial property and
casualty coverages, life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance. Allstate primarily distributes its products through exclusive agencies, financial specialists, independent agencies,
contact centers and the internet.   

         The
Allstate Protection segment principally sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, with earned premiums accounting for 82% of Allstate's 2014 consolidated revenues.
Allstate was the country's second largest personal property and casualty insurer as of December 31, 2013. Allstate Protection, through several companies, is authorized to sell certain
property-liability products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The Company is also authorized to sell certain insurance products in Canada. For 2014, the top geographic
locations for premiums earned by the Allstate Protection segment were Texas, California, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of premiums earned for
Allstate Protection.   

         Allstate
has exposure to catastrophes, an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance business, which have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to material year-to-year
fluctuations in the Company's results of operations and financial position (see Note 8). The nature and level of catastrophic loss caused by natural events (high winds, winter storms,
tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes) and man-made events (terrorism and industrial accidents) experienced in any period cannot be predicted and
could be material to results of operations and financial position. The Company considers the
greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. The Company considers
the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes and fires following earthquakes to be major metropolitan areas near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, Washington,
South Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The Company also has exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims (see Note 14).   

         The
Allstate Financial segment sells traditional, interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance products. The Company previously offered and
continues to have in force fixed annuities such as deferred and immediate annuities, and institutional products consisting of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back
medium-term notes.   

         Allstate
Financial, through several companies, is authorized to sell life insurance and retirement products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Guam. Beginning in 2015, voluntary accident and health insurance products are planned to be sold in Canada. For 2014, the top geographic locations for statutory premiums and annuity
considerations for the Allstate Financial segment were California, Texas, Florida and New York. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for
Allstate Financial. Allstate Financial distributes its products through Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists, and workplace enrolling independent agents.   

Allstate
has exposure to market risk as a result of its investment portfolio. Market risk is the risk that the Company will incur realized and unrealized net capital losses due to
adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices   

  114  

Table of Contents   

  or
currency exchange rates. The Company's primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices. Interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will incur a
loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of its interest bearing assets and liabilities. This risk arises from many of the Company's primary
activities, as it invests substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and issues interest-sensitive liabilities. Interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in U.S. Treasury yields and
other key risk-free reference yields. Credit spread risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads. This risk arises from many of the Company's primary
activities, as the Company invests substantial funds in spread-sensitive fixed income assets. Equity price risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general
levels of the equity markets.   

         The
Company monitors economic and regulatory developments that have the potential to impact its business. Federal and state laws and regulations affect the taxation of insurance
companies and life insurance products. Congress and various state legislatures from time to time consider legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently
applicable to life insurance. Congress and various state legislatures also consider proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance.
Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of the Company's products
making them less competitive. Such proposals, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial position or Allstate Financial's ability to sell such products and could result in the
surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning.   

   2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     

Investments     

         Fixed income securities include bonds, asset-backed securities ("ABS"), residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), commercial
mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed income securities, which may be sold prior to their contractual maturity, are designated as available for sale and are
carried at fair value. The difference between amortized cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes and related life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), deferred sales
inducement costs ("DSI") and reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Cash received from calls and make-whole payments is
reflected as a component of proceeds from sales and cash received from maturities and pay-downs is reflected as a component of investment collections within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   

         Equity
securities primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments. Equity
securities are designated as available for sale and are carried at fair value. The difference between cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, is reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income.   

Mortgage
loans are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized premium or discount and valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are established for impaired loans when it
is probable that contractual principal and interest will not be collected.   

         Investments
in limited partnership interests, including interests in private equity/debt funds, real estate funds and other funds, where the Company's interest is so minor that it
exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for in accordance with the cost method of accounting; all other investments in limited partnership interests are
accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting ("EMA").   

         Short-term
investments, including money market funds, commercial paper and other short-term investments, are carried at fair value. Other investments primarily consist of bank loans,
policy loans, agent loans and derivatives. Bank loans are primarily senior secured corporate loans and are carried at amortized cost. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances and were
$909 million and $919 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Agent loans are loans issued to exclusive Allstate agents and are carried at unpaid principal
balances, net of valuation allowances and unamortized deferred fees or costs. Derivatives are carried at fair value.   

Investment
income primarily consists of interest, dividends, income from certain derivative transactions, and income from limited partnership interests. Interest is recognized on an
accrual basis using the effective yield method and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date. Interest income for ABS, RMBS and CMBS is
determined considering estimated pay-downs, including prepayments, obtained from third party data sources and internal estimates. Actual prepayment experience is periodically reviewed and effective
yields are recalculated when differences   

  115  

Table of Contents   

  arise
between the prepayments originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and currently anticipated. For ABS, RMBS and CMBS of high credit quality with fixed interest rates, the
effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis. For all others, the effective yield is recalculated on a prospective basis. Accrual of income is suspended for other-than-temporarily impaired
fixed income securities when the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be received is not reasonably estimable. Accrual of income is suspended for mortgage loans, bank loans and agent loans that
are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Cash receipts on investments on nonaccrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of
carrying value. Income from cost method limited partnership interests is recognized upon receipt of amounts distributed by the partnerships. Income from EMA limited partnership interests is recognized
based on the Company's share of the partnerships' net income, including unrealized gains and losses, and is recognized on a delay due to the availability of the related financial statements. Income
recognition on private equity/debt funds and real estate funds is generally on a three month delay and income recognition on other funds is generally on a one month delay.   

Realized
capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investment sales, write-downs in value due to other-than-temporary declines in fair value, adjustments to valuation
allowances on mortgage loans and agent loans, and periodic changes in fair value and settlements of certain derivatives including hedge ineffectiveness. Realized capital gains and losses on investment
sales are determined on a specific identification basis.   

Derivative and embedded derivative financial instruments     

         Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, futures (interest rate and equity), options
(including swaptions), interest rate caps, warrants and rights, foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards, certain investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements, and certain bond forward
purchase commitments. Derivatives required to be separated from the host instrument and accounted for as derivative financial instruments ("subject to bifurcation") are embedded in certain fixed
income securities, equity-indexed life and annuity contracts, reinsured variable annuity contracts and certain funding agreements.   

         All
derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis and reported as other investments, other assets, other liabilities and accrued expenses or contractholder funds. Embedded
derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are also accounted for on a fair value basis and are reported together with the host contract. The change in fair value of derivatives embedded in certain
fixed income securities and subject to bifurcation is reported in realized capital gains and losses. The change in fair value of derivatives embedded in life and annuity product contracts and subject
to bifurcation is reported in life and annuity contract benefits or interest credited to contractholder funds. Cash flows from embedded derivatives subject to bifurcation and derivatives receiving
hedge accounting are reported consistently with the host contracts and hedged risks, respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows. Cash flows from other derivatives are reported in cash flows from investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   

         When
derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow
hedges. The hedged item may be either all or a specific portion of a recognized asset, liability or an unrecognized firm commitment attributable to a particular risk for fair value hedges. At the
inception of the hedge, the Company formally documents the hedging relationship and risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the
nature of the risk being hedged and the methodology used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the
hedged risk. For a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The Company does not exclude any component of
the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, the Company confirms that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in
offsetting the hedged risk. Ineffectiveness in fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, if any, is reported in realized capital gains and losses.   

           Fair value hedges       The change in fair value of hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of investment assets or a portion thereof is
reported in
net investment income, together with the change in fair value of the hedged items. The change in fair value of hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of contractholder funds liabilities or a
portion thereof is reported in interest credited to contractholder funds, together with the change in fair value of the hedged items. Accrued periodic settlements on swaps are reported together with
the changes in fair value of the swaps in net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds. The amortized cost for fixed income securities, the carrying value for mortgage loans or
the carrying value of the hedged liability is adjusted for the change in fair value of the hedged risk.

Table of Contents   

Cash flow hedges       For hedging instruments used in cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives representing the effective
portion of
the hedge are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified to net investment income, realized capital gains and losses or interest expense as the hedged or forecasted
transaction affects income. Accrued periodic settlements on derivatives used in cash flow hedges are reported in net investment income. The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
for a hedged transaction is limited to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative less the amount reclassified to income, or the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative needed to
offset the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction from inception of the hedge less the derivative gain or loss previously reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to income. If the Company expects at any time that the loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to a net loss on the combination of the hedging
instrument and the hedged transaction which may not be recoverable, a loss is recognized immediately in realized capital gains and losses. If an impairment loss is recognized on an asset or an
additional obligation is incurred on a liability involved in a hedge transaction, any offsetting gain in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified and reported together with the
impairment loss or recognition of the obligation.   

          Termination of hedge accounting       If, subsequent to entering into a hedge transaction, the derivative becomes ineffective (including if the
hedged item
is sold or otherwise extinguished, the occurrence of a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable or the hedged asset becomes other-than-temporarily impaired), the Company may terminate the
derivative position. The Company may also terminate derivative instruments or redesignate them as non-hedge as a result of other events or circumstances. If the derivative instrument is not terminated
when a fair value hedge is no longer effective, the future gains and losses recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When a fair value hedge is no longer
effective, is redesignated as non-hedge or when the derivative has been terminated, the fair value gain or loss on the hedged asset, liability or portion thereof which has already been recognized in
income while the hedge was in place and used to adjust the amortized cost for fixed income securities, the carrying value for mortgage loans or the carrying value of the hedged liability, is amortized
over the remaining life of the hedged asset, liability or portion thereof, and reflected in net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds beginning in the period that hedge
accounting is no longer applied. If the hedged item in a fair value hedge is an asset that has become other-than-temporarily impaired, the adjustment made to the amortized cost for fixed income
securities or the carrying value for mortgage loans is subject to the accounting policies applied to other-than-temporarily impaired assets.   

When
a derivative instrument used in a cash flow hedge of an existing asset or liability is no longer effective or is terminated, the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to income as the hedged risk impacts income. If the derivative instrument is not terminated when a cash flow hedge is no longer effective, the
future gains and losses recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When a derivative instrument used in a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction is terminated
because it is probable the forecasted transaction will not occur, the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is immediately reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to realized
capital gains and losses in the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied.   

Non-hedge derivative financial instruments       For derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied, the income statement effects, including
fair
value gains and losses and accrued periodic settlements, are reported either in realized capital gains and losses or in a single line item together with the results of the associated asset or
liability for which risks are being managed.   

Securities loaned     

         The Company's business activities include securities lending transactions, which are used primarily to generate net investment income.
The proceeds received in conjunction with securities lending transactions are reinvested in short-term investments. These transactions are short-term in nature, usually 30 days or less.   

         The
Company receives cash collateral for securities loaned in an amount generally equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and records
the related obligations to return the collateral in other liabilities and accrued expenses. The carrying value of these obligations approximates fair value because of their relatively short-term
nature. The Company monitors the market value of securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral as necessary under the terms of the agreements to mitigate
counterparty credit risk. The Company maintains the right and ability to repossess the securities loaned on short notice.

Recognition of premium revenues and contract charges, and related benefits and interest
credited     

         Property-liability premiums are deferred and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies, typically periods of six or
twelve months. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums. Premium installment receivables, net, represent premiums written and
not yet collected, net of an allowance for uncollectible premiums. The Company regularly evaluates premium installment receivables and adjusts its valuation allowance as appropriate. The valuation
allowance for uncollectible premium installment receivables was $83 million and $77 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   

         Traditional
life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life insurance products. Voluntary accident
and health insurance products are expected to remain in force for an extended period. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Benefits are reflected in life
and annuity contract benefits and recognized in relation to premiums, so that profits are recognized over the life of the policy.   

         Immediate
annuities with life contingencies, including certain structured settlement annuities, provide insurance protection over a period that extends beyond the period during which
premiums are collected. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when received at the inception of the contract. Benefits and expenses are recognized in relation to premiums. Profits
from these policies come from investment income, which is recognized over the life of the contract.   

Interest-sensitive
life contracts, such as universal life and single premium life, are insurance contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed include
premiums paid by the contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder account balance and contract charges assessed against the contractholder account balance. Premiums from these contracts are
reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for the cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract administration and
surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates. These contract charges are recognized as revenue when assessed against the contractholder account balance. Life and annuity contract
benefits include life-contingent benefit payments in excess of the contractholder account balance.   

Contracts
that do not subject the Company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are referred to as investment contracts. Fixed annuities, including market value
adjusted annuities, equity-indexed annuities and immediate annuities without life contingencies, and funding agreements (primarily backing medium-term notes) are considered investment contracts.
Consideration received for such contracts is reported as contractholder fund
deposits. Contract charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for maintenance, administration and surrender of the contract prior to
contractually specified dates, and are recognized when assessed against the contractholder account balance.   

Interest
credited to contractholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest-sensitive life and investment contracts. Crediting rates for certain fixed annuities and
interest-sensitive life contracts are adjusted periodically by the Company to reflect current market conditions subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates. Crediting rates for indexed life and
annuities and indexed funding agreements are generally based on a specified interest rate index or an equity index, such as the Standard   Poor's ("S P") 500 Index. Interest credited also
includes amortization of DSI expenses. DSI is amortized into interest credited using the same method used to amortize DAC.   

Contract
charges for variable life and variable annuity products consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balances for contract maintenance, administration, mortality,
expense and surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates. Contract benefits incurred for variable annuity products include guaranteed minimum death, income, withdrawal and
accumulation benefits. Substantially all of the Company's variable annuity business is ceded through reinsurance agreements and the contract charges and contract benefits related thereto are reported
net of reinsurance ceded.   

Deferred policy acquisition and sales inducement costs     

         Costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal property-liability insurance, life insurance and
investment contracts are deferred and recorded as DAC. These costs are principally agents' and brokers' remuneration, premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses. DSI costs, which are deferred and
recorded as other assets, relate to sales inducements offered on sales to new customers, principally on fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life contracts. These sales inducements are primarily in
the form of additional credits to the customer's account balance or enhancements to interest credited for a specified period which are in excess of the rates currently being credited to similar
contracts without sales inducements. All other acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and included in   

  118

  operating
costs and expenses. DAC associated with property-liability insurance is amortized into income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of six or twelve months, and is included in
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. DAC associated with property-liability insurance is periodically reviewed for recoverability and adjusted if necessary. Future investment income is
considered in determining the recoverability of DAC. Amortization of DAC associated with life insurance and investment contracts is included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and is
described in more detail below. DSI is amortized into income using the same methodology and assumptions as DAC and is included in interest credited to contractholder funds.   

         For
traditional life insurance, DAC is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business. Assumptions used in the
amortization of DAC and reserve calculations are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in
force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events
occur. Generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of DAC for these policies on an
aggregate basis using actual experience. The Company aggregates all traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies in the analysis. If actual experience is
significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance would be expensed to the extent not recoverable and
the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required.   

         For
interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts, DAC and DSI are amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits, which
includes both actual historical gross profits ("AGP") and estimated future gross profits ("EGP") expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts. The amortization is net of interest on
the prior period DAC balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts. Actual amortization periods generally range from 15-30 years; however, incorporating estimates of the
rate of customer surrenders, partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the DAC being amortized during the surrender charge period, which is typically 10-20 years for
interest-sensitive life and 5-10 years for fixed annuities. The cumulative DAC and DSI amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income when there is a
difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total EGP. When DAC or DSI amortization or a component of gross profits for
a quarterly period is potentially negative (which would result in an increase of the DAC or DSI balance) as a result of negative AGP, the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the potential
negative amortization are considered to determine whether it is appropriate for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Negative amortization is only recorded when the increased DAC or
DSI balance is determined to be recoverable based on facts and circumstances. Recapitalization of DAC and DSI is limited to the originally deferred costs plus interest.   

         AGP
and EGP primarily consist of the following components: contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits; investment income and realized capital
gains and losses less interest credited; and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses. The principal assumptions for determining the amount of EGP are persistency, mortality,
expenses, investment returns, including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of any hedges. For products
whose supporting investments are exposed to capital losses in excess of the Company's expectations which may cause periodic AGP to become temporarily negative, EGP and AGP utilized in DAC and DSI
amortization may be modified to exclude the excess capital losses.   

         The
Company performs quarterly reviews of DAC and DSI recoverability for interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts in the aggregate using current
assumptions. If a change in the amount of EGP is significant, it could result in the unamortized DAC or DSI not being recoverable, resulting in a charge which is included as a component of
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or interest credited to contractholder funds, respectively.   

The
DAC and DSI balances presented include adjustments to reflect the amount by which the amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or decrease if the unrealized capital gains or losses
in the respective product investment portfolios were actually realized. The adjustments are recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income. DAC, DSI and deferred income taxes determined
on unrealized capital gains and losses and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income recognize the impact on shareholders' equity consistently with the amounts that would be recognized in the
income statement on realized capital gains and losses.   

Customers
of the Company may exchange one insurance policy or investment contract for another offered by the Company, or make modifications to an existing investment, life or
property-liability contract issued by the Company.   

  119  

Table of Contents   

  These
transactions are identified as internal replacements for accounting purposes. Internal replacement transactions determined to result in replacement contracts that are substantially unchanged
from the replaced contracts are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts. Unamortized DAC and DSI related to the replaced contracts continue to be deferred and amortized in connection
with the replacement contracts. For interest-sensitive life and investment contracts, the EGP of the replacement contracts are treated as a revision to the EGP of the replaced contracts in the
determination of amortization of DAC and DSI. For traditional life and property-liability insurance policies, any changes to unamortized DAC that result from replacement contracts are treated as
prospective revisions. Any costs associated with the issuance of replacement contracts are characterized as maintenance costs and expensed as incurred. Internal replacement transactions determined to
result in a substantial change to the replaced contracts are accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contracts, and any unamortized DAC and DSI related to the replaced contracts are
eliminated with a corresponding charge to amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or interest credited to contractholder funds, respectively.   

         The
costs assigned to the right to receive future cash flows from certain business purchased from other insurers are also classified as DAC in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position. The costs capitalized represent the present value of future profits expected to be earned over the lives of the contracts acquired. These costs are amortized as profits emerge over the lives
of the acquired business and are periodically evaluated for recoverability. The present value of future profits was $66 million and $79 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Amortization expense of the present value of future profits was $13 million, $16 million and $41 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

Reinsurance     

         In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses on large risks by purchasing
reinsurance. The Company has also used reinsurance to effect the acquisition or disposition of certain blocks of business. The amounts reported as reinsurance recoverables include amounts billed to
reinsurers on losses paid as well as estimates of amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers on insurance liabilities and contractholder funds that have not yet been paid. Reinsurance
recoverables on unpaid losses are estimated based upon assumptions consistent with those used in establishing the liabilities related to the underlying reinsured contracts. Insurance liabilities are
reported gross of reinsurance recoverables. Reinsurance premiums are generally reflected in income in a manner consistent with the recognition of premiums on the reinsured contracts. For catastrophe
coverage, the cost of reinsurance premiums is recognized ratably over the contract period to the extent coverage remains available. Reinsurance does not extinguish the Company's primary liability
under the policies written. Therefore, the Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers, including their activities with respect to claim settlement practices and
commutations, and establishes allowances for uncollectible reinsurance as appropriate.   

Goodwill     

         Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
balances were $823 million and $396 million as of December 31, 2014 and $825 million and $418 million as of December 31, 2013 for the Allstate Protection
segment and the Allstate Financial segment, respectively. The Company's reporting units are equivalent to its reporting segments, Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial. Goodwill is allocated to
reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. The Company
performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the third quarter. The Company also reviews goodwill for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances, such as deteriorating or adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may exceed its implied fair value.   

         To
estimate the fair value of its reporting units, the Company may utilize a combination of widely accepted valuation techniques including a stock price and market capitalization
analysis, discounted cash flow calculations and peer company price to earnings multiples analysis. The stock price and market capitalization analysis takes into consideration the quoted market price
of the Company's outstanding common stock and includes a control premium, derived from historical insurance industry acquisition activity, in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated
entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units. The discounted cash flow analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenue growth, capital growth, earnings projections
including those used in the Company's strategic plan, and an appropriate discount rate. The peer company price to earnings multiples analysis takes into consideration the price to earnings multiples
of peer companies for each reporting unit and estimated income from the Company's strategic plan.   

         Goodwill
impairment evaluations indicated no impairment as of December 31, 2014 or 2013.

Table of Contents    

Property and equipment     

         Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Included in property and equipment are capitalized costs
related to computer software licenses and software developed for internal use. These costs generally consist of certain external payroll and payroll related costs. Certain facilities and equipment
held under capital leases are also classified as property and equipment with the related lease obligations recorded as liabilities. Property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 10 years for equipment and 40 years for real property. Depreciation expense is reported in operating
costs and expenses. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment was $2.12 billion and $2.19 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Depreciation expense on
property and equipment was $228 million, $208 million and $214 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment at least
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.   

Income taxes     

         The income tax provision is calculated under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. The principal assets and liabilities giving rise to such differences are DAC, unrealized
capital gains and losses, unearned premiums, differences in tax bases of invested assets and insurance reserves. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established when there is uncertainty that
such assets will be realized.   

Reserves for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense and life-contingent
contract benefits     

         The reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is the estimate of amounts necessary to settle all reported and
unreported claims for the ultimate cost of insured property-liability losses, based upon the facts of each case and the Company's experience with similar cases. Estimated amounts of salvage and
subrogation are deducted from the reserve for claims and claims expense. The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, is an inherently uncertain and complex
process. Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current information available. Any resulting reestimates are reflected in current results of operations.   

         The
reserve for life-contingent contract benefits payable under insurance policies, including traditional life insurance, life-contingent immediate annuities and voluntary accident and
health insurance products, is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. These assumptions, which for
traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage, year of issue and
policy duration. The assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not changed during the life of the policy. The Company periodically reviews the adequacy of reserves
for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience. If actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist,
any remaining unamortized DAC balance would be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required. To the extent that unrealized gains on
fixed income securities would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, the related increase in reserves for certain immediate annuities with life contingencies is recorded net of
tax as a reduction of unrealized net capital gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income.   

Contractholder funds     

         Contractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest-sensitive life
insurance, fixed annuities and funding agreements. Contractholder funds
primarily comprise cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract benefits, surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and contract charges for mortality or
administrative expenses. Contractholder funds also include reserves for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance and certain fixed annuity contracts and reserves for certain
guarantees on reinsured variable annuity contracts.   

Held for sale classification     

         Business is classified as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business, the sale is probable to
occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is
recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value   

  121  

Table of Contents   

  less
cost to sell, a loss is recognized. Assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the Consolidated Statement of Position in the period in which the
business is classified as held for sale.   

Separate accounts     

         Separate accounts assets are carried at fair value. The assets of the separate accounts are legally segregated and available only to
settle separate account contract obligations. Separate accounts liabilities represent the contractholders' claims to the related assets and are carried at an amount equal to the separate accounts
assets. Investment income and realized capital gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contractholders and therefore are not included in the Company's Consolidated Statements
of Operations. Deposits to and surrenders and withdrawals from the separate accounts are reflected in separate accounts liabilities and are not included in consolidated cash flows.   

Absent
any contract provision wherein the Company provides a guarantee, variable annuity and variable life insurance contractholders bear the investment risk that the separate accounts'
funds may not meet their stated investment objectives. Substantially all of the Company's variable annuity business was reinsured beginning in 2006.   

Deferred Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") expense     

         Deferred ESOP expense represents the remaining unrecognized cost of shares acquired by the Allstate ESOP to pre-fund a portion of the
Company's contribution to the Allstate 401(k) Savings Plan.   

Equity incentive plans     

         The Company has equity incentive plans under which the Company grants nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units and
performance stock awards ("equity awards") to certain employees and directors of the Company. The Company measures the fair value of equity awards at the award date and recognizes the expense over the
shorter of the period in which the requisite service is rendered or retirement eligibility is attained. The expense for performance stock awards is adjusted each period to reflect the performance
factor most likely to be achieved at the end of the performance period. The Company uses a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of employee stock options.   

Off-balance sheet financial instruments     

         Commitments to invest, commitments to purchase private placement securities, commitments to extend loans, financial guarantees and
credit guarantees have off-balance sheet risk because their contractual amounts are not recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (see Note 7 and Note 14).   

Consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs")     

         The Company consolidates VIEs when it is the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the variable interest holder in a VIE with
both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could
potentially be significant to the VIE.   

Foreign currency translation     

         The local currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is deemed to be the functional currency of the country in which these
subsidiaries operate. The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period for assets and
liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The unrealized gains and losses from the translation of the net assets are recorded as unrealized foreign
currency translation adjustments and included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Changes in unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in operating costs and expenses and have not been material.   

Earnings per common share     

         Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including unvested
participating restricted stock units. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. For the Company,
dilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock options and unvested non-participating restricted stock units and contingently issuable performance stock awards.   

  122  

Table of Contents   

         The
computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31 is presented in the following table.   

The
effect of dilutive potential common shares does not include the effect of options with an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share because their exercise prices exceed the
average market price of Allstate common shares during the period or for which the unrecognized compensation cost would have an anti-dilutive effect. Options to purchase 3.0 million,
8.8 million and 20.4 million Allstate common shares, with exercise prices ranging from $49.96 to $67.61, $40.49 to $62.42 and $26.56 to $62.84, were outstanding in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share in those years.   

Pending accounting standards     

Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects     

         In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance which allows entities that invest in certain
qualified affordable housing projects through limited liability entities the option to account for these investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the
proportional amortization method, the entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance
in the income statement as a component of income tax expense or benefit. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and is to be applied retrospectively.
The impact of adoption is not expected to be material to the Company's results of operations and financial position.   

Revenue from Contracts with Customers     

         In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which revises the criteria for revenue recognition. Insurance contracts are excluded from the
scope of the new guidance. Under the guidance, the transaction price is attributed to underlying performance obligations in the contract and revenue is recognized as
the entity satisfies the performance obligations and transfers control of a good or service to the customer. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract may be capitalized to the extent the entity
expects to recover those costs. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the impact of adoption, which is not expected to be material to the Company's results of operations and financial position.   

Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target
Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period     

         In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the
requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition and should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should reflect the amount
attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has been rendered. Total compensation expense recognized during and after the requisite service period (which may differ from the vesting
period) should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect the number of awards that ultimately vest. The guidance is effective for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015 and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The

  Company's
existing accounting policy for performance targets that affect the vesting of share-based payment awards is consistent with the proposed guidance and as such the impact of adoption is not
expected to affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.   

   3.    Disposition     

         On April 1, 2014, the Company sold Lincoln Benefit Life Company ("LBL"), LBL's life insurance business generated through
independent master brokerage agencies, and all of LBL's deferred fixed annuity and long-term care insurance business to Resolution Life Holdings, Inc. The gross sale price was
$797 million, representing $596 million of cash and the retention of tax benefits. The loss on disposition increased by $101 million, pre-tax, ($60 million, after-tax) in
2014. The loss on disposition in 2014 included a $22 million, pre-tax, reduction in goodwill.   

         In
conjunction with the sale, the Company was required to establish a trust relating to the business that LBL continues to cede to ALIC. This trust is required to have assets greater
than or equal to the statutory reserves ceded by LBL to ALIC, measured on a monthly basis. As of December 31, 2014, the trust holds $5.28 billion of investments, which are reported in
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.   

         The
following table summarizes the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013.   

Included
in shareholders' equity is $85 million of accumulated other comprehensive income related to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2013.   

   4.    Supplemental Cash Flow Information

(1)     The
December 31, 2013 ending balance includes $60 million of cumulative credit losses recognized in earnings for fixed income
securities that are classified as held for sale.    

The
Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to be collected from the fixed income security, discounted at the security's original or current effective rate, as
appropriate, to calculate a recovery value and determine whether a credit loss exists. The determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on facts
and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
supportable assumptions and forecasts, are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected
to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, foreign exchange rates, the financial condition and future
earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, vintage, geographic concentration, available reserves or escrows, current
subordination levels, third party guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, financial condition of the bond
insurer for insured fixed income securities, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used
to estimate recovery value if the Company determines that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement. If the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized
cost of the security, a credit loss exists and an other-than-temporary impairment for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings. The portion of the
unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in accumulated other comprehensive income. If the Company determines that the fixed income security does not have sufficient
cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, the Company may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in
earnings.

Unrealized net capital gains and losses     

         Unrealized net capital gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows:   

(1)     Included
in the fair value of derivative instruments are $3 million classified as assets and $1 million classified as
liabilities.       (2)     Unrealized
net capital gains and losses for limited partnership interests represent the Company's share of EMA limited partnerships' other
comprehensive income. Fair value and gross unrealized gains and losses are not applicable.       (3)     The
insurance reserves adjustment represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the
applicable product portfolios were realized and reinvested at current lower interest rates, resulting in a premium deficiency. Although the Company evaluates premium deficiencies on the combined
performance of life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, the adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, in addition to annuity
buy-outs and certain payout annuities with life contingencies.       (4)     The
DAC and DSI adjustment balance represents the amount by which the amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or decrease if the unrealized
gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized.

Portfolio monitoring     

         The Company has a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security whose
carrying value may be other-than-temporarily impaired.   

         For
each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more
likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets
either of these criteria, the security's decline in fair value is considered other than temporary and is recorded in earnings.   

         If
the Company has not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the fixed income security before
recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company evaluates whether it expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company calculates the
estimated recovery value by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows at the security's original or current effective rate, as appropriate, and compares this to the amortized cost of the
security. If the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, the credit loss component of the impairment is
recorded in earnings, with the remaining amount of the unrealized loss related to other factors recognized in other comprehensive income.   

         For
equity securities, the Company considers various factors, including whether it has the intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover its
cost basis. Where the Company lacks the intent and ability to hold to recovery, or believes the recovery period is extended, the equity security's decline in fair value is considered other than
temporary and is recorded in earnings.   

         For
fixed income and equity securities managed by third parties, either the Company has contractually retained its decision making authority as it pertains to selling securities that are
in an unrealized loss position or it recognizes any unrealized loss at the end of the period through a charge to earnings.   

         The
Company's portfolio monitoring process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost (for
fixed income securities) or cost (for equity securities) is below established thresholds. The process also includes the monitoring of other impairment indicators such as ratings, ratings downgrades
and payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which the Company may have a concern, are evaluated for potential other-than-temporary impairment using all
reasonably available information relevant to the collectability or recovery of the security. Inherent in the Company's evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment for these fixed income and equity
securities are assumptions and estimates about the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer. Some of the factors that may be considered in evaluating whether a decline
in fair value is other than temporary are: 1) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and
trends, geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; 2) the specific reasons that a security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market
conditions which could affect liquidity; and 3) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost or cost.   

  130  

Table of Contents    

         The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses and fair value of fixed income and equity securities by the length of time that individual securities
have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.   

As
of December 31, 2014, $284 million of unrealized losses are related to securities with an unrealized loss position less than 20% of amortized cost or cost, the degree of
which suggests that these securities do not pose a high risk of being other-than-temporarily impaired. Of the $284 million, $130 million are related to unrealized losses on investment
grade fixed income securities. Investment grade is defined as a security having a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody's, a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S P, Fitch, Dominion, Kroll or Realpoint,
a rating of aaa, aa, a or bbb from A.M. Best, or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally
related to increasing risk-free interest rates or widening credit spreads since the time of initial purchase.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, the remaining $85 million of unrealized losses are related to securities in unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to 20% of amortized
cost or cost. Investment grade fixed income securities comprising $28 million of these unrealized losses were evaluated based on factors such as discounted cash flows and the financial
condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations. Of the $85 million, $49 million
are related to below investment grade fixed income securities and $8 million are related to equity securities. Of these amounts, $6 million are related to below investment grade fixed
income securities that had been in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost for a period of twelve or more consecutive months as of December 31, 2014.   

  131  

Table of Contents   

         ABS,
RMBS and CMBS in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on actual and projected collateral losses relative to the securities' positions in the respective securitization
trusts, security specific expectations of cash flows, and credit ratings. This evaluation also takes into consideration credit enhancement, measured in terms of (i) subordination from other
classes of securities in the trust that are contractually obligated to absorb losses before the class of security the Company owns, (ii) the expected impact of other structural features
embedded in the securitization trust beneficial to the class of securities the Company owns, such as
overcollateralization and excess spread, and (iii) for ABS and RMBS in an unrealized loss position, credit enhancements from reliable bond insurers, where applicable. Municipal bonds in an
unrealized loss position were evaluated based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor, obligation type and quality of the underlying assets. Unrealized losses on equity securities are
primarily related to temporary equity market fluctuations of securities that are expected to recover.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, the Company has not made the decision to sell and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell fixed income securities with
unrealized losses before recovery of the amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had the intent and ability to hold equity securities with unrealized losses for a period of
time sufficient for them to recover.   

Limited partnerships     

         As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of equity method limited partnerships totaled $3.41 billion and
$3.52 billion, respectively. The Company recognizes an impairment loss for equity method limited partnerships when evidence demonstrates that the loss is other than temporary. Evidence of a
loss in value that is other than temporary may include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain a level of earnings that
would justify the carrying amount of the investment.   

         As
of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value for cost method limited partnerships was $1.12 billion and $1.44 billion, respectively. To determine if an
other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the Company evaluates whether an impairment indicator has occurred in the period that may have a significant adverse effect on the carrying value of the
investment. Impairment indicators may include: significantly reduced valuations of the investments held by the limited partnerships; actual recent cash flows received being significantly less than
expected cash flows; reduced valuations based on financing completed at a lower value; completed sale of a material underlying investment at a price significantly lower than expected; or any other
adverse events since the last financial statements received that might affect the fair value of the investee's capital. Additionally, the Company's portfolio monitoring process includes a quarterly
review of all cost method limited partnerships to identify instances where the net asset value is below established thresholds for certain periods of time, as well as investments that are performing
below expectations, for further impairment consideration. If a cost method limited partnership is other-than-temporarily impaired, the carrying value is written down to fair value, generally estimated
to be equivalent to the reported net asset value of the underlying funds.   

Tax
credit funds were reclassified from limited partnership interests to other assets during 2014 since the return on these funds is in the form of tax credits rather than investment
income. These tax credit funds totaled $560 million as of December 31, 2014.   

Mortgage loans     

         The Company's mortgage loans are commercial mortgage loans collateralized by a variety of commercial real estate property types located
across the United States and totaled, net of valuation allowance, $4.19 billion and $4.72 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Substantially all of the
commercial mortgage loans are non-recourse to the borrower. The following table shows the principal geographic distribution of commercial real estate represented in the Company's mortgage loan
portfolio. No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio as of December 31.

         The
types of properties collateralizing the mortgage loans as of December 31 are as follows:   

The
contractual maturities of the mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014 are as follows:   

Mortgage
loans are evaluated for impairment on a specific loan basis through a quarterly credit monitoring process and review of key credit quality indicators. Mortgage loans are
considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will not collect the contractual principal and interest. Valuation allowances are established for impaired loans to reduce the carrying value
to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell or the present value of the loan's expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate. Impaired
mortgage loans may not have a valuation allowance when the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell is higher than the carrying value. Valuation allowances are adjusted for subsequent changes
in the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Mortgage loans are charged off against their corresponding valuation allowances when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The
impairment evaluation is non-statistical in respect to the aggregate portfolio but considers facts and circumstances attributable to each loan. It is not considered probable that additional impairment
losses, beyond those identified on a specific loan basis, have been incurred as of December 31, 2014.   

Accrual
of income is suspended for mortgage loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Cash receipts on mortgage
loans on nonaccrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of carrying value.   

         Debt
service coverage ratio is considered a key credit quality indicator when mortgage loans are evaluated for impairment. Debt service coverage ratio represents the amount of estimated
cash flows from the property available to the borrower to meet principal and interest payment obligations. Debt service coverage ratio estimates are updated annually or more frequently if conditions
are warranted based on the Company's credit monitoring process.   

         The
following table reflects the carrying value of non-impaired fixed rate and variable rate mortgage loans summarized by debt service coverage ratio distribution as of
December 31:   

Mortgage
loans with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.0 that are not considered impaired primarily relate to instances where the borrower has the financial capacity to fund the
revenue shortfalls from the properties for the foreseeable term, the decrease in cash flows from the properties is considered temporary, or there are other risk mitigating circumstances such as
additional collateral, escrow balances or borrower guarantees.

         The Company maintains a diversified portfolio of municipal bonds. The following table shows the principal geographic distribution of
municipal bond issuers represented in the Company's portfolio as of December 31. No other state represents more than 5% of the portfolio.   

Concentration of credit risk     

         As of December 31, 2014, the Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer and its affiliates
greater than 10% of the Company's shareholders' equity.   

Securities loaned     

         The Company's business activities include securities lending programs with third parties, mostly large banks. As of December 31,
2014 and 2013, fixed income and equity securities with a carrying value of $755 million and $590 million, respectively, were on loan under these agreements. Interest income on
collateral, net of fees, was $2 million in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012.   

Other investment information     

         Included in fixed income securities are below investment grade assets totaling $6.69 billion and $6.44 billion as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, fixed income securities and short-term investments with a carrying value of $240 million were on deposit with regulatory authorities as required by
law.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, the carrying value of fixed income securities that were non-income producing was $31 million.   

6.    Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities     

         Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable   

  134  

Table of Contents   

  inputs
be used when available. Assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability
of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:   

Level 1:   
     
  Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company can access.  

Level 2:   
      
   Assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:  

(a)  
      
   Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;  

(b)  
      
   Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or  

(c)  
      
   Valuation models whose inputs are observable, directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  

Level 3:   
        
    Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the
Company's estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the assets and liabilities.  

The
availability of observable inputs varies by instrument. In situations where fair value is based on internally developed pricing models or inputs that are unobservable in the market,
the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is typically greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.
In many instances, valuation inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The category level in the fair value hierarchy is determined based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market
disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments.   

         The
Company is responsible for the determination of fair value and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. The Company gains assurance that assets and liabilities are appropriately
valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions,
and compliance with accounting standards. For fair values received from third parties or internally estimated, the Company's processes and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation
methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value, and the fair values are accurately
recorded. For example, on a continuing basis, the Company assesses the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds as compared to
previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models. The Company performs procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes and
controls of valuation service providers. In addition, the Company may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers or brokers to other
third party valuation sources for selected securities. The Company performs ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used in
internal models to market observable data. When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, the Company validates them through reviews by members of management who have relevant
expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions.   

         The
Company has two types of situations where investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The first is where specific inputs significant to the fair value
estimation models are not market observable. This primarily occurs in the Company's use of broker quotes to value certain securities where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market
observable, and the use of valuation models that use significant non-market observable inputs.   

The
second situation where the Company classifies securities in Level 3 is where quotes continue to be received from independent third-party valuation service providers and all
significant inputs are market observable; however, there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity such that the degree
of market observability has declined to a point where categorization as a Level 3 measurement is considered appropriate. The indicators considered in determining whether a significant decrease
in the volume and level of activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, the level of credit spreads over
historical levels, applicable bid-ask spreads, and price consensus among market participants and other pricing sources.   

  135  

Table of Contents   

         Certain
assets are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis, including investments such as mortgage loans, limited partnership interests, bank loans and policy loans. Accordingly,
such investments are only included in the fair value hierarchy disclosure when the investment is subject to remeasurement at fair value after initial recognition and the resulting remeasurement is
reflected in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, derivatives embedded in fixed income securities are not disclosed in the hierarchy as free-standing derivatives since they are
presented with the host contracts in fixed income securities.   

         In
determining fair value, the Company principally uses the market approach which generally utilizes market transaction data for the same or similar instruments. To a lesser extent, the
Company uses the income approach which involves determining fair values from discounted cash flow methodologies. For the majority of Level 2 and Level 3 valuations, a combination of the
market and income approaches is used.   

Summary of significant valuation techniques for assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis     

Level 1 measurements    

Fixed income securities:   Comprise certain U.S. Treasury fixed income securities. Valuation
is based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company can access.   
             Equity securities:   Comprise actively traded, exchange-listed equity securities. Valuation is
based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company can access.   
             Short-term:   Comprise actively traded money market funds that have daily quoted net asset
values for identical assets that the Company can access.   
             Separate account assets:   Comprise actively traded mutual funds that have daily quoted net
asset values for identical assets that the Company can access. Net asset values for the actively traded mutual funds in which the separate account assets are invested are obtained daily from the fund
managers.   
             Assets held for sale:   Comprise U.S. Treasury fixed income securities, short-term investments
and separate account assets. The valuation is based on the respective asset type as described above.    

Level 2 measurements    

Fixed income securities:     

U.S. government and agencies:     The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are
not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.   

   Municipal:     The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active,
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.   

   Corporate, including privately placed:     The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets
that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. Also included are privately placed securities valued using a discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the
financial services industry and uses market observable inputs and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. The primary inputs to the discounted cash flow model
include an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets in markets that are not active that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.   

   Foreign government:     The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not
active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.   

   ABS and RMBS:     The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active,
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral performance and credit spreads. Certain ABS are valued based on non-binding broker quotes whose inputs have been corroborated to
be market observable.   

   CMBS:     The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual
cash flows, benchmark yields, collateral performance and credit spreads.   

   Redeemable preferred stock:     The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are
not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, underlying stock prices and credit spreads.

Equity securities:   The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices or quoted net
asset values for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active.   
             Short-term:   The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or
similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. For certain short-term investments, amortized cost is used as the best estimate of fair
value.   
             Other investments:   Free-standing exchange listed derivatives that are not actively traded
are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active.    

OTC
derivatives, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, certain options and certain credit default swaps, are valued using models that rely on
inputs such as interest rate yield curves, currency rates, and counterparty credit spreads that are observable for substantially the full term of the contract. The valuation techniques underlying the
models are widely accepted in the financial services industry and do not involve significant judgment.   

Assets held for sale:   Comprise U.S. government and agencies, municipal, corporate, foreign
government, ABS, RMBS and CMBS fixed income securities, and short-term investments. The valuation is based on the respective asset type as described above.    

Level 3 measurements    

Fixed income securities:     

Municipal:     Comprise municipal bonds that are not rated by third party credit rating agencies but are rated by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The primary inputs to the valuation of
these municipal bonds include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that exhibit less liquidity relative to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value measurements,
contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. Also included are municipal bonds valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market
observable. Also includes auction rate securities ("ARS") primarily backed by student loans that have become illiquid due to failures in the auction market and are valued using a discounted cash flow
model that is widely accepted in the financial services industry and uses significant non-market observable inputs, including the anticipated date liquidity will return to the market.   

   Corporate, including privately placed:     Primarily valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to
be market observable. Also included are equity-indexed notes which are valued using a discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the financial services industry and uses significant
non-market observable inputs, such as volatility. Other inputs include an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets that incorporate the credit quality and
industry sector of the issuer.   

   ABS, RMBS and CMBS:     Valued based on non-binding broker quotes received from brokers who are familiar with the investments and where the
inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable.   

Equity securities:   The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices or quoted net
asset values for identical or similar assets in markets that exhibit less liquidity relative to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value measurements.   
             Other investments:   Certain OTC derivatives, such as interest rate caps, certain credit
default swaps and certain options (including swaptions), are valued using models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry. These are categorized as Level 3 as a result of the
significance of non-market observable inputs such as volatility. Other primary inputs include interest rate yield curves and credit spreads.   
             Assets held for sale:   Comprise municipal, corporate, ABS and CMBS fixed income securities
that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013. The valuation is based on the respective asset type as described above.   
             Contractholder funds:   Derivatives embedded in certain life and annuity contracts are valued
internally using models widely accepted in the financial services industry that determine a single best estimate of fair value for the embedded derivatives within a block of contractholder
liabilities. The models primarily use stochastically determined cash flows based on the contractual elements of embedded derivatives, projected option cost and applicable market data, such as interest
rate yield curves and equity index volatility assumptions. These are categorized as Level 3 as a result of the significance of non-market observable inputs.    
             Liabilities held for sale:   Comprise derivatives embedded in life and annuity contracts that
were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013. The valuation is the same as described above for contractholder funds.

         If
the projected option cost increased (decreased), it would result in a higher (lower) liability fair value.   

As
of December 31, 2014 and 2013, Level 3 fair value measurements include $1.03 billion and $1.27 billion, respectively, of fixed income securities valued
based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and $169 million and $208 million, respectively, of municipal fixed income
securities that are not rated by third party credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2013, Level 3 fair value measurements for assets held for sale include $319 million of
fixed income securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable. The Company does not develop the unobservable inputs used in
measuring fair value; therefore, these are not included in the table above. However, an increase (decrease) in credit spreads for fixed income securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes
would result in a lower (higher) fair value, and an increase (decrease) in the credit rating of municipal bonds that are not rated by third party credit rating agencies would result in a higher
(lower) fair value.

         Transfers
between level categorizations may occur due to changes in the availability of market observable inputs, which generally are caused by changes in market conditions such as
liquidity, trading volume or bid-ask spreads. Transfers between level categorizations may also occur due to changes in the valuation source. For example, in situations where a fair value quote is not
provided by the Company's independent third-party valuation service provider and as a result the price is stale or has been replaced with a broker quote whose inputs have not been corroborated to be
market observable, the security is transferred into Level 3. Transfers in and out of level categorizations are reported as having occurred at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer
occurred.
Therefore, for all transfers into Level 3, all realized and changes in unrealized gains and losses in the quarter of transfer are reflected in the Level 3 rollforward table.   

There
were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2014 or 2013. During 2012, certain U.S. government securities were transferred into Level 1 from
Level 2 as a result of increased liquidity in the market and a sustained increase in the market activity for these assets.   

         Transfers
into Level 3 during 2014, 2013 and 2012 included situations where a fair value quote was not provided by the Company's independent third-party valuation service provider
and as a result the price was stale or had been replaced with a broker quote where the inputs had not been corroborated to be market observable resulting in the security being classified as
Level 3. Transfers out of Level 3 during 2014, 2013 and 2012 included situations where a broker quote was used in the prior period and a fair value quote became available from the
Company's independent third-party valuation service provider in the current period. A quote utilizing the new pricing source was not available as of the prior period, and any gains or losses related
to the change in valuation source for individual securities were not significant.   

         The
following table provides the change in unrealized gains and losses included in net income for Level 3 assets and liabilities held as of December 31.   

The
amounts in the table above represent the change in unrealized gains and losses included in net income for the period of time that the asset or liability was determined to be in
Level 3. These gains and losses total $19 million in 2014 and are reported as follows: $(3) million in realized capital gains and losses, $12 million in net investment income,
$(5) million in interest credited to contractholder funds and $15 million in life and annuity contract benefits. These gains and losses total $106 million in 2013 and are reported as
follows: $(9) million in realized capital gains and losses, $12 million in net investment income, $35 million in interest credited to contractholder funds, $74 million in life and
annuity contract benefits and $(6) million in loss on disposition of operations. These gains and losses total $151 million in 2012 and are reported as follows: $(37) million in realized capital
gains and losses, $21 million in net investment income, $131 million in interest credited to contractholder funds and $36 million in life and annuity contract benefits.   

         Presented
below are the carrying values and fair value estimates of financial instruments not carried at fair value.   

  144  

Table of Contents   

Financial assets     

The
fair value of mortgage loans, including those classified as assets held for sale, is based on discounted contractual cash flows or, if the loans are impaired due to credit reasons,
the fair value of collateral less costs to sell. Risk adjusted discount rates are selected using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar characteristics, using
similar types of properties as collateral. The fair value of cost method limited partnerships is determined using reported net asset values of the underlying funds. The fair value of bank loans, which
are reported in other investments or assets held for sale, is based on broker quotes from brokers familiar with the loans and current market conditions. The fair value of agent loans, which are
reported in other investments, is based on discounted cash flow calculations that use discount rates with a spread over U.S. Treasury rates. Assumptions used in developing estimated cash flows and
discount rates consider the loan's credit and liquidity risks. The fair value measurements for mortgage loans, cost method limited partnerships, bank loans, agent loans and assets held for sale are
categorized as Level 3.   

Financial liabilities     

The
fair value of contractholder funds on investment contracts, including those classified as liabilities held for sale, is based on the terms of the underlying contracts utilizing
prevailing market rates for similar contracts adjusted for the Company's own credit risk. Deferred annuities included in contractholder funds are valued using discounted cash flow models which
incorporate market value margins, which are based on the cost of holding economic capital, and the Company's own credit risk. Immediate annuities without life contingencies and fixed rate funding
agreements are valued at the present value of future benefits using market implied interest rates which include the Company's own credit risk. The fair value measurements for contractholder funds on
investment contracts and liabilities held for sale are categorized as Level 3.   

         The
fair value of long-term debt is based on market observable data (such as the fair value of the debt when traded as an asset) or, in certain cases, is determined using discounted cash
flow calculations based on current interest rates for instruments with comparable terms and considers the Company's own credit risk. The liability for collateral is valued at carrying value due to its
short-term nature. The fair value measurements for long-term debt and liability for collateral are categorized as Level 2.   

   7.    Derivative Financial Instruments and Off-balance sheet Financial Instruments     

         The Company uses derivatives to manage risks with certain assets and liabilities arising from the potential adverse impacts from changes in risk-free interest
rates, changes in equity market valuations, increases in credit spreads and foreign currency fluctuations, and for asset replication.   

         Property-Liability
uses interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures and options to manage the interest rate risks of existing investments. Portfolio duration management is a risk management
strategy that is principally employed by Property-Liability wherein financial futures and interest rate swaps are utilized to change the duration of the portfolio in order to offset the economic
effect that interest rates would otherwise have on the fair value of its fixed income securities. Equity index futures and options are used by Property-Liability to offset valuation losses in the
equity portfolio during periods of declining equity market values. Credit default swaps are typically used to mitigate the credit risk within the Property-Liability fixed income portfolio.
Property-Liability uses equity futures to hedge the market risk   

  145  

Table of Contents   

  related
to deferred compensation liability contracts and forward contracts to hedge foreign currency risk associated with holding foreign currency denominated investments and foreign operations.   

         Asset-liability
management is a risk management strategy that is principally employed by Allstate Financial to balance the respective interest-rate sensitivities of its assets and
liabilities. Depending upon the attributes of the assets acquired and liabilities issued, derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, swaptions and futures are utilized to change the
interest rate characteristics of existing assets and liabilities to ensure the relationship is maintained within specified ranges and to reduce exposure to rising or falling interest rates. Allstate
Financial uses financial futures and interest rate swaps to hedge anticipated asset purchases and liability issuances and futures and options for hedging the equity exposure contained in its equity
indexed life and annuity product contracts that offer equity returns to contractholders. In addition, Allstate Financial uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk inherent in funding
agreements. Allstate Financial uses foreign currency swaps and forwards primarily to reduce the foreign currency risk associated with holding foreign currency denominated investments. Credit default
swaps are typically used to mitigate the credit risk within the Allstate Financial fixed income portfolio.   

The
Company may also use derivatives to manage the risk associated with corporate actions, including the sale of a business. During 2014 and December 2013, swaptions were utilized to
hedge the expected proceeds from the disposition of LBL.   

         Asset
replication refers to the "synthetic" creation of assets through the use of derivatives and primarily investment grade host bonds to replicate securities that are either
unavailable in the cash markets or more economical to acquire in synthetic form. The Company replicates fixed income securities using a combination of a credit default swap and one or more highly
rated fixed income securities to synthetically replicate the economic characteristics of one or more cash market securities.   

The
Company also has derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are required to be separated from the host contracts and accounted for at fair value with changes in fair
value of embedded derivatives reported in net income. The Company's primary embedded derivatives are equity options in life and annuity product contracts, which provide equity returns to
contractholders; conversion options in fixed income securities, which provide the Company with the right to convert the instrument into a predetermined number of shares of common stock; credit default
swaps in synthetic collateralized debt obligations, which provide enhanced coupon rates as a result of selling credit protection; and equity-indexed notes containing equity call options, which provide
a coupon payout that is determined using one or more equity-based indices.   

         When
derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow
hedges. Allstate Financial designates certain of its interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and certain investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements as fair value hedges when the hedging
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Allstate Financial designates certain of its foreign currency swap contracts as cash flow hedges
when the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the exposure of variations in cash flows for the hedged risk that could affect net income. Amounts are reclassified to net investment
income or realized capital gains and losses as the hedged item affects net income.   

         The
notional amounts specified in the contracts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are generally not representative of the potential for
gain or loss on these agreements. However, the notional amounts specified in credit default swaps where the Company has sold credit protection represent the maximum amount of potential loss, assuming
no recoveries.   

         Fair
value, which is equal to the carrying value, is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date. The carrying
value amounts for OTC derivatives are further adjusted for the effects, if any, of enforceable master netting agreements and are presented on a net basis, by counterparty agreement, in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For certain exchange traded and cleared derivatives, margin deposits are required as well as daily cash settlements of margin accounts. As of
December 31, 2014, the Company pledged $41 million of cash and securities in the form of margin deposits.   

For
those derivatives which qualify for fair value hedge accounting, net income includes the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged risk, and
therefore reflects any hedging ineffectiveness. For cash flow hedges, gains and losses are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income and are reported in net income in the same period the
forecasted transactions being hedged impact net income.   

  146  

Table of Contents    

         Non-hedge accounting is generally used for "portfolio" level hedging strategies where the terms of the individual hedged items do not meet the strict homogeneity
requirements to permit the application of hedge accounting. For non-hedge derivatives, net income includes changes in fair value and accrued periodic settlements, when applicable. With the exception
of non-hedge derivatives used for asset replication and non-hedge embedded derivatives, all of the Company's derivatives are evaluated for their ongoing effectiveness as either accounting hedge or
non-hedge derivative financial instruments on at least a quarterly basis.

Table of Contents   

  the
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31. In 2014 and 2013, the Company had no derivatives used in fair value hedging relationships.   

Changes
in fair value of the Company's fair value hedging relationships for 2012 resulted in a $3 million gain on interest rate contract derivatives and a $3 million loss
on the hedged risk of investments, both of which were reported in net investment income.   

         The
Company manages its exposure to credit risk by utilizing highly rated counterparties, establishing risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master netting agreements
("MNAs") and obtaining collateral where appropriate. The Company uses MNAs for OTC derivative transactions that permit either party to net payments due for transactions and collateral is either
pledged or obtained when certain predetermined exposure limits are exceeded. As of December 31, 2014, counterparties pledged $4 million in cash and securities to the Company, and the
Company pledged $25 million in cash and securities to counterparties which includes $7 million of collateral posted under MNAs for contracts containing credit-risk-contingent provisions
that are in a liability position and
$18 million of collateral posted under MNAs for contracts without credit-risk-contingent liabilities. The Company has not incurred any losses on derivative financial instruments due to
counterparty nonperformance. Other derivatives, including futures and certain option contracts, are traded on organized exchanges which require margin deposits and guarantee the execution of trades,
thereby mitigating any potential credit risk.   

         Counterparty
credit exposure represents the Company's potential loss if all of the counterparties concurrently fail to perform under the contractual terms of the contracts and all
collateral, if any, becomes worthless. This exposure is   

  150  

Table of Contents   

  measured
by the fair value of OTC derivative contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date reduced by the effect, if any, of legally enforceable master netting agreements.   

         The
following table summarizes the counterparty credit exposure as of December 31 by counterparty credit rating as it relates to the Company's OTC derivatives.   

(1)     Rating
is the lower of S P or Moody's ratings.       (2)     Only
OTC derivatives with a net positive fair value are included for each counterparty.    

Market
risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk exists for all of the derivative financial instruments the
Company currently holds, as these instruments may become less valuable due to adverse changes in market conditions. To limit this risk, the Company's senior management has established risk control
limits. In addition, changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments that the Company uses for risk management purposes are generally offset by the change in the fair value or cash flows
of the hedged risk component of the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.   

Certain
of the Company's derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent termination events, cross-default provisions and credit support annex agreements. Credit-risk-contingent
termination events allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative on certain dates if AIC's, ALIC's or Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York's ("ALNY") financial strength credit ratings by
Moody's or S P fall below a certain level or in the event AIC, ALIC or ALNY are no longer rated by either Moody's or S P. Credit-risk-contingent cross-default provisions allow the counterparties to
terminate the derivative instruments if the Company defaults by pre-determined threshold amounts on certain debt instruments. Credit-risk-contingent credit support annex agreements specify the amount
of collateral the Company must post to counterparties based on AIC's, ALIC's or ALNY's financial strength credit ratings by Moody's or S P, or in the event AIC, ALIC or ALNY are no longer rated by
either Moody's or S P.   

         The
following summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments with termination, cross-default or collateral credit-risk-contingent features that are in a liability position as of
December 31, as well as the fair value of assets and collateral that are netted against the liability in accordance with provisions within legally enforceable MNAs.

Credit derivatives   selling protection     

         Free-standing credit default swaps ("CDS") are utilized for selling credit protection against a specified credit event. A credit
default swap is a derivative instrument, representing an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit risk of a specified entity (or a group of entities), or an index based on the credit risk
of a group of entities (all commonly referred to as the "reference entity" or a portfolio of "reference entities"), in return for a periodic premium. In selling protection, CDS are used to replicate
fixed income securities and to complement the cash market when credit exposure to certain issuers is not available or when the derivative alternative is less expensive than the cash market
alternative. CDS typically have a five-year term.   

  151  

Table of Contents    

         The following table shows the CDS notional amounts by credit rating and fair value of protection sold.   

In
selling protection with CDS, the Company sells credit protection on an identified single name, a basket of names in a first-to-default ("FTD") structure or credit derivative index
("CDX") that is generally investment grade, and in return receives periodic premiums through expiration or termination of the agreement. With single name CDS, this premium or credit spread generally
corresponds to the difference between the yield on the reference entity's public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates at the time the agreement is executed. With a FTD basket, because of the
additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named reference entities, the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the basket and the
correlation between the names. CDX is utilized to take a position on multiple (generally 125) reference entities. Credit events are typically defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or restructuring,
depending on the nature of the reference entities. If a credit event occurs, the Company settles with the counterparty, either through physical settlement or cash settlement. In a physical settlement,
a reference asset is delivered by the buyer of protection to the Company, in exchange for cash payment at par, whereas in a cash settlement, the Company pays the difference between par and the
prescribed value of the reference asset. When a credit event occurs in a single name or FTD basket (for FTD, the first credit event occurring for any one name in the basket), the contract terminates
at the time of settlement. For CDX, the reference entity's name incurring the credit event is removed from the index while the contract continues until expiration. The maximum payout on a CDS is the
contract notional amount. A physical settlement may afford the Company with recovery rights as the new owner of the asset.   

         The
Company monitors risk associated with credit derivatives through individual name credit limits at both a credit derivative and a combined cash instrument/credit derivative level. The
ratings of individual names for which protection has been sold are also monitored.   

Off-balance sheet financial instruments     

         The contractual amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31 are as follows:   

In
the preceding table, the contractual amounts represent the amount at risk if the contract is fully drawn upon, the counterparty defaults and the value of any underlying security
becomes worthless. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk.

         Commitments
to invest in limited partnership interests represent agreements to acquire new or additional participation in certain limited partnership investments. The Company enters into
these agreements in the normal course of business. Because the investments in limited partnerships are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate the fair value of these commitments.   

Commitments
to extend mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company enters into these
agreements to commit to future loan fundings at a predetermined interest rate. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The fair value of commitments to extend
mortgage loans, which are secured by the underlying properties, is $1 million as of December 31, 2014, and is valued based on estimates of fees charged by other institutions to make
similar commitments to similar borrowers.   

         Private
placement commitments represent conditional commitments to purchase private placement debt and equity securities at a specified future date. The Company enters into these
agreements in the normal course of business. The fair value of these commitments generally cannot be estimated on the date the commitment is made as the terms and conditions of the underlying private
placement securities are not yet final.   

         Other
loan commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company enters into these agreements to
commit to future loan fundings at predetermined interest rates. Commitments generally have varying expiration dates or other termination clauses. The fair value of these commitments is insignificant.   

   8.    Reserve for Property-Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense     

The Company establishes reserves for claims and claims expense on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. The Company's reserving process takes into
account known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including the Company's experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and
pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic conditions. In the normal course of
business, the Company may also supplement its claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, and other professionals and information sources to assess and
settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.   

Because
reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of losses that have occurred, including incurred but not reported ("IBNR") losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including
reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimates. The
highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses incurred in the current reporting period as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled.
The Company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve
estimates, which may be material, are reported in property-liability insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined.   

  153  

Table of Contents   

         Activity
in the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is summarized as follows:   

(1)     The
Esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in 2012 resulting in a reduction in reserves due to lower severity. The
adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense.    

Incurred
claims and claims expense represents the sum of paid losses and reserve changes in the calendar year. This expense includes losses from catastrophes of $1.99 billion,
$1.25 billion and $2.35 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, net of reinsurance and other recoveries (see Note 10). Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the
property-liability insurance business that have contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company's results of operations and financial position.   

The
Company calculates and records a single best reserve estimate for losses from catastrophes, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards. As a result, management
believes that no other estimate is better than the recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, including the factors described above, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from
recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimates. Accordingly, management believes that it is not practical to develop a meaningful range for any such changes in losses incurred.   

         During
2014, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of net decreases in auto reserves of $238 million primarily due to claim severity
development that was better than expected, net increases in homeowners reserves of $29 million due to unfavorable catastrophe reserve reestimates, net increases in other reserves of
$13 million, and net increases in Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves of $112 million. Incurred claims and claims expense includes unfavorable catastrophe loss reestimates of
$43 million, net of reinsurance and other recoveries.   

         During
2013, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of net decreases in auto reserves of $237 million primarily due to claim severity
development that was better than expected, net decreases in homeowners reserves of $5 million due to favorable non-catastrophe reserve reestimates, net decreases in other reserves of
$21 million, and net increases in Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves of $142 million. Incurred claims and claims expense includes favorable catastrophe loss reestimates of
$88 million, net of reinsurance and other recoveries.   

         During
2012, incurred claims and claims expense related to prior years was primarily composed of net decreases in auto reserves of $365 million primarily due to claim severity
development that was better than expected, net decreases in homeowners reserves of $321 million due to favorable catastrophe reserve reestimates, net decreases in other reserves of
$30 million, and net increases in Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves of $51 million. Incurred claims and claims expense includes favorable catastrophe loss reestimates of
$410 million, net of reinsurance and other recoveries.   

         Management
believes that the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, net of reinsurance recoverables, is appropriately established in the aggregate and
adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of reported and

Insurance Company of America, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. (collectively "Prudential").    

To
the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities would result in a premium deficiency had those gains actually been realized, a premium deficiency reserve is recorded for
certain immediate annuities with life contingencies. A liability of $28 million is included in the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits with respect to this deficiency as of
December 31, 2014. The offset to this liability is recorded as a reduction of the unrealized net capital gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The liability was zero as of
December 31, 2013.

Contractholder
funds include funding agreements held by VIEs issuing medium-term notes. The VIEs are Allstate Life Funding, LLC and Allstate Life Global Funding, and their primary
assets are funding agreements used exclusively to back medium-term note programs.

Table of Contents   

         Contractholder
funds activity for the years ended December 31 is as follows:   

The
Company offered various guarantees to variable annuity contractholders. Liabilities for variable contract guarantees related to death benefits are included in the reserve for
life-contingent contract benefits and the liabilities related to the income, withdrawal and accumulation benefits are included in contractholder funds. All liabilities for variable contract guarantees
are reported on a gross basis on the balance sheet with a corresponding reinsurance recoverable asset for those contracts subject to reinsurance. In 2006, the Company disposed of substantially all of
its variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with Prudential.   

         Absent
any contract provision wherein the Company guarantees either a minimum return or account value upon death, a specified contract anniversary date, partial withdrawal or
annuitization, variable annuity and variable life insurance contractholders bear the investment risk that the separate accounts' funds may not meet their stated investment objectives. The account
balances of variable annuities contracts' separate accounts with guarantees included $3.82 billion and $5.20 billion of equity, fixed income and balanced mutual funds and
$467 million and $748 million of money market mutual funds as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   

         The
table below presents information regarding the Company's variable annuity contracts with guarantees. The Company's variable annuity contracts may offer more than one type of
guarantee in each contract; therefore, the sum of amounts listed exceeds the total account balances of variable annuity contracts' separate accounts with guarantees.   

(1)     Defined
as the estimated current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account balance as of the balance sheet date.      (2)     Defined
as the estimated present value of the guaranteed minimum annuity payments in excess of the current account balance.    

157  

Table of Contents   

(3)     Defined
as the estimated current guaranteed minimum withdrawal balance (initial deposit) in excess of the current account balance as of the
balance sheet date.       (4)     Defined
as the estimated present value of the guaranteed minimum accumulation balance in excess of the current account balance.    

The
liability for death and income benefit guarantees is equal to a benefit ratio multiplied by the cumulative contract charges earned, plus accrued interest less contract excess
guarantee benefit payments. The benefit ratio is calculated as the estimated present value of all expected contract excess guarantee benefits divided by the present value of all expected contract
charges. The establishment of reserves for these guarantees requires the projection of future fund values, mortality, persistency and customer benefit utilization rates. These assumptions are
periodically reviewed and updated. For guarantees related to death benefits, benefits represent the projected excess guaranteed minimum death benefit payments. For guarantees related to income
benefits, benefits represent the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuitization benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the time of annuitization.   

         Projected
benefits and contract charges used in determining the liability for certain guarantees are developed using models and stochastic scenarios that are also used in the development
of estimated expected gross profits.
Underlying assumptions for the liability related to income benefits include assumed future annuitization elections based on factors such as the extent of benefit to the potential annuitant,
eligibility conditions and the annuitant's attained age. The liability for guarantees is re-evaluated periodically, and adjustments are made to the liability balance through a charge or credit to life
and annuity contract benefits.   

         Guarantees
related to the majority of withdrawal and accumulation benefits are considered to be derivative financial instruments; therefore, the liability for these benefits is
established based on its fair value.   

         The
following table summarizes the liabilities for guarantees:   

(1)     Included
in the total liability balance as of December 31, 2013 are reserves for variable annuity death benefits of $98 million,
variable annuity income benefits of $99 million, variable annuity accumulation benefits of $43 million, variable annuity withdrawal benefits of $13 million and other guarantees of
$302 million.       (2)     Included
in the total liability balance as of December 31, 2014 are reserves for variable annuity death benefits of $96 million,
variable annuity income benefits of $92 million, variable annuity accumulation benefits of $32 million, variable annuity withdrawal benefits of $13 million and other guarantees of
$117 million.       (3)     Included
in the total liability balance as of December 31, 2012 are reserves for variable annuity death benefits of
$112 million, variable annuity income benefits of $221 million, variable annuity accumulation benefits of $86 million, variable annuity withdrawal benefits of $39 million
and other guarantees of $215 million.

   10.  Reinsurance     

The effects of reinsurance on property-liability insurance premiums written and earned and life and annuity premiums and contract charges for the years ended
December 31 are as follows:   

Property-Liability     

         The Company purchases reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of
coverage. Developments in the insurance and reinsurance industries have fostered a movement to segregate asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities
with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. The Company is unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectability
of reinsurance recoverables in the future.   

Property-Liability reinsurance recoverable     

         Total amounts recoverable from reinsurers as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $5.78 billion and $4.75 billion,
respectively, including $89 million and $85 million, respectively, related to property-liability losses paid by the Company and billed to reinsurers, and $5.69 billion and
$4.66 billion, respectively, estimated by the Company with respect to ceded unpaid losses (including IBNR), which are not billable until the losses are paid.   

         With
the exception of the recoverable balances from the Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA"), Lloyd's of London, New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund ("NJUCJF") and
other industry pools and facilities, the largest reinsurance recoverable balance the Company had outstanding was $65 million and $85 million from Westport Insurance Corporation (formerly
Employers' Reinsurance Company) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other amount due or estimated to be due from any single property-liability reinsurer was in excess of
$34 million as of both December 31, 2014 and 2013.   

         The
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $95 million and $92 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is primarily related to the Company's
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.   

Industry pools and facilities     

         Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims including IBNR as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes $4.42 billion
and $3.46 billion, respectively, from the MCCA. The MCCA is a mandatory insurance coverage and reinsurance indemnification mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides
indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year. The retention level is $530 thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2015
and 2014. The MCCA operates similar to a reinsurance program and is funded by participating companies through a per vehicle annual assessment. This assessment is included in the premiums charged to
the Company's customers and when collected, the Company remits the assessment to the MCCA. These assessments provide funds for the indemnification for losses described above. The MCCA is required to
assess an amount each year sufficient to cover lifetime claims of all persons catastrophically injured in that year, its operating expenses, and adjustments for the amount for excesses or deficiencies
in prior assessments. The MCCA prepares

granted the MCCA a statutory permitted practice that expires in 2016 to discount its liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expense. As of June 30, 2014, the date of its most recent annual
financial report, the permitted practice reduced the MCCA's accumulated deficit by $51.24 billion to $411 million.

current retention of $69 million for the 2 largest hurricanes and $23 million for other hurricanes, up to a maximum total of $184 million effective from June 1, 2014 to
May 31, 2015. There were no amounts recoverable from the FHCF as of December 31, 2014 or 2013.   

Catastrophe reinsurance     

         The Company has the following catastrophe reinsurance agreements in effect as of December 31, 2014:   

         The
Nationwide Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance program (the "Nationwide program") comprising four agreements: The Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement,
the 2013-1 Property Claim Services ("PCS") Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement, the 2014-1 PCS Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement, and the Buffer Layer Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance
agreement.   

The Per Occurrence Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprises seventeen contracts placed in six layers and incepting as of
June 1, 2014. Coverage for each of the first through fifth layers comprises three contracts with one, two and three year terms expiring May 31, 2015, May 31, 2016 and
May 31, 2017. Coverage for the sixth layer comprises two contracts with two and three year terms expiring May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2017. This agreement reinsures Allstate
Protection for personal lines property and automobile excess catastrophe losses countrywide, in all states except Florida and New Jersey, caused by multiple perils. Each of the layers is 95% placed
and subject to reinstatement. The agreement covers $2.95 billion in per occurrence losses subject to a $500 million retention.   
            The 2013-1 PCS Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprises two contracts: a Class B Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance
contract that constitutes a portion of the seventh layer and provides $150 million in limits excess of a $2.95 billion retention, and a Class A Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance
contract which constitutes a portion of the ninth layer of the Nationwide program and provides $200 million in limits excess of a $3.5 billion retention. The agreement reinsures Allstate
Protection for personal lines property and automobile excess catastrophe losses caused by hurricanes in 28 states and the District of Columbia, and earthquakes, including fires following earthquakes,
in California, New York and Washington. The contracts' risk period began May 4, 2013 and expires on May 3, 2017. The contracts do not include a reinstatement of limits.    
            The 2014-1 PCS Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprises three contracts: a Class D Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance

and a Class B Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance contract which constitutes the tenth layer of the Nationwide program and provides $330 million in limits excess of a $3.83 billion
attachment level. The agreement reinsures Allstate Protection for personal lines property and automobile excess catastrophe losses caused by hurricanes in 29 states and the District of Columbia, and    
 
  160

earthquakes,
including fires following earthquakes, in California, New York, and Washington. The contracts were effective on May 22, 2014 with the risk period for the Class D Excess
Catastrophe Reinsurance contract expiring on May 22, 2019, and the risk periods for the Class C Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance contract and the Class B Excess Catastrophe
Reinsurance contract expiring on May 22, 2018. The contracts do not include a reinstatement of limits.   

The Buffer Layer Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprises the eighth layer of the Nationwide program and includes one
three-year term contract that provides an annual limit of $63 million of reinsurance limits excess of a $3.44 billion retention and is 95% placed. The contract reinsures Allstate
Protection for personal lines property and automobile excess catastrophe losses caused by multiple perils in all states except Florida and New Jersey. Annually, the retention and limit of the
agreement may be adjusted, within limits, to more closely align with the reset attachment and exhaustion levels of the 2013-1 PCS Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement. The contract does not
include a reinstatement of limits.    

Losses
recoverable under the Company's New Jersey, Kentucky and Pennsylvania reinsurance agreements, described below, are disregarded when determining coverage under the contracts
included in the Nationwide program.   

The New Jersey Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprises three contracts. One contract expires May 31, 2015 and
provides coverage for Allstate Protection personal lines property excess catastrophe losses for multiple perils in New Jersey. The contract provides 32% of a $400 million limit excess of a
$144 million retention. Two contracts, expiring May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2017, provide 32% of a $400 million limit excess of a $156 million retention and 32% of a
$400 million limit excess of a $150 million retention, respectively. The contracts reinsure personal lines property and automobile excess catastrophe losses in New Jersey. All contracts
contain one reinstatement of limits each year. The reinsurance premium and retention applicable to the agreement are subject to redetermination for exposure changes annually.   
            The Kentucky Earthquake Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement provides coverage for Allstate Protection personal lines property
excess catastrophe losses in the state for earthquakes and fires following earthquakes effective June 1, 2014 to May 31, 2017. The agreement provides three limits of $25 million
excess of a $5 million retention subject to two limits being available in any one contract year and is 95% placed.   
            The Pennsylvania Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement provides coverage for Allstate Protection personal lines property excess
catastrophe losses in the state for multi-perils effective June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2015. The agreement provides three limits of $100 million excess of a $100 million
retention subject to two limits being available in any one contract year and is 95% placed.   
            The Florida Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement comprises six contracts and includes our subsidiaries Castle Key Insurance
Company ("CKIC") and Castle Key Indemnity Company's ("CKI", and together with CKIC, "Castle Key") participation in the mandatory Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"). The agreement reinsures
Castle Key for personal lines property excess catastrophe losses in Florida. All contracts constituting the agreement, except one, the Sanders Re 2014-2 contract, provide a one year term effective
June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 with reinsurance premium subject to redetermination for exposure changes. The Sanders Re 2014-2 contract is a three-year term contract with a risk
period effective June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017. With the exception of the mandatory FHCF contracts and the Sanders Re 2014-2 contract, all contracts provide reinsurance for
qualifying losses to personal lines property arising out of multiple perils in addition to hurricanes. The mandatory FHCF contracts reinsure qualifying personal lines property losses caused by storms
the National Hurricane Center declares to be hurricanes, and the Sanders Re 2014-2 contract reinsures qualifying losses to personal lines property caused by a named storm event, a severe thunderstorm
event, or an earthquake event. These events are defined in the Sanders Re 2014-2 contract as events declared by various reporting agencies, including PCS, and in the case of a severe thunderstorm
event, should PCS cease to report on severe thunderstorms, then such event will be deemed a severe thunderstorm if Castle Key has assigned a catastrophe code to such severe thunderstorm. All contracts
composing the Florida Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance agreement, including the mandatory FHCF contracts, provide an estimated provisional limit of $732 million excess of a provisional
$15 million retention.    

The
Company ceded premiums earned of $437 million, $471 million and $531 million under catastrophe reinsurance agreements in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Asbestos, environmental and other     

         Reinsurance recoverables include $202 million and $191 million from Lloyd's of London as of December 31, 2014 and
2013, respectively. Lloyd's of London, through the creation of Equitas Limited, implemented a restructuring to solidify its capital base and to segregate claims for years prior to 1993. In 2007,
Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, assumed responsibility for the Equitas claim liabilities through a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement and continues to runoff
the Equitas claims.   

Allstate Financial     

         The Company's Allstate Financial segment reinsures certain of its risks to other insurers primarily under yearly renewable term,
coinsurance, modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld agreements. These agreements result in a passing of the agreed-upon percentage of risk to the reinsurer in exchange for negotiated
reinsurance premium payments. Modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld are similar to coinsurance, except that the cash and investments that support the liability for contract benefits
are not transferred to the assuming company and settlements are made on a net basis between the companies.   

For
certain term life insurance policies issued prior to October 2009, Allstate Financial ceded up to 90% of the mortality risk depending on the year of policy issuance under coinsurance
agreements to a pool of fourteen unaffiliated reinsurers. Effective October 2009, mortality risk on term business is ceded under yearly renewable term agreements under which Allstate Financial cedes
mortality in excess of its retention, which is consistent with how Allstate Financial generally reinsures its permanent life insurance business. The following table summarizes those retention limits
by period of policy issuance.   

Period    
     
   Retention limits    

April 2011 through current  
     
  Single life: $5 million per life, $3 million age 70 and over, and $10 million for contracts that meet specific criteria 
Joint life: $8 million per life, and $10 million for contracts that meet specific criteria  

July 2007 through March 2011  
      
   $5 million per life, $3 million age 70 and over, and $10 million for contracts that meet specific criteria  

September 1998 through June 2007  
      
   $2 million per life, in 2006 the limit was increased to $5 million for instances when specific criteria were met  

August 1998 and prior  
      
   Up to $1 million per life  

In
addition, Allstate Financial has used reinsurance to effect the disposition of certain blocks of business. Allstate Financial had reinsurance recoverables of $1.46 billion and
$1.51 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, due from Prudential related to the disposal of substantially all of its variable annuity business that was effected through
reinsurance agreements. In 2014, life and annuity premiums and contract charges of $109 million, contract benefits of $36 million, interest credited to contractholder funds of
$21 million, and operating costs and expenses of $20 million were ceded to Prudential. In 2013, life and annuity premiums and contract charges of $120 million, contract benefits
of $139 million, interest credited to contractholder funds of $22 million, and operating costs and expenses of $23 million were ceded to Prudential. In 2012, life and annuity
premiums and contract charges of $128 million, contract benefits of $91 million, interest credited to contractholder funds of $23 million, and operating costs and expenses of
$25 million were ceded to Prudential. In addition, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 Allstate Financial had reinsurance recoverables of $118 million and $156 million,
respectively, due from subsidiaries of Citigroup (Triton Insurance and American Health and Life Insurance) and Scottish Re (U.S.) Inc. in connection with the disposition of substantially all of
the direct response distribution business in 2003.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, the gross life insurance in force was $426.19 billion of which $98.16 billion was ceded to the unaffiliated reinsurers.

Notes are subject to redemption at the Company's option in whole or in part at any time at the greater of either 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date or the discounted sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest and accrued and unpaid interest
to the redemption date.       (2)     The
Company classifies any borrowings which have a maturity of twelve months or less at inception as short-term debt.    

164  

Table of Contents   

         Debt
maturities for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2014 are as follows:   

During
2014 and 2013, the Company repurchased principal amounts of $10 million and $1.90 billion, respectively, of debt. The Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of
$1 million, pre-tax, and $491 million, pre-tax, in 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing the excess of the repurchase price over the principal repaid, the write-off of the
unamortized debt issuance costs and other costs related to the repurchase transactions.   

The
Subordinated Debentures may be redeemed (i) in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after January 15, 2023 for the 5.10% Subordinated Debentures and
August 15, 2023 for the 5.75% Subordinated Debentures at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption; provided that if the Subordinated
Debentures are not redeemed in whole, at least $25 million aggregate principal amount must remain outstanding, or (ii) in whole, but not in part, prior to January 15, 2023 for the
5.10% Subordinated Debentures and August 15, 2023 for the 5.75% Subordinated Debentures, within 90 days after the occurrence of certain tax and rating agency events, at their principal
amount or, if greater, a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The 5.75% Subordinated Debentures have this make-whole redemption
price provision only when a reduction of equity credit assigned by a rating agency has occurred.   

         Interest
on the 5.10% Subordinated Debentures is payable quarterly at the stated fixed annual rate to January 14, 2023, or any earlier redemption date, and then at an annual rate
equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 3.165%. Interest on the 5.75% Subordinated Debentures is payable semi-annually at the stated fixed annual rate to August 14, 2023, or any earlier redemption
date, and then quarterly at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.938%. The Company may elect to defer payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures for one or more consecutive
interest periods that do not exceed five years. During a deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures at the then-applicable rate and deferred interest will
compound on each interest payment date. If all deferred interest on the Subordinated Debentures is paid, the Company can again defer interest payments.   

         The
Company has outstanding $500 million of Series A 6.50% and $252 million of Series B 6.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures (together
the "Debentures"). The scheduled maturity dates for the Debentures are May 15, 2057 and May 15, 2037 for Series A and Series B, respectively, with a final maturity date of
May 15, 2067. The Debentures may be redeemed (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2037 or May 15, 2017 for Series A and Series B,
respectively, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to May 15, 2037 and
May 15, 2017 for Series A and Series B, respectively, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price.   

         Interest
on the Debentures is payable semi-annually at the stated fixed annual rate to May 15, 2037 and May 15, 2017 for Series A and Series B, respectively,
and then payable quarterly at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.12% and 1.935% for Series A and Series B, respectively. The Company may elect at one or more times to
defer payment of interest on the Debentures for one or more consecutive interest periods that do not exceed 10 years. Interest compounds during such deferral periods at the rate in effect for
each period. The interest deferral feature obligates the Company in certain circumstances to issue common stock or certain other types of securities if it cannot otherwise raise sufficient funds to
make the required interest payments. The Company has reserved 75 million shares of its authorized and unissued common stock to satisfy this obligation.   

         The
terms of the Company's outstanding subordinated debentures prohibit the Company from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on common or preferred stock or redeeming,
purchasing, acquiring, or making liquidation payments on common stock or preferred stock if the Company has elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain
limited exceptions.   

         In
connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company entered into replacement capital covenants ("RCCs"). These covenants were not intended for the benefit of the holders of
the Debentures and could not be enforced   

  165

  by
them. Rather, they were for the benefit of holders of one or more other designated series of the Company's indebtedness ("covered debt"), currently the 6.75% Senior Debentures due 2018. Pursuant to
the RCCs, the Company has agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the Debentures on or before May 15, 2067 and May 15, 2047 for Series A and Series B,
respectively, (or such earlier date on which the RCCs terminate by their terms) unless, subject to certain limitations, the Company has received net cash proceeds in specified amounts from the sale of
common stock or certain other qualifying securities. The promises and covenants contained in the RCC will not apply if (i) S P upgrades the Company's issuer credit rating to A or above,
(ii) the Company redeems the Debentures due to a tax event, (iii) after notice of redemption has been given by the Company and a market disruption event occurs preventing the Company
from raising proceeds in accordance with the RCCs, or (iv) if the Company repurchases or redeems up to 10% of the outstanding principal of the Debentures in any one-year period, provided that
no more than 25% will be so repurchased, redeemed or purchased in any ten-year period.   

         The
RCCs terminate in 2067 and 2047 for Series A and Series B, respectively. The RCCs will terminate prior to their scheduled termination date if (i) the applicable
series of Debentures is no longer outstanding and the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the RCCs or they are no longer applicable, (ii) the holders of a majority of the
then-outstanding principal amount of the then-effective series of covered debt consent to agree to the termination of the RCCs, (iii) the Company does not have any series of outstanding debt
that is eligible to be treated as covered debt under the RCCs, (iv) the applicable series of Debentures is accelerated as a result of an event of default, (v) certain rating agency or
change in control events occur, (vi) S P, or any successor thereto, no longer assigns a solicited rating on senior debt issued or guaranteed by the Company, or (vii) the termination of
the RCCs would have no effect on the equity credit provided by S P with respect to the Debentures. An event of default, as defined by the supplemental indenture, includes default in the payment of
interest or principal and bankruptcy proceedings.   

         The
Company previously was the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE used to acquire automotive collision repair stores ("synthetic lease") by its Sterling Collision
Centers, Inc. subsidiary. The Company's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position included $29 million of property and equipment, net and $44 million of long-term debt as of
December 31, 2013 related to the synthetic lease. In 2014, the Company repaid the synthetic lease long-term debt in conjunction with the sale of Sterling Collision Centers, Inc.   

         To
manage short-term liquidity, the Company maintains a commercial paper program and a credit facility as a potential source of funds. These include a $1.00 billion unsecured
revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion. In April 2014, the Company amended the maturity date of the facility to April 2019 and also
amended the option to extend the expiration by one year at the first and second anniversary of the amendment, upon approval of existing or replacement lenders. This facility contains an increase
provision that would allow up to an additional $500 million of borrowing. This facility has a financial covenant requiring the Company not to exceed a 37.5% debt to capitalization ratio as
defined in the agreement. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the
ratings of the Company's senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility
cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2014 or 2013. The Company had no commercial
paper outstanding as of December 31, 2014 or 2013.   

         The
Company paid $332 million, $361 million and $366 million of interest on debt in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

         During
2012, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that expires in 2015. The registration statement covers an
unspecified amount of securities and can be used to issue debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and securities of
trust subsidiaries.   

Common stock     

         The Company had 900 million shares of issued common stock of which 418 million shares were outstanding and
482 million shares were held in treasury as of December 31, 2014. In 2014, the
Company reacquired 39 million shares at an average cost of $59.21 and reissued 8 million net shares under equity incentive plans.

Preferred stock     

         The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding preferred stock as of December 31, 2014. All represent noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock with a $1.00 par value per share and a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share.   

In
March 2014, the Company issued 29,900 shares of 6.625% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E, for gross proceeds of $747.5 million. In June 2014, the Company
issued 10,000 shares of 6.25% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F, for gross proceeds of $250 million. The proceeds of both issuances were used for general corporate
purposes.   

         The
preferred stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and liquidation rights. The Company will pay dividends on the preferred stock on a
noncumulative basis only when, as and if declared by the Company's board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) and to the extent that the Company has legally available funds to
pay dividends. If dividends are declared on the preferred stock, they will be payable quarterly in arrears at an annual fixed rate. Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, in
the event dividends are not declared on the preferred stock for payment on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to be payable. If the Company has not declared a dividend before
the dividend payment date for any dividend period, the Company has no obligation to pay dividends for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period. No
dividends may be paid or declared on the Company's common stock and no shares of the Company's common stock may be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on the
preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for.   

         The
Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on preferred stock in excess of the amount of net proceeds from an issuance of common stock taking place within
90 days before a dividend declaration date if, on that dividend declaration date, either: (1) the risk-based capital ratios of the largest U.S. property-casualty insurance subsidiaries
that collectively account for 80% or more of the net written premiums of U.S. property-casualty insurance business on a weighted average basis were less than 175% of their company action level
risk-based capital as of the end of the most recent year; or (2) consolidated net income for the four-quarter period ending on the preliminary quarter end test date (the quarter that is two
quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter) is zero or negative and consolidated shareholders' equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, and subject to certain other
adjustments relating to changes in U.S. GAAP) as of each of the preliminary quarter test date and the most recently completed quarter has declined by 20% or more from its level as measured at
the end of the benchmark quarter (the date that is ten quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter). If the Company fails to satisfy either of these tests on any dividend declaration date,
the restrictions on dividends will continue until the Company is able again to satisfy the test on a dividend declaration date. In addition, in the case of a restriction arising under
(2) above, the restrictions on dividends will continue until consolidated shareholders' equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, and subject to certain other adjustments
relating to changes in U.S. GAAP) has increased, or has declined by less than 20%, in either case as compared to its level at the end of the benchmark quarter for each dividend payment date as
to which dividend restrictions were imposed.   

         The
preferred stock does not have voting rights except with respect to certain changes in the terms of the preferred stock, in the case of certain dividend nonpayments, certain other
fundamental corporate events, mergers or consolidations and as otherwise provided by law. If and when dividends have not been declared and paid in full for at least six quarterly dividend periods or
their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will be increased by two. The holders of the preferred stock, together with
the holders of all other affected classes and series of voting parity stock, voting as a single class, will be entitled to elect the two additional members of the board of directors of the Company,
subject to certain conditions. The board of directors shall at no time have more than two preferred stock directors.

         The preferred stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. The preferred stock is redeemable at the Company's option in whole or in part, on or after
June 15, 2018 for Series A, October 15, 2018 for Series C, April 15, 2019 for Series D and E, and October 15, 2019 for Series F, at a redemption

of certain rating agency events at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share or, if greater, a make-whole redemption price, plus declared and unpaid dividends.   

   13.  Company Restructuring     

         The Company undertakes various programs to reduce expenses. These programs generally involve a reduction in staffing levels, and in certain cases, office
closures. Restructuring and related charges include employee termination and relocation benefits, and post-exit rent expenses in connection with these programs, and non-cash charges resulting from
pension benefit payments made to agents in connection with the 1999 reorganization of
Allstate's multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program. The expenses related to these activities are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as restructuring and
related charges, and totaled $18 million, $70 million and $34 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

The
following table presents changes in the restructuring liability in 2014.   

The
payments applied against the liability for employee costs primarily reflect severance costs, and the payments for exit costs generally consist of post-exit rent expenses and contract
termination penalties. As of December 31, 2014, the cumulative amount incurred to date for active programs totaled $92 million for employee costs and $56 million for exit costs.   

   14.  Commitments, Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities     

Leases     

         The Company leases certain office facilities and computer equipment. Total rent expense for all leases was $187 million,
$192 million and $243 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

Minimum
rental commitments under noncancelable capital and operating leases with an initial or remaining term of more than one year as of December 31, 2014 are as follows:   

Shared markets and state facility assessments     

         The Company is required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations in various
states that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which
tend to be   

  168  

Table of Contents   

  adverse,
have been immaterial to the Company's results of operations. Because of the Company's participation, it may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and/or
assessments from these facilities.   

Florida Citizens     

         Castle Key is subject to assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the state of Florida ("FL Citizens"), which
was initially created by the state of Florida to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. FL Citizens, at the discretion and direction of its
Board of Governors ("FL Citizens Board"), can levy a regular assessment on assessable insurers and assessable insureds for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of: 2%
of the projected deficit or 2% of the aggregate statewide direct written premium for the prior calendar year. The base of assessable insurers includes all property and casualty premiums in the state,
except workers' compensation, medical malpractice, accident and health insurance and policies written under the NFIP. An insurer may recoup a regular assessment through a surcharge to policyholders.
In order to recoup this assessment, an insurer must file for a policy surcharge with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation ("FL OIR") at least fifteen days prior to imposing the surcharge
on policies. If a deficit remains after the regular assessment, FL Citizens can also levy emergency assessments in the current and subsequent years. Companies are required to collect the emergency
assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit to FL Citizens as collected.   

Louisiana Citizens     

         The Company is also subject to assessments from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("LA Citizens"). LA Citizens
can levy a regular assessment on participating companies for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of 10% of the calendar year deficit or 10% of Louisiana direct property
premiums industry-wide for the prior calendar year.   

Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund     

         Castle Key participates in the mandatory coverage provided by the FHCF and therefore has access to reimbursements on certain qualifying
Florida hurricane losses from the FHCF (see Note 10), has exposure to assessments and pays annual premiums to the FHCF for this reimbursement protection. The FHCF has the authority to issue
bonds to pay its obligations to insurers participating in the mandatory coverage in excess of its capital balances. Payment of these bonds is funded by emergency assessments on all property and
casualty premiums in the state, except workers' compensation, medical malpractice, accident and health insurance and policies written under the NFIP. The FHCF emergency assessments are limited to 6%
of premiums per year beginning the first year in which reimbursements require bonding, and up to a total of 10% of premiums per year for assessments in the second and subsequent years, if required to
fund additional bonding. The FHCF issued $625 million in bonds in 2008, and the FL OIR ordered an emergency assessment of 1% of premiums collected for all policies renewed January 1,
2007 through December 31, 2010. The FHCF issued $676 million in bonds in 2010 and the FL OIR ordered an emergency assessment of 1.3% of premiums collected for all policies written or
renewed January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2014. The FHCF issued $2 billion in pre-event bonds in 2013 to build their capacity to reimburse member companies' claims. The FHCF
plans to fund these pre-event bonds through current FHCF cash flows.   

         Facilities
such as FL Citizens, LA Citizens and the FHCF are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders; however, the exposure to assessments from these
facilities and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases may not offset each other in the Company's financial statements. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not
offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases, as well as the possibility of policies not
being renewed in subsequent years.   

California Earthquake Authority     

         Exposure to certain potential losses from earthquakes in California is limited by the Company's participation in the California
Earthquake Authority ("CEA"), which provides insurance for California earthquake losses. The CEA is a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for
earthquake damage. Insurers selling homeowners insurance in California are required to offer earthquake insurance to their customers either through their company or by participation in the CEA. The
Company's homeowners policies continue to include coverages for losses caused by explosions, theft, glass breakage and fires following an earthquake, which are not underwritten by the CEA.   

         As
of September 30, 2014, the CEA's capital balance was approximately $4.68 billion. Should losses arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, additional funding
would be obtained from the proceeds of revenue bonds the   

  169  

Table of Contents   

  CEA
may issue, an existing $3.56 billion reinsurance layer, and finally, if needed, assessments on participating insurance companies. Participating insurers are required to pay an assessment,
currently estimated not to exceed $1.66 billion, if the capital of the CEA falls below $350 million. Participating insurers are required to pay a second additional assessment, currently
estimated not to exceed $312 million, if aggregate CEA earthquake losses exceed $10.52 billion and the capital of the CEA falls below $350 million. Within the limits previously
described, the assessment could be intended to restore the CEA's capital to a level of $350 million. There is no provision that allows insurers to recover assessments through a premium
surcharge or other mechanism. The CEA's projected aggregate claim paying capacity is $10.52 billion as of September 30, 2014 and if an event were to result in claims greater than its
capacity, affected policyholders may be paid a prorated portion of their covered losses, paid on an installment basis, or no payments may be made if the claim paying capacity of the CEA is
insufficient.   

         All
future assessments on participating CEA insurers are based on their CEA insurance market share as of December 31 of the preceding year. As of December 31, 2013, the
Company's market share of the CEA was 13.9%. The Company does not expect its CEA market share to materially change. At this level, the Company's maximum possible CEA assessment would be
$273 million during 2015. These amounts are re-evaluated by the board of directors of the CEA on an annual basis. Accordingly, assessments from the CEA for a particular quarter or annual period
may be material to the results of operations and cash flows, but not the financial position of the Company. Management believes the Company's exposure to earthquake losses in California has been
significantly reduced as a result of its participation in the CEA.   

Texas Windstorm Insurance Association     

         The Company participates as a member of the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association ("TWIA") which provides wind and hail coverage to
coastal risks unable to procure coverage in the voluntary market. Wind and hail coverage is written on a TWIA-issued policy. Under current law, as amended in 2009, to the extent losses exceed premiums
and reinsurance, TWIA follows a funding structure first utilizing funds set aside from periods (including prior years) in which premiums exceeded losses. Once those funds and available reinsurance are
utilized, TWIA will issue up to $1 billion of securities, 30% of which will be repaid by participating insurers assessments and 70% of which will be repaid by surcharges on coastal property
policies. After those funds are depleted, TWIA can issue $500 million of securities which will be repaid by participating insurer assessments. Participating companies' maximum assessment is
capped at $800 million annually. The Company's current participation ratio is approximately 13% based upon its proportion of the premiums written. The TWIA board has not indicated the
likelihood of any possible future assessments to insurers at this time. However, assessments from TWIA for a particular quarter or annual period may be material to the results of operations and cash
flows, but not the financial position of the Company.   

New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund     

         The NJUCJF provides compensation to qualified claimants for bodily injury or death caused by private passenger automobiles operated by
uninsured or "hit and run" drivers. The fund also provides reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in excess of $75,000 with no limits
for policies issued or renewed prior to January 1, 1991 and in excess of $75,000 and capped at $250,000 for policies issued or renewed from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2004.
NJUCJF expenses are assessed on companies writing motor vehicle liability insurance in New Jersey annually based on their private passenger and commercial automobile written premiums. The NJUCJF was
merged into the New Jersey Property Liability Guaranty Association who collects the assessments. Assessments to the Company totaled $9 million in 2014.   

North Carolina Reinsurance Facility     

         The North Carolina Reinsurance Facility ("NCRF") provides automobile liability insurance to drivers that insurers are not otherwise
willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write automobile insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCRF. The Company also collects NCRF surcharges on all automobile policies written in the
state. Premium, losses and expenses ceded to the NCRF and surcharges are remitted to the state. The NCRF results are shared by the member companies in proportion to their respective North Carolina
automobile liability writings. Member companies are assessed or collect based on their participation ratios which are determined annually. As of September 30, 2014, the NCRF reported a surplus
of $15 million in members' equity to cover future losses.   

North Carolina Joint Underwriters Association     

         The North Carolina Joint Underwriters Association ("NCJUA") was created to provide property insurance for properties that insurers are
not otherwise willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write property insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCJUA. Premiums, losses and expenses of the NCJUA are shared by the member   

  170  

Table of Contents   

  companies
in proportion to their respective North Carolina property insurance writings. Member companies are assessed when plan deficits occur, or collect based on their participation ratios, which
are determined annually. As of December 31, 2014, the Company has a $3 million receivable from the NCJUA reflecting a plan surplus from all open years.   

North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association     

         The North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association ("NCIUA") provides windstorm and hail coverage as well as homeowners policies for
properties located in the state's beach and coastal areas that insurers are not otherwise willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write residential and commercial property insurance in North
Carolina are members of the NCIUA. Members are assessed in proportion to their North Carolina residential and commercial property insurance writings, which is determined annually and varies by
coverage, for plan deficits. The plan currently has a surplus. No member company shall be entitled to the distribution of any portion of the Association's surplus. Legislation in 2009 capped insurers'
assessments for losses incurred in any year at $1 billion. Subsequent to an industry assessment of $1 billion, if the plan continues to require funding, it may authorize insurers to
assess a 10% surcharge on each property insurance policy statewide to be remitted to the plan.   

Guaranty funds     

         Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, for certain
obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Amounts assessed to each company are typically related to its proportion of business written in each state. The Company's
policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and
the
related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. In certain states
there must also be a final order of liquidation. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the liability balance included in other liabilities and accrued expenses was $16 million and
$36 million, respectively. The related premium tax offsets included in other assets were $15 million and $31 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   

PMI runoff support agreement     

         The Company has certain limited rights and obligations under a capital support agreement ("Runoff Support Agreement") with PMI Mortgage
Insurance Company ("PMI"), the primary operating subsidiary of PMI Group, related to the Company's disposition of PMI in prior years. Under the Runoff Support Agreement, the Company would be required
to pay claims on PMI policies written prior to October 28, 1994 if PMI fails certain financial covenants and fails to pay such claims. The agreement only covers these policies and not any
policies issued on or after that date. In the event any amounts are so paid, the Company would receive a commensurate amount of preferred stock or subordinated debt of PMI Group or PMI. The Runoff
Support Agreement also restricts PMI's ability to write new business and pay dividends under certain circumstances. On October 20, 2011, the Director of the Arizona Department of Insurance took
control of the PMI insurance companies; effective October 24, 2011, the Director instituted a partial claim payment plan: claim payments will be made at 50%, with the remaining amount deferred
as a policyholder claim. In 2014, the Director increased the partial payments to 67%. The effect of these developments to the Company is uncertain. The Company has not received any notices or requests
for payments under this agreement. Management does not believe these developments will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.   

Guarantees     

         The Company provides residual value guarantees on Company leased automobiles. If all outstanding leases were terminated effective
December 31, 2014, the Company's maximum obligation pursuant to these guarantees, assuming the automobiles have no residual value, would be $32 million as of December 31, 2014.
The remaining term of each residual value guarantee is equal to the term of the underlying lease that ranges from less than one year to three years. Historically, the Company has not made any material
payments pursuant to these guarantees.   

         The
Company owns certain investments that obligate the Company to exchange credit risk or to forfeit principal due, depending on the nature or occurrence of specified credit events for
the reference entities. In the event all such specified credit events were to occur, the Company's maximum amount at risk on these investments, as measured by the amount of the aggregate initial
investment, was $4 million as of December 31, 2014. The obligations associated with these investments expire at various dates on or before March 11, 2018.   

Related
to the sale of LBL on April 1, 2014, ALIC has agreed to indemnify Resolution Life Holdings, Inc. related to representations, warranties and covenants of ALIC, as
well as for certain liabilities specifically excluded from the   

  171  

Table of Contents   

  transaction,
subject to certain contractual limitations as to ALIC's maximum obligation. Indemnifications related to representations and warranties made by ALIC will expire by March 31, 2015,
except for those pertaining to certain tax items. Management does not believe these indemnification provisions will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of
the Company.   

         Related
to the disposal through reinsurance of substantially all of Allstate Financial's variable annuity business to Prudential in 2006, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries,
ALIC and ALNY, have agreed to indemnify Prudential for certain pre-closing contingent liabilities (including extra-contractual liabilities of ALIC and ALNY and liabilities specifically excluded from
the transaction) that ALIC and ALNY have agreed to retain. In addition, the Company, ALIC and ALNY will each indemnify Prudential for certain post-closing liabilities that may arise from the acts of
ALIC, ALNY and their agents, including certain liabilities arising from ALIC's and ALNY's provision of transition services. The reinsurance agreements contain no limitations or indemnifications with
regard to insurance risk transfer, and transferred all of the future risks and responsibilities for performance on the underlying variable annuity contracts to Prudential, including those related to
benefit guarantees. Management does not believe this agreement will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.   

         In
the normal course of business, the Company provides standard indemnifications to contractual counterparties in connection with numerous transactions, including acquisitions and
divestitures. The types of indemnifications typically provided include indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain other liabilities, such as third party
lawsuits. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. The terms
of the indemnifications vary in duration and nature. In many cases, the maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and
are not expected to occur. Consequently, the maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications is not determinable. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to
these obligations.   

         The
aggregate liability balance related to all guarantees was not material as of December 31, 2014.   

Regulation and Compliance     

         The Company is subject to extensive laws, regulations, administrative directives, and regulatory actions. From time to time, regulatory
authorities or legislative bodies seek to influence and restrict premium rates, require premium refunds to policyholders, require reinstatement of terminated policies, restrict the ability of insurers
to cancel or non-renew policies, require insurers to continue to write new policies or limit their ability to write new policies, limit insurers' ability to change coverage terms or to impose
underwriting standards, impose additional regulations regarding agent and broker compensation, regulate the nature of and amount of investments, impose fines and penalties for unintended errors or
mistakes, and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. In addition, the Company is subject to laws and regulations administered and enforced by federal
agencies and other organizations, including but not limited to the SEC, the FINRA, the EEOC, and the U.S. Department of Justice. The Company has established procedures and policies to facilitate
compliance with laws and regulations, to foster prudent business operations, and to support financial reporting. The Company routinely reviews its practices to validate compliance with laws and
regulations and with
internal procedures and policies. As a result of these reviews, from time to time the Company may decide to modify some of its procedures and policies. Such modifications, and the reviews that led to
them, may be accompanied by payments being made and costs being incurred. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these actions on the Company's business, if any, are uncertain.   

Legal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries     

         The Company and certain subsidiaries are involved in a number of lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings arising
out of various aspects of its business.   

Background      

         These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities,
including the underlying facts of each matter; novel legal issues; variations between jurisdictions in which matters are being litigated, heard, or investigated; differences in applicable laws and
judicial interpretations; the length of time before many of these matters might be resolved by settlement, through litigation, or otherwise; the fact that some of the lawsuits are putative class
actions in which a class has not been certified and in which the purported class may not be clearly defined; the fact that some of the lawsuits involve multi-state class actions in which the
applicable law(s) for the claims at issue is in dispute and therefore unclear; and the current challenging legal environment faced by large corporations and insurance companies.   

  172  

Table of Contents   

         The
outcome of these matters may be affected by decisions, verdicts, and settlements, and the timing of such decisions, verdicts, and settlements, in other individual and class action
lawsuits that involve the Company, other insurers, or other entities and by other legal, governmental, and regulatory actions that involve the Company, other insurers, or other entities. The outcome
may also be affected by future state or federal legislation, the timing or substance of which cannot be predicted.   

         In
the lawsuits, plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies which may include equitable relief in the form of injunctive and other remedies and monetary relief in the form of contractual and
extra-contractual damages. In some cases, the monetary damages sought may include punitive or treble damages. Often specific information about the relief sought, such as the amount of damages, is not
available because plaintiffs have not requested specific relief in their pleadings. When specific monetary demands are made, they are often set just below a state court jurisdictional limit in order
to seek the maximum amount available in state court, regardless of the specifics of the case, while still avoiding the risk of removal to federal court. In Allstate's experience, monetary demands in
pleadings bear little relation to the ultimate loss, if any, to the Company.   

         In
connection with regulatory examinations and proceedings, government authorities may seek various forms of relief, including penalties, restitution, and changes in business practices.
The Company may not be advised of the nature and extent of relief sought until the final stages of the examination or proceeding.   

Accrual and disclosure policy      

         The Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate
accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for such matters at management's best estimate when the Company assesses that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not establish accruals for such matters when the Company does not believe both that it is probable that
a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company's assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the
ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals. The Company does not include potential recoveries in its estimates of reasonably possible or probable losses. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.   

         The
Company continues to monitor its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings for further developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and
estimable, and accordingly accruable, or that could affect the amount of accruals that have been previously established. There may continue to be exposure to loss in excess of any amount accrued.
Disclosure of the nature and amount of an accrual is made when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company's ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by
the disclosure of the amount of accrual.   

         When
the Company assesses it is reasonably possible or probable that a loss has been incurred, it discloses the matter. When it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or
range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for the matters disclosed, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Disclosure is not required when an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or
range of loss cannot be made.   

         For
certain of the matters described below in the "Claims related proceedings" and "Other proceedings" subsections, the Company is able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range
of loss above the amount accrued, if any. In determining whether it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, the Company reviews and evaluates the disclosed matters, in
conjunction with counsel, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.   

         These
developments may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, information obtained from other sources,
experience from managing these and other matters, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. When the Company possesses sufficient appropriate information to develop an estimate of the
reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or
reasonably possible but such an estimate is not possible. Disclosure of the estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for any individual matter would
only be considered when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company's ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by the disclosure of the individual
estimate.   

         The
Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if any, for the disclosed matters where such an estimate is possible
is zero to $690 million, pre-tax. This disclosure is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Under accounting guidance, an event is "reasonably possible" if   

  173  

Table of Contents   

  "the
chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely" and an event is "remote" if "the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight." This estimate
is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimate will change
from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimate does not include matters or losses for which an estimate is not possible. Therefore, this estimate
represents an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Company's maximum possible loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the
nature of all of the disclosed matters and, where specified, the amount, if any, of plaintiff claims associated with these loss contingencies.   

         Due
to the complexity and scope of the matters disclosed in the "Claims related proceedings" and "Other proceedings" subsections below and the many uncertainties that exist, the ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and
may be material to the Company's operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to it, management believes that the ultimate
outcome of all matters described below, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.   

Claims related proceedings      

         Allstate is vigorously defending a class action lawsuit in Montana state court challenging aspects of its claim handling practices in
Montana. The plaintiff alleges that the Company adjusts claims made by individuals who do not have attorneys in a manner that unfairly resulted in lower payments compared to claimants who were
represented by attorneys. In January 2012, the court certified a class of Montana claimants who were not represented by attorneys with respect to the resolution of auto accident claims. The court
certified the class to cover an indefinite period that commences in the mid-1990's. The certified claims include claims for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and punitive damages in an
unspecified amount. Injunctive relief may include a claim process by which unrepresented claimants could request that their claims be readjusted. No compensatory damages are sought on behalf of the
class. The Company appealed the order certifying the class. In August 2013, the Montana Supreme Court affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the lower court's order granting plaintiff's motion for
class certification and remanded the case for trial. The Company petitioned for rehearing of the Montana Supreme Court's decision, which the Court denied. In January 2014, the Company timely filed a
petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Montana Supreme Court's decision. On May 5, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of
certiorari. The case will continue in Montana state court. To date no discovery has occurred related to the
potential value of the class members' claims. The Company has asserted various defenses with respect to the plaintiff's claims, which have not been finally resolved. In the Company's judgment a loss
is not probable.   

         The
Company is vigorously litigating two class action cases in California in which the plaintiffs allege off-the-clock wage and hour claims. One case, involving two classes, is pending
in Los Angeles Superior Court and was filed in December 2007. In this case, one class includes auto physical damage adjusters employed in the state of California from January 1, 2005 to the
date of final judgment, to the extent the Company failed to pay for off-the-clock work to those adjusters who performed certain duties prior to their first assignments. The other class includes all
non-exempt employees in California from December 19, 2006 until January 2010 who received pay statements from Allstate which allegedly did not comply with California law. The other case was
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in September 2010. In April 2012, the trial court certified the class, and Allstate appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals. On September 3, 2014, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision to certify the class, and Allstate filed a motion for rehearing en banc. Allstate's motion for rehearing en
banc was denied and on January 27, 2015, Allstate filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition to off-the-clock claims, the plaintiffs in this case allege
other California Labor Code violations resulting from purported unpaid overtime. The class in this case includes all adjusters in the state of California from September 29, 2006 to final
judgment. Plaintiffs in both cases seek recovery of unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, penalties, and attorneys' fees and costs. In addition to the California class actions, a case was filed in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that no-fault claim adjusters have been improperly classified as exempt employees under New York Labor Law and the Fair Labor
Standards Act. The case was filed in April 2011, and the plaintiffs are seeking unpaid wages, liquidated damages, injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. On
September 16, 2014, the court certified a class of no-fault adjusters under New York Labor Law and refused to decertify a Fair Labor Standards Act class of no-fault adjusters. In the Company's
judgment a loss is not probable.

Other proceedings      

         The Company is vigorously defending certain matters in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania relating to the
Company's agency program reorganization announced in 1999. The current focus in these matters relates to a release of claims signed by the vast majority of agents who were participants in the
reorganization program. These matters include the following:   

           Romero I:       In 2001, approximately 32 former employee agents, on behalf of a putative class of approximately 6,300 former employee agents,
filed a
putative class action alleging claims for age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), interference with benefits under ERISA, breach of contract, and breach of
fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs also assert a claim for a declaratory judgment that the release of claims constitutes unlawful retaliation and should be set aside. Plaintiffs seek broad but unspecified
"make whole relief," including back pay, compensatory and punitive damages, liquidated damages, lost investment capital, attorneys' fees and costs, and equitable relief, including reinstatement to
employee agent status with all attendant benefits.   

           Romero II:       A putative nationwide class action was also filed in 2001 by former employee agents alleging various violations of ERISA
("   Romero II   "). This action has been consolidated with    Romero I.    The    Romero
II    plaintiffs, most of whom are also plaintiffs in    Romero I,    are challenging certain amendments to the Agents Pension Plan and
seek to have service as exclusive agent independent contractors count toward eligibility for benefits under the Agents Pension Plan. Plaintiffs seek broad but unspecified "make whole" or other
equitable relief, including loss of benefits as a result of their conversion to exclusive agent independent contractor status or retirement from the Company between November 1, 1999 and
December 31, 2000. They also seek repeal of the challenged amendments to the Agents Pension Plan with all attendant benefits revised and recalculated for thousands of former employee agents,
and attorneys' fees and costs. The court granted the Company's initial motion to dismiss the complaint. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that dismissal and remanded for further proceedings.   

           Romero I and II consolidated proceedings:       In 2004, the court ruled that the release was voidable and certified classes of agents, including a
mandatory class of agents who had signed the release, for purposes of effecting the court's declaratory judgment that the release was voidable. In 2007, the court vacated its ruling and granted the
Company's motion for summary judgment on all claims. Plaintiffs appealed and in July 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the trial court's entry of summary judgment in the
Company's favor, remanded the case to the trial court for additional discovery, and instructed the trial court to first address the validity of the release after additional discovery. Following the
completion of discovery limited to the validity of the release, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment with respect to the validity of the release. On February 28, 2014, the trial
court denied plaintiffs' and the Company's motions for summary judgment, concluding that the question of whether the releases were knowingly and voluntarily signed under a totality of circumstances
test raised disputed issues of fact to be resolved at trial. Among other things, the court also held that the release, if valid, would bar all claims in    Romero I and
II.    On May 23, 2014, plaintiffs moved to certify a class as to certain issues relating to the validity of the release. The court denied plaintiffs' class certification
motion on October 6, 2014, stating, among other things, that individual factors and circumstances must be considered to determine whether each release signer entered into the release knowingly
and voluntarily. The court entered an order on December 11, 2014, (a) stating that the court's October 6, 2014 denial of class certification as to release-related issues did not
resolve whether issues relating to the merits of plaintiffs' claims may be subject to class certification at a later time, and (b) holding that the court's October 6, 2014 order
restarted the running of the statute of limitation for any former employee agent who wished to challenge the validity of the release. In an order entered January 7, 2015, the court denied
reconsideration of its December 11, 2014 order and clarified that all statutes of limitations to challenge the release would resume running on March 2, 2015. Trial proceedings are
scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2015 for individual plaintiffs to determine the question of whether their releases were knowingly and voluntarily signed.   

           EEOC I:       In 2001, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") filed suit alleging that Allstate's use of a release in the
reorganization
constituted retaliation under federal civil rights laws. The EEOC's suit was consolidated with    Romero I    and    Romero
II   . On March 13, 2014, the trial court denied EEOC's motion for summary judgment and granted Allstate's motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor
of Allstate. The EEOC appealed this decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court's final judgment in Allstate's favor on February 13, 2015.   

         Based
on the trial court's February 28, 2014 order in    Romero I    and    II,    if the
validity of the release is decided in favor of the Company, that would preclude any damages or other relief being awarded in    Romero I    and     Romero II   . The
final resolution of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and complexities including how individual trials and possible
appeals with respect to the validity of the release will be resolved and how the appeal from summary judgment   

  175  

Table of Contents   

  in
the Company's favor in    EEOC I    will be resolved. Depending upon how these issues are resolved, the Company may or may not have to address the merits
of plaintiffs' claims relating to the reorganization and amendments to the Agents Pension Plan described herein. In the Company's judgment, a loss is not probable.   

Asbestos and environmental     

         Allstate's reserves for asbestos claims were $1.01 billion and $1.02 billion, net of reinsurance recoverables of
$478 million and $478 million, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Reserves for environmental claims were $203 million and $208 million, net of
reinsurance recoverables of $64 million and $60 million, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately 57% and 55% of the total net asbestos and environmental
reserves as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were for incurred but not reported estimated losses.   

Management
believes its net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and
regulations. However, establishing net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other
types of claims. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimate. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long
reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the
determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs' evolving and expanding theories of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance;
retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos
producers and other asbestos defendants; and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are
covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and
sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to
defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. Management believes these
issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. In addition,
while the Company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in its ability to estimate asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these
refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable losses. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to
develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.   

15.  Income Taxes     

         The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Tax liabilities and benefits realized by the consolidated group
are allocated as generated by the respective entities.   

         The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is currently examining the Company's 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns. The IRS has completed its examination of the Company's 2009 and 2010
federal income tax returns and a final settlement related to the examination was approved by the IRS Appeals Division on September 19, 2014. The Company's tax years prior to 2009 have been
examined by the IRS and the statute of limitations has expired on those years. Any adjustments that may result from IRS examinations of the Company's tax returns are not expected to have a material
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.   

         The
reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

         The
Company believes it is reasonably possible that the liability balance will not significantly increase within the next twelve months. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to impact the Company's effective tax rate.   

         The
Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company did not record interest income or expense relating to unrecognized tax
benefits in income tax expense in 2014, 2013 or 2012. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, there was no interest accrued with respect to unrecognized tax benefits. No amounts have been accrued for
penalties.   

         The
components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:   

Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the Company's assessment that the deductions
ultimately recognized for tax purposes will be fully utilized.   

         As
of December 31, 2014, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of $94 million which will expire at the end of 2024 through 2029.   

         The
components of income tax expense for the years ended December 31 are as follows:   

The
Company paid income taxes of $1.07 billion, $500 million and $280 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company had current income tax payable of
$158 million and $203 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

16.  Statutory Financial Information and Dividend Limitations     

         Allstate's domestic property-liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include a variety of publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws,
regulations and general administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices not so prescribed.   

         All
states require domiciled insurance companies to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, subject to any
deviations prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance commissioner and/or director. Statutory accounting practices differ from GAAP primarily since they require charging policy acquisition
and certain sales inducement costs to expense as incurred, establishing life insurance reserves based on different actuarial assumptions, and valuing certain investments and establishing deferred
taxes on a different basis.   

         Statutory
net income and capital and surplus of Allstate's domestic insurance subsidiaries, determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
insurance regulatory authorities are as follows:   

(1)     The
Property-Liability statutory capital and surplus balances exclude wholly-owned subsidiaries included in the Allstate Financial segment.    

Dividend Limitations     

         There are no regulatory restrictions that limit the payment of dividends by the Corporation, except those generally applicable to
corporations incorporated in Delaware. Dividends are payable only out of certain components of shareholders' equity as permitted by Delaware law. However, the ability of the Corporation to pay
dividends is dependent on business conditions, income, cash requirements of the Company, receipt of dividends from AIC and other relevant factors.   

The
payment of shareholder dividends by AIC without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance ("IL DOI") is limited to formula amounts based on net income and
capital and surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting practices, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. AIC paid dividends of
$2.47 billion in 2014. The maximum amount of dividends AIC will be able to pay without prior IL DOI approval at a given point in time during 2015 is $2.31 billion, less dividends paid
during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. The payment of a dividend in excess of this amount requires 30 days advance written notice to the IL DOI. The dividend is
deemed approved, unless the IL DOI disapproves it within the 30 day notice period. Additionally, any dividend must be paid out of unassigned surplus excluding unrealized appreciation from
investments, which for AIC totaled $11.76 billion as of December 31, 2014, and cannot result in capital and surplus being less than the minimum amount required by law.   

  178  

Table of Contents    

         Under state insurance laws, insurance companies are required to maintain paid up capital of not less than the minimum capital requirement applicable to the types
of insurance they are authorized to write. Insurance companies are also subject to risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements adopted by state insurance regulators. A company's "authorized control level
RBC" is calculated using various factors applied to certain financial balances and activity. Companies that do not maintain statutory capital and surplus at a level in excess of the company action
level RBC, which is two times authorized control level RBC, are required to take specified actions. Company action level RBC is significantly in excess of the minimum capital requirements. Total
statutory capital and surplus and authorized control level RBC of AIC were $16.97 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. Substantially all of the Corporation's
insurance subsidiaries are subsidiaries of and/or reinsure all of their business to AIC, including ALIC. The subsidiaries are included as a component of AIC's total statutory capital and surplus.   

         The
amount of restricted net assets, as represented by the Corporation's investment in its insurance subsidiaries, was $24 billion as of December 31, 2014.   

Intercompany transactions     

         Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the IL DOI for transactions that exceed a level that
is based on a formula using statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.   

   17.  Benefit Plans     

Pension and other postretirement plans     

         Defined benefit pension plans cover most full-time employees, certain part-time employees and employee-agents. Benefits under the
pension plans are based upon the employee's length of service, eligible annual compensation and, prior to January 1, 2014, either a cash balance or final average pay formula. A cash balance
formula applies to all eligible employees hired after August 1, 2002. Eligible employees hired before August 1, 2002 chose between the cash balance formula and the final average pay
formula. In July 2013, the Company amended its primary plans effective January 1, 2014 to introduce a new cash balance formula to replace the previous formulas (including the final average pay
formula and the previous cash balance formula) under which eligible employees accrue benefits.   

         The
Company also provides a medical coverage subsidy for eligible employees hired before January 1, 2003, including their eligible dependents, when they retire and certain life
insurance benefits for eligible retirees ("postretirement benefits"). In July 2013, the Company amended the plan to eliminate the life insurance benefits effective January 1, 2014 for current
eligible employees and effective January 1, 2016 for eligible retirees who retired after 1989. Qualified employees may become eligible for a medical subsidy if they retire in accordance with
the terms of the applicable plans and are continuously insured under the Company's group plans or other approved plans in accordance with the plan's participation requirements. The Company shares the
cost of retiree medical benefits with non Medicare-eligible retirees based on years of service, with the Company's share being subject to a 5% limit on future annual medical cost inflation after
retirement. For Medicare-eligible retirees, the Company provides a fixed Company contribution based on years of service and other factors, which is not subject to adjustments for inflation.   

         The
Company has reserved the right to modify or terminate its benefit plans at any time and for any reason.   

Obligations and funded status     

         The Company calculates benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation
("PBO") for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") for other postretirement plans. The determination of pension costs and other postretirement obligations are
determined using a December 31 measurement date. The benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered as of the measurement
date. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formulas and assumptions as to future compensation levels. A plan's funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and
the fair value of plan assets. The Company's funding policy for the pension plans is to make annual contributions at a level that is in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code
("IRC") and generally accepted actuarial principles. The Company's postretirement benefit plans are not funded.   

  179  

Table of Contents   

         The
components of the plans' funded status that are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31 are as follows:   

The
$913 million increase in the pension net actuarial loss during 2014 is primarily related to a decrease in the discount rate and the adoption of new Society of Actuaries
mortality assumptions. The majority of the $2.71 billion
net actuarial pension benefit losses not yet recognized in 2014 reflects decreases in the discount rate and the effect of unfavorable equity market conditions on the value of the pension plan assets
in prior years. The $125 million decrease in the OPEB net actuarial gain during 2014 primarily reflects a decrease in the discount rate.   

The
underfunding of the primary qualified employee plan represents 79% of the pension benefits' underfunded status as of December 31, 2014.   

         The
change in 2014 in items not yet recognized as a component of net periodic cost, which is recorded in unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost, is shown in the table
below.   

The
net actuarial loss (gain) is recognized as a component of net periodic cost amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits.
Estimates of the net actuarial loss (gain) and prior service credit expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost during 2015 are shown in the table below.

The
accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") for all defined benefit pension plans was $6.42 billion and $5.23 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The ABO is the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the   

  180  

Table of Contents   

  pension
benefit formula to employee service rendered at the measurement date. However, it differs from the PBO due to the exclusion of an assumption as to future compensation levels.   

         The
PBO, ABO and fair value of plan assets for the Company's pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets were $6.12 billion, $6.06 billion and $5.38 billion,
respectively, as of December 31, 2014 and $146 million, $145 million and zero, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. Included in the accrued benefit cost of the pension
benefits are certain unfunded non-qualified plans with accrued benefit costs of $147 million and $146 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.   

         The
changes in benefit obligations for all plans for the years ended December 31 are as follows:   

(1)     Benefits
paid include lump sum distributions, a portion of which may trigger settlement accounting treatment.    

Components of net periodic cost     

         The components of net periodic cost for all plans for the years ended December 31 are as follows:   

Assumptions     

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost for the years ended
December 31 are:   

181  

Table of Contents   

         Weighted
average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31 are listed in the following table.   

The
weighted average health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit cost is 6.8% for 2015, gradually declining to 4.5% in 2024 and remaining at that
level thereafter.   

         Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care plans. A one percentage-point increase in assumed health care
cost trend rates would increase the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits and the APBO by $2 million and
$25 million, respectively. A one percentage-point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit
cost of other postretirement benefits and the APBO by $2 million and $24 million, respectively.   

Pension plan assets     

         The change in pension plan assets for the years ended December 31 is as follows:   

In
general, the Company's pension plan assets are managed in accordance with investment policies approved by pension investment committees. The purpose of the policies is to ensure the
plans' long-term ability to meet benefit obligations by prudently investing plan assets and Company contributions, while taking into consideration regulatory and legal requirements and current market
conditions. The investment policies are reviewed periodically and specify target plan asset allocation by asset category. In addition, the policies specify various asset allocation and other risk
limits. The target asset allocation takes the plans' funding status into consideration, among other factors, including anticipated demographic changes or liquidity requirements that may affect the
funding status such as the potential impact of lump sum settlements as well as existing or expected market conditions. In general, the allocation has a lower overall investment risk when a plan is in
a stronger funded status position since there is less economic incentive to take risk to increase the expected returns on the plan assets. As a result, the primary employee plan has a greater
allocation to equity securities than the employee-agent plan. The primary qualified employee plan comprises 79% of total plan assets and 81% of equity securities. The pension plans' asset exposure
within each asset category is tracked against widely accepted established benchmarks for each asset class with limits on variation from the benchmark established in the investment policy. Pension plan
assets are regularly monitored for compliance with these limits and other risk limits specified in the investment policies.   

  182  

Table of Contents   

         The
pension plans' weighted average target asset allocation and the actual percentage of plan assets, by asset category as of December 31, 2014 are as follows:   

(1)     The
target asset allocation considers risk based exposure while the actual percentage of plan assets utilizes a financial reporting view
excluding exposure provided through derivatives.       (2)     Securities
lending collateral reinvestment is excluded from the table above.    

The
target asset allocation for an asset category may be achieved either through direct investment holdings, through replication using derivative instruments (e.g., futures or
swaps) or net of hedges using derivative instruments to reduce exposure to an asset category. The net notional amount of derivatives used for replication and hedges is limited to 105% or 115% of total
plan assets depending on the plan. Market performance of the different asset categories may, from time to time, cause deviation from the target asset allocation. The asset allocation mix is reviewed
on a periodic basis and rebalanced to bring the allocation within the target ranges.   

         Outside
the target asset allocation, the pension plans participate in a securities lending program to enhance returns. As of December 31, 2014, U.S. government fixed income
securities and U.S. equity securities are lent out and cash collateral is invested 6% in fixed income securities and 94% in short-term investments.   

The
following table presents the fair values of pension plan assets as of December 31, 2014.   

(1)     Real
estate funds held by the pension plans are primarily invested in U.S. commercial real estate.    

183  

Table of Contents   

(2)     Private
equity funds held by the pension plans are primarily comprised of North American buyout funds.       (3)     The
securities lending obligation represents the plan's obligation to return securities lending collateral received under a securities lending
program. The terms of the program allow both the plan and the counterparty the right and ability to redeem/return the securities loaned on short notice. Due to its relatively short-term nature, the
outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair value.       (4)     Other
net plan assets represent interest and dividends receivable and net receivables related to settlements of investment transactions, such
as purchases and sales.    

The
following table presents the fair values of pension plan assets as of December 31, 2013.   

The
fair values of pension plan assets are estimated using the same methodologies and inputs as those used to determine the fair values for the respective asset category of the Company.
These methodologies and inputs are disclosed in Note 6.

The
following table presents the rollforward of Level 3 plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2012.   

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. The Company's assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets is reviewed annually giving consideration to appropriate financial data including, but not limited to, the plan asset allocation, forward-looking expected returns for the period over which
benefits will be paid, historical returns on plan assets and other relevant market data. Given the long-term forward looking nature of this assumption, the actual returns in any one year do not
immediately result in a change. In giving consideration to the targeted plan asset allocation, the Company evaluated returns using the same sources it has used historically which include: historical
average asset class returns from an independent nationally recognized vendor of this type of data blended together using the asset allocation policy weights for the Company's pension plans; asset
class return forecasts from a large global independent asset management firm that specializes in providing multi-asset class investment fund products which were blended together using the asset
allocation policy weights; and expected portfolio returns from a proprietary simulation methodology of a widely recognized external investment consulting firm that performs asset allocation and
actuarial services for corporate pension plan sponsors. This same methodology has been applied on a consistent basis each year. All of these were consistent with the Company's weighted average
long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.36% used for 2014 and 7.33% that will be used for 2015. The assumption for the primary qualified employee plan is 7.75% and the employee-agent
plan is 5.75% for both years. The employee-agent plan assumption is lower than the primary qualified employee plan assumption due to a lower investment allocation to equity securities and a higher
allocation to fixed income securities. As of the 2014 measurement date, the arithmetic average of the annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent 10 and 5 years was 8.0% and 10.3%,
respectively.   

         Pension
plan assets did not include any of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2014 or 2013.   

Cash flows     

         There was no required cash contribution necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirement under the IRC for the tax qualified
pension plans as of December 31, 2014. The Company currently plans to contribute $127 million to its pension plans in 2015.   

  185

         The
Company contributed $38 million and $39 million to the postretirement benefit plans in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Contributions by participants were
$19 million and $18 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.   

Estimated future benefit payments     

Estimated future benefit payments expected to be paid in the next 10 years, based on the assumptions used to measure the
Company's benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014, are presented in the table below.   

Allstate 401(k) Savings Plan     

         Employees of the Company, with the exception of those employed by the Company's international, Esurance and Answer Financial
subsidiaries, are eligible to become members of the Allstate 401(k) Savings Plan ("Allstate Plan"). The Company's contributions are based on the Company's matching obligation and certain performance
measures. The Company is responsible for funding its anticipated contribution to the Allstate Plan, and may, at the discretion of management, use the ESOP to pre-fund certain portions. In connection
with the Allstate Plan, the Company has a note from the ESOP with a principal balance of $15 million as of December 31, 2014. The ESOP note has a fixed interest rate of 7.9% and matures
in 2019. The Company records dividends on the ESOP shares in retained income and all the shares held by the ESOP are included in basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.   

         The
Company's contribution to the Allstate Plan was $75 million, $54 million and $52 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts were reduced by the
ESOP benefit computed for the years ended December 31 as follows:   

The
Company made $3 million and $2 million in contributions to the ESOP in 2014 and 2013. The Company made no contributions to the ESOP in 2012. As of December 31,
2014, total committed to be released, allocated and unallocated ESOP shares were 1 million, 35 million and 3 million, respectively.   

Allstate's
Canadian, Esurance and Answer Financial subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans for their eligible employees. Expense for these plans was $11 million,
$11 million and $7 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

   18.  Equity Incentive Plans     

         The Company currently has equity incentive plans under which the Company grants nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock awards to
certain employees and directors of the Company. The total compensation expense related to equity awards was $88 million, $93 million and $86 million and the total income tax
benefits were $30 million, $32 million and $30 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total cash received from the exercise of options was $314 million,
$212 million and $99 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total tax benefit realized on options exercised and stock unrestricted was $73 million, $65 million and
$28 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

         The
Company records compensation expense related to awards under these plans over the shorter of the period in which the requisite service is rendered or retirement eligibility is
attained. Compensation expense for performance share   

  186  

Table of Contents   

  awards
is based on the probable number of awards expected to vest using the performance level most likely to be achieved at the end of the performance period. As of December 31, 2014, total
unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested awards was $74 million, of which $29 million related to nonqualified stock options which are expected to be recognized over the
weighted average vesting period of 1.78 years, $34 million related to restricted stock units which are expected to be recognized over the weighted average vesting period of
1.81 years and $11 million related to performance stock awards which are expected to be recognized over the weighted average vesting period of 1.38 years.   

         Options
are granted to employees with exercise prices equal to the closing share price of the Company's common stock on the applicable grant date. Options granted to employees on or
after February 18, 2014 vest ratably over a three-year period. Options granted from February 22, 2010 through February 17, 2014 vest 50% on the second anniversary of the grant
date and 25% on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who are retirement eligible and in certain other limited
circumstances. Options may be exercised once vested and will expire no later than ten years after the date of grant.   

Restricted
stock units granted on or after February 18, 2014 vest and unrestrict in full on the third anniversary of the grant date, except for directors whose awards vest
immediately and unrestrict after leaving the board. Restricted stock units granted to employees from February 22, 2010 through February 17, 2014 vest and unrestrict 50% on the second
anniversary of the grant date and 25% on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who are retirement eligible and in
certain other limited circumstances.   

         Performance
stock awards vest and are converted into shares of stock on the third anniversary of the grant date. Vesting of the number of performance stock awards earned based on the
attainment of performance goals for each of the performance periods is subject to continued service, except for employees who are retirement eligible and in certain other limited circumstances, and
achievement of performance goals.   

         A
total of 97.6 million shares of common stock were authorized to be used for awards under the plans, subject to adjustment in accordance with the plans' terms. As of
December 31, 2014, 29.7 million shares were reserved and remained available for future issuance under these plans. The Company uses its treasury shares for these issuances.   

         The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
termination within the valuation model. In addition, separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of
options granted is derived from the output of the binominal lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility of the price of
the underlying shares is implied based on traded options and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The expected dividends were based on the current dividend yield of the Company's stock
as of the date of the grant. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The assumptions used are
shown in the following table.   

187  

Table of Contents   

         A
summary of option activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is shown in the following table.   

The
weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was $12.50, $11.99 and $8.69 during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The intrinsic value, which is the difference between
the fair value and the exercise price, of options exercised was $151 million, $92 million and $52 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

The
changes in restricted stock units are shown in the following table for the year ended December 31, 2014.   

The
fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company's stock as of the date of the grant. The market value in part reflects the payment of future
dividends expected. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted was $52.70, $45.78 and $31.89 during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The total fair value of
restricted stock units vested was $60 million, $104 million and $30 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.   

         The
changes in performance stock awards are shown in the following table for the year ended December 31, 2014.   

The
increase in PSA's comprises the granted which is at the targeted payout and the adjustment to the granted for performance achievement. The fair value of performance stock awards is
based on the market value of the Company's stock as of the date of the grant. The market value in part reflects the payment of future dividends expected. The weighted average grant date fair value of
performance stock awards granted was $52.18, $45.61
and $31.41 during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. None of the performance stock awards vested during 2014, 2013 or 2012.

         The
tax benefit realized in 2014, 2013 and 2012 related to tax deductions from stock option exercises and included in shareholders' equity was $23 million, $12 million and
$8 million, respectively. The tax benefit realized in 2014, 2013 and 2012 related to all stock-based compensation and recorded directly to shareholders' equity was $32 million,
$30 million and $6 million, respectively.   

   19.  Reporting Segments     

         Allstate management is organized around products and services, and this structure is considered in the identification of its four reportable segments. These
segments and their respective operations are as follows:   

            Allstate Protection    principally sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in the United States and Canada. Revenues from
external customers generated outside the United States were $1.08 billion, $1.06 billion and $992 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company evaluates the results
of this segment based upon underwriting results.   

            Discontinued Lines and Coverages    consists of property-liability business no longer written by Allstate, including results from asbestos,
environmental and other discontinued lines claims, and certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. This segment also includes the historical results of the commercial and reinsurance
businesses sold in 1996. The Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon underwriting results.   

Allstate Financial    sells traditional, interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance products.
Allstate Financial previously offered and continues to have in force fixed annuities such as deferred and immediate annuities, and institutional products consisting of funding agreements sold to
unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes. Allstate Financial had no revenues from external customers generated outside the United States in 2014, 2013 or 2012. The Company evaluates
the results of this segment based upon operating income.   

            Corporate and Other    comprises holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations.   

Allstate
Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages comprise Property-Liability. The Company does not allocate Property-Liability investment income, realized capital gains and
losses, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability, Allstate
Financial, and Corporate and Other levels for decision-making purposes. Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial performance and resources are managed by committees of senior officers of the
respective segments.   

         The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. The effects of certain inter-segment transactions are excluded from segment
performance evaluation and therefore are eliminated in the segment results.   

Measuring segment profit or loss     

         The measure of segment profit or loss used by Allstate's management in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate
Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments and operating income for the Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other segments. A reconciliation of these measures to net income is provided
below.   

Underwriting income    is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expenses ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and
expenses, and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.   

            Operating income    is net income available to common shareholders, excluding:  

realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which
are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,   
            valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, after-tax,   
            amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses or
valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, after-tax,   
            amortization of purchased intangible assets, after-tax,   
            gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and    
  189  

Table of Contents    

adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such
that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.    

Summarized
revenue data for each of the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December 31 are as follows:   

(1)     For
presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, service fees of the Corporate and Other segment are reclassified to operating
costs and expenses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     

  To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
The Allstate Corporation 
Northbrook, Illinois 60062   

  We
have audited the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related
Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in    Internal Control   Integrated Framework
(2013)    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying     Item 9A. Controls and Procedures   . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.   

  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   

  A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

  Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   

  In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in    Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)    issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

           Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities
Exchange Act and made known to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

           Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.       Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.   

         Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in "Internal
Control   Integrated Framework (2013)" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.   

         Deloitte  
Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued
their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.   

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.       During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014, there have been no changes in
our
internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   SCHEDULE II (CONTINUED)      CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT   NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION            

   1.     General     

         The financial statements of the Registrant should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8.
The long-term debt presented in Note 12 "Capital Structure" are direct obligations of the Registrant, with the exception of the $44 million of synthetic lease obligations as of
December 31, 2013. A majority of the pension and other postretirement benefits plans presented in Note 17 "Benefit Plans" are direct obligations of the Registrant.   

Participating
subsidiaries fund the pension plans contributions under a master services cost sharing agreement. In addition, as a result of joint and several pension liability rules
under the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, many liabilities that arise in connection with pension plans are joint and several across all
members of a controlled group of entities.   

   2.    Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information     

         The Registrant paid $332 million, $359 million and $364 million of interest on debt in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM            

  To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
The Allstate Corporation 
Northbrook, Illinois 60062   

  We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2014, and the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, and have issued our report thereon dated February 19, 2015;
such consolidated financial statements and report are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedules of the
Company listed in the accompanying index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
