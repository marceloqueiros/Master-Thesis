  Research and Innovation    
  We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas. Research and innovation, which are components of our overall investment in our business, have been major factors in our success, and we believe they will help us continue to grow in the future. We use our investment in research and development on which we spent $791 million, $704 million and $643 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively to help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions. We spend a significant portion of our research and development investment to develop market-ready solutions for our clients.    
  We view innovation as a source of competitive advantage. We seek to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value. Our innovation architecture brings together our innovation capabilities across the Company from research, ventures and labs to our studios, innovation centers and delivery centers. This includes research and thought leadership to identify market, technology and industry trends. Through Accenture Ventures, we partner with and invest in growth-stage companies that create innovative enterprise technologies.

Organizational Structure and History    
  Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture plc.  
  Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Class I common shares of Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares and direct subsidiary of Accenture Ltd ( Accenture SCA ), or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares.    
  On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland. This transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009.    
  On April 10, 2015, Accenture Holdings plc, then Accenture plc s subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to further consolidate Accenture s presence in Ireland. On August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA merged with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity. This merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on our Consolidated   Financial Statements.  On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.    
  All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc). The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc (for applicable periods) and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests.  Accenture Leadership  is comprised of members of our global management committee (our primary management and leadership team, which consists of approximately 20 of our most senior leaders), senior managing directors and managing directors. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was less than 1% as of August 31, 2018.    
  Accenture plc Class A and Class X Ordinary Shares    
  Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under   Organizational Structure and History,  Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares.    
  Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.

A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer.    
  Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares    
  Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS   
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.  
  Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients  businesses and levels of business activity.  
  Global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect our clients  businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services and solutions. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of the United Kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the European Union, the potential for changes in global trade policies and trends such as populism and economic nationalism, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.  
  Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.  
  Our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services and solutions with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions. Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technologies have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such delays can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall.  
  Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected.  
  We operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation. At any given time in a particular operating group, business, industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our consolidated revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant operating group, business, industry and/or geography.  
  Many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days  notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client s strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.  
  If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.  
  Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and constantly innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services and solutions clients are demanding, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is intense competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our competitors have directly targeted our employees with these highly sought-after skills and may continue to do so. As a result, we may be unable to cost-effectively hire and retain employees with these market-leading skills, which may cause us to incur increased costs. As technology evolves and we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with unique and highly specialized skills.  
  We are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees may be limited, and competition for these resources is intense. Our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, develop, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities.  
  Similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our profitability could suffer. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer. The costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant. An important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed. Therefore, if we are not  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs.  
  Our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected.  
  There is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if demand for our services and solutions were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs. At certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  
  We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks.  
  We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people, clients, alliance partners and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. Such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of or damage to our systems and those of our clients, alliance partners and vendors, and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our and our service providers  systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.  
  In providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of artificial intelligence, the internet of things and analytics. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, misappropriation, or other intentional or unintentional acts, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and could result in significant financial exposure. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our or our service providers  information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who continuously develop and deploy viruses, ransomware or other malicious software programs or social engineering attacks, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and maintaining effective security measures and protocols.  
  We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which became effective in May 2018, various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. The GDPR imposes new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance. For example, failure to comply with the GDPR may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, orders to discontinue certain data processing operations, private lawsuits, or reputational damage. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.  
  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.  
  The markets in which we offer our services and solutions are highly competitive. Our competitors include:  
             
    large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do;  
                
    off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, that offer services globally that are similar to the services and solutions we offer;  
                
    accounting firms that provide consulting and other services and solutions in areas that compete with us;  
                
    solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including digital and advertising agencies and emerging start-ups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and  
                
    in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.  
     Some competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals, may be able to innovate and provide new services and solutions faster than we can or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do.  
  Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. Some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging. Additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  
  In addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers or acquisitions. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. Over time, our access to certain technology products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation. Additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients. If buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations.  
  Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  
  We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.  
  In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the expiration of current tax benefits and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic conditions  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

and tax policies. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. 
  A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Act ), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act s  base erosion and anti-abuse tax  provisions, or regulations issued thereunder, could adversely impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses.  
  The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ), which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. The changes recommended by the OECD have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. In addition, the European Commission has expanded upon the OECD guidelines with anti-tax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states. Among other things, the directives require companies to provide increased country-by-country disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities, which in turn could lead to disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them. The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
  Although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or these other jurisdictions.  
  Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies.  
  Our profitability is highly dependent on a variety of factors and could be materially impacted by any of the following:  
  Our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectations.   If we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including:  
             
    general economic and political conditions;  
                
    our clients  desire to reduce their costs;  
                
    the competitive environment in our industry;  
                
    our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery costs, upon which our pricing is sometimes determined, includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery costs over long-term contracts; and  
                
    the procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors.  
     Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive.   The competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to secure new contracts at our target economics in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. The less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and overall economics. In addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the services or solutions we offer. Competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share.

Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability.   Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to     cost-effectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.  
  If we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable.   Our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.  
  Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  
  Although we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had an adverse effect, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our results of operations.  
  Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies. These changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in U.S. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. Our currency hedging programs, which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful. Additionally, some transactions and balances may be denominated in currencies for which there is no available market to hedge.  
  As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. Our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful. This could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources. Conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies, such as the Indian rupee or Philippine peso, against the currencies in which our revenue is recorded could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost. In addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. These include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts, risks related to ineffective hedges and risks related to currency fluctuations. We also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

exposures that we are hedging. Such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure.  
  As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks. 
  We have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 52 countries around the world. One aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world. Our growth strategy might not be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including the concentration of our global delivery capability in India and the Philippines, international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters and security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients  control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets. Negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us. 
  Our global delivery capability is concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks. Our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability, which includes Accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world. While these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery capability in India, where we have the largest number of people located in our delivery centers, and the Philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located. Concentrating our global delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks, including those listed in the following paragraph, many of which are beyond our control. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other Accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace. 
  International hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations.   Acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, sea level rise, floods, droughts and the increasing frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us. These events could adversely affect our clients  levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners, suppliers or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and solutions to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as physical infrastructure damage to, system failures at, cyberattacks on, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients. We might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  
  We could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies.   In some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations and expose us to more extreme currency fluctuations. This risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets.  
  Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.   We are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data privacy and protection, government compliance, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations. The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, enforcement actions or criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees,  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines, enforcement actions and/or criminal prosecution or sanctions, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights.  
  In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010. Our employees, subcontractors, vendors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.  
  Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us. In addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients. 
  Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. 
  We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management s attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.  
  For example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. We may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. In addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. We may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. If we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients  businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas, including risks related to data security. A failure of a client s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  
  While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.  
  Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. 
  Our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:  
             
    Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.  
                
    If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.  
                
    U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of  credible evidence  of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.  
                
    Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.  
                
    Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.  
                
    Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.  
                
    Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that  
     
   17 

     Table of Contents  

we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed.  
             
    Our ability to work for the U.S. government is impacted by the fact that we are an Irish company. We elected to enter into a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense that enhances the ability of our U.S. federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the U.S. government. The proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of, and limits the control we can exercise over, this subsidiary. In addition, legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could place additional limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S. company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.  
     The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.  
  If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. 
  As of August 31, 2018, we had approximately 459,000 employees worldwide. Our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. It might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge. It might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations. The size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. For example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients  sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information. Furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. In addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.  
  If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  We have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. A very significant portion of our revenue and services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners. See  Business Alliances.   
  The business that we conduct through these alliances could decrease or fail to grow for a variety of reasons. The priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours, and our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors. In addition, some of our alliance partners are also large clients or suppliers of technology to Accenture. The decisions we make vis- -vis an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship. In addition, our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which could lessen related demand for our services and solutions. 
  We must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology. We must secure meaningful alliances with these providers early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skills in new technologies. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with current partners and identify new and emerging providers of relevant technology to expand our network of alliance partners, we may not be able to differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market.

     Table of Contents  

If we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.  
  Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. 
  We believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, cybersecurity breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers. There is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. 
  We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. 
  We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance or add to our skills and capabilities or offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of capital invested in such opportunities. We may not succeed in completing targeted transactions, including as a result of the market becoming increasingly competitive, or achieve desired results of operations. 
  Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture. Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management s attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. The potential loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions. 
  We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company s known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties. In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target s previous activities, internal controls and security environment. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100%. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.

We periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.  
  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary methodologies, processes, software and other solutions. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our services or solutions, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Even where we obtain intellectual property protection, our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors, former employees, or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to or duplicative of ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights.  
  In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Additionally, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we are unable to implement in a cost-effective manner alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients.       Any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.  
  Further, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions. Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results.  
  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. We base our estimates on  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.  
  Many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms. Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients  actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate. These provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts.  
  Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.  
  The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.  
  We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders  ownership interest in us.  
  We might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  
             
    take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion;  
                
    acquire other businesses or assets;  
                
    repurchase shares from our shareholders;  
                
    develop new services and solutions; or  
                
    respond to competitive pressures.  
     Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders  ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.  
  We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.  
  We are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. A shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland or in countries other than the United States where we have assets. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.  
  Although the United States and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, the Irish Courts will recognize a U.S. judgment if the following important requirements are satisfied: 
     the originating court is a court of competent jurisdiction; 
     the judgment is final and conclusive; and  
     the judgment was not obtained by fraud and its recognition is not contrary to Irish public policy.  
  Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland. Similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets. 
  Some companies that conduct substantial business in the United States but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding U.S. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over U.S. companies. Accenture never conducted business under a U.S. parent company and pays U.S. taxes on all of its U.S. operations. Nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in Ireland.  
  Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.  
  Our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act. The Companies Act differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.  
  Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.  
  Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company s authorized but unissued share capital. In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS    
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    
  We use the terms  Accenture,   we,  the  Company,   our  and  us  in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to  fiscal   2018    means the 12-month period that ended on   August 31, 2018  . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.    
  We use the term  in local currency  so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results  in local currency  are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.    
   
  Overview    
  Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients  current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.    
  Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.    
  Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues )   for   fiscal 2018   increased   13.5%   in U.S. dollars and   10.5%   in local currency compared to   fiscal 2017  . Demand for our services and solutions continued to be very strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During   fiscal 2018  , revenue growth in local currency was very strong in  Communication, Media   Technology, Resources and Products and strong in Financial Services and Health   Public Service. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and strong growth in North America and Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during   fiscal 2018  . While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable. We use the term  pricing  to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. 
  In our consulting business,   net revenues for   fiscal 2018   increased   15%   in U.S. dollars and   12%   in local currency compared to   fiscal 2017  . Consulting revenue growth in local currency in   fiscal 2018   was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media   Technology, Resources, Financial Services and Products as well as strong growth in Health   Public Service  . Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. 
  In our outsourcing business, net revenues for   fiscal 2018   increased   12%   in U.S. dollars and   9%   in local currency compared to   fiscal 2017  . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in   fiscal 2018   was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media   Technology, Resources and Products, as well as strong growth in Health   Public Service  and modest growth in Financial Services  . We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. 
  As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.   The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during   fiscal 2018  , resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was

approximately   3%   higher than our revenue growth in local currency for the year.   Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our full fiscal   2019   revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately   2.5%   lower than our revenue growth in local currency.    
  The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.    
  Utilization for   fiscal 2018   was   91%  , flat with   fiscal 2017  . We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.   We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately   459,000   as of   August 31, 2018  , compared to approximately   425,000   as of   August 31, 2017  . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for   fiscal 2018   was   15%  , up from   14%   in   fiscal 2017  . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases   become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.  
  Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for   fiscal 2018   was   31.4%  , compared with   31.7%   for   fiscal 2017  . The decrease in gross margin for   fiscal 2018   was principally due to higher labor costs compared to   fiscal 2017  , partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018. 
  Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were   16.7%   for   fiscal 2018  , compared with   16.9%   for   fiscal 2017  . We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For   fiscal 2018   compared to   fiscal 2017  , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased   20   basis points and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat. 
  During   fiscal 2017  , we recorded a   $510 million   pension settlement charge and related   $198 million     reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination. For additional information, see Note   10   (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for     fiscal 2018   was   14.8%  , compared with   13.3%   for   fiscal 2017  . The pension settlement charge   decreased operating margin by   150   basis points for   fiscal 2017  . Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for   fiscal 2017   would have been flat with fiscal 2018   at   14.8%  .    
  The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2018   was   27.4%  , compared with   21.3%   for   fiscal 2017  . During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Act ) of   $178 million  . Absent this charge and   $81 million   of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been   23.0%  . Absent the   pension settlement charge and related   taxes   described above, our effective tax rate for   fiscal 2017   would have also been   23.0%  .   For additional information, see Note   9   (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  Diluted earnings per share were   $6.34   for   fiscal 2018  , compared with   $5.44   for   fiscal 2017  . The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by   $0.40   in   fiscal 2018  . The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes,   decreased diluted earnings per share by   $0.47   in   fiscal 2017  . Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been   $6.74   and   $5.91   for   fiscal 2018   and   2017  , respectively.    
  We have presented effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in   fiscal 2018   and the pension settlement charge in   fiscal 2017   as well as operating income and operating margin

excluding the impact of the pension settlement charge in   fiscal 2017  , as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our financial performance when comparing these periods.    
  Our operating income   and diluted earnings per share are   affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note   7   (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
     As described further in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), on March 13, 2018 our subsidiary Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. The merger was internal and administrative in nature. 
  Beginning in fiscal 2019, we are adopting new accounting standards that will affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs: Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09:  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606); and ASU No. 2017-07:  Compensation Retirement Benefits  (Topic 715). In connection with the adoption, we will present total revenues and will no longer report revenues before reimbursements. Also, certain components of pension costs will be reclassified from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. In our subsequent periodic reports, prior-period results will be revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. Additionally, on September 1, 2018, we will adopt ASU No. 2016-16:  Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which will require us to record deferred tax assets of up to $2.1 billion and incremental income tax expense going forward, as these deferred tax assets are utilized. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
   
  Bookings and Backlog 
  New bookings for   fiscal 2018   were   $42.81 billion  , with consulting bookings of   $23.63 billion   and outsourcing bookings of   $19.18 billion  .    
  We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.    
  The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.    
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.

     Table of Contents  

Revenue Recognition    
  Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.    
  We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.    
  Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.    
  Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.    
  Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.

We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price we charge when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.    
  Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.    
  Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.    
  Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. 
  Income Taxes    
  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Act ), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses.    
  Due to the recent enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we had previously recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements. In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded an adjustment of $40,927 to our provisional tax expense resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act. While we now consider our analysis of these items under the Tax Act to be complete, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance. The election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the election is made.    
  Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.

     Table of Contents  

We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.    
  No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
  As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions. 
   
  Revenues by Segment/Operating Group    
  Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media   Technology; Financial Services; Health   Public Service; Products; and Resources. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.    
  From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.    
  While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

    Growth Markets net revenues increased   16%   in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Brazil, and Singapore. 
     Operating Expenses    
  Operating expenses for   fiscal 2018   increased   $3,630 million  , or   11%  , over   fiscal 2017  , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to   86.0%   from   87.4%   during this period  . Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for     fiscal 2018   increased   $3,515 million  , or   12%  , over   fiscal 2017  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   85.2%   from   86.7%   during this period. 
  Cost of Services    
  Cost of services for   fiscal 2018   increased   $3,426 million  , or   13%  , over   fiscal 2017  , and increased as a percentage of revenues to   70.1%   from   70.0%   during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for   fiscal 2018     increased   $3,311 million  , or   14%  , over   fiscal 2017  , and increased as a percentage of net revenues to   68.6%   from   68.3%     during this period. Gross margin for   fiscal 2018   decreased to   31.4%   from   31.7%   in   fiscal 2017  . The decrease in gross margin for   fiscal 2018   was principally due to higher labor costs compared to fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018.    
  Sales and Marketing    
  Sales and marketing expense for   fiscal 2018   increased   $444 million  , or   12%  , over   fiscal 2017  , and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to   10.6%   from   10.8%   during this period. 
  General and Administrative Costs    
  General and administrative costs for   fiscal 2018   increased   $270 million  , or   13%  , over   fiscal 2017  , and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at   6.1%   during this period.

Operating Income and Operating Margin    
  Operating income for   fiscal 2018   increased   $1,208 million  , or   26%  , over   fiscal 2017  . The pension settlement charge   decreased operating margin in   fiscal 2017   by   150   basis points. Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for   fiscal 2018   was   14.8%  , flat with   fiscal 2017  .    
     Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows:

     We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during   fiscal 2018   was similar to that disclosed for net revenue.   The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for   fiscal 2018   compared with   fiscal 2017  :    
             
    Communications, Media   Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. 
                
    Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth. 
                
    Health   Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower consulting contract profitability. 
                
    Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability. 
                
    Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. 
     Other Income (Expense), net    
  Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During   fiscal 2018  , other expense increased   $31 million   over   fiscal 2017  , primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. 
  Provision for Income Taxes    
  The effective tax rate for   fiscal 2018   was   27.4%  , compared with   21.3%   for   fiscal 2017  . In   fiscal 2018  , we recorded a   $258 million   charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for   fiscal 2018   would have been   23.0%  . Absent the   pension settlement charge of   $510 million   and related tax impact of   $198 million  , the effective tax rate for   fiscal 2017   would have been   23.0%  .   For additional information, see Note   9   (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  In addition, as described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16.    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries.

Structure.  Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc.    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for   fiscal 2018   decreased   $35 million  , or   18%  , from   fiscal 2017  , primarily due to the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, which decreased the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   .    
  Earnings Per Share    
  Diluted earnings per share were   $6.34   for   fiscal 2018  , compared with   $5.44   for   fiscal 2017  . The   $0.90   increase in our diluted earnings per share included   the impact of the tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for   fiscal 2018   by   $0.40  . The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share for   fiscal 2017   by   $0.47  . Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been   $6.74   and   $5.91   for   fiscal 2018   and   2017  , respectively, an   increase of   $0.83  .   This increase was due to increases of   $0.82   from higher revenues and operating results and   $0.05   from lower weighted average shares outstanding  ,   partially offset by decreases of   $0.02   from lower non-operating income and   $0.02   from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interest.   For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Results of Operations for Fiscal   2017   Compared to Fiscal   2016    
  Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows:    

_______________  
  n/m = not meaningful    
  Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.    
           (1)  
    Effective September 1, 2017, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada), Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.    
     Net Revenues    
     The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for   fiscal 2017   compared to   fiscal 2016  :    
  Operating Groups    
             
    Communications, Media   Technology net revenues increased 4% in local currency, led by Software   Platforms in North America, as well as growth across all industry groups in Growth Markets. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Communications   Media in Europe, as disruptions in the market continue to impact demand.    
                
    Financial Services net revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by Banking   Capital Markets in Europe and Growth Markets.    
                
    Health   Public Service net revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by Public Service in Growth Markets and Europe.    
                
    Products net revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by very strong growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail   Travel Services, as well as Life Sciences in North America and Industrial in Europe.

     Table of Contents  

Resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency, led by Utilities in Europe, partially offset by declines in Energy across all geographic regions.     
     Geographic Regions    
             
    North America net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by the United States.    
                
    Europe net revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as France, Spain and Switzerland.     
                
    Growth Markets net revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Singapore and China.    
     Operating Expenses    
  Operating expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,146 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 86.2% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,145 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.7% from 85.4% during this period.    
  Cost of Services    
  Cost of services for fiscal 2017 increased $1,215 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.0% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $1,214 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 68.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2017 increased to 31.7% from 31.3% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017 was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues, compared to fiscal 2016.    
  Sales and Marketing    
  Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 increased $174 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.8% from 10.9% during this period. 
  General and Administrative Costs    
  General and administrative costs for fiscal 2017 increased $247 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.1% from 5.7% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to higher technology and facilities costs, as well as higher acquisition-related costs. 
  Pension Settlement Charge    
  We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Operating Income and Operating Margin    
  Operating income for fiscal 2017 decreased $178 million, or 4%, from fiscal 2016. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points. Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 increased 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2016.

     We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2017 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2017, each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    
             
    Communications, Media   Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.     
                
    Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.     
                
    Health   Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower outsourcing contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenues.    
                
    Products operating income increased principally due to very strong revenue growth, as well as higher consulting contract profitability.    
                
    Resources operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenue.     
     Other Income (Expense), net    
  Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During fiscal 2017, other expense decreased $31 million from fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses.    
  Gain (Loss) on Sale of Businesses    
  We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of $548 million and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture of $301 million during fiscal 2016.

Provision for Income Taxes    
  The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 21.3%, compared with 22.4% for fiscal 2016. Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0%. Absent the gain on sale of businesses of $849 million and related tax impact of $104 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes, other adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, and the recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. This was partially offset by a net increase to prior-year non-U.S. tax liabilities, primarily related to a final assessment of prior-year taxes in Switzerland. The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate also benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes.    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., and prior to March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc. See  Business Organizational Structure and History.  Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2016. The decrease was due to lower net income of $715 million, primarily driven by the pension settlement charge recorded during fiscal 2017 as well as the gain on sale of businesses recorded during fiscal 2016.    
  Earnings Per Share    
  Diluted earnings per share were $5.44 for fiscal 2017, compared with $6.45 for fiscal 2016. The $1.01 decrease in our diluted earnings per share included both the impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47 and the impact of the gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $5.91 and $5.34 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.57 due to increases of $0.38 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.06 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.04 from lower non-operating expense. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal   2017  , we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility. In addition, we could raise additional funds through other     public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:    
             
    facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;    
                
    acquire complementary businesses or technologies;    
                
    take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or    
                
    develop new services and solutions.    
     As of   August 31, 2018  , Cash and cash equivalents were   $5.1 billion  , compared with   $4.1 billion   as of   August 31, 2017  .    
  Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:    

Operating activities:     The $1,054 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and lower tax disbursements, as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower spending on certain compensation payments. 
  Investing activities:     Cash used in investing activities decreased   $984 million   due to lower spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by higher spending on property and equipment.   For additional information, see Note   5   (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  Financing activities:     The   $149 million   increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as the purchase of additional interests in consolidated subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note   13   (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders  Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
  Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 
  Borrowing Facilities    
  See Note 8 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   
  Share Purchases and Redemptions    
  We   intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal   2019  . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under   our   open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions,     our ongoing  
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders  Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

  Obligations and Commitments    
  As of   August 31, 2018  , we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments:    

_______________  
  Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.    
           (1) 
    The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, see Note   9   (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
              (2) 
    Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.    
              (3) 
    Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.    
      
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note   15   (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
  All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.    
  Foreign Currency Risk    
  We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.    
  Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges primarily U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Swedish krona are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note   7   (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
  For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of   August 31, 2018  , it was anticipated that approximately   $21 million   of net losses, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.     
  We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately   $483 million   and   $494 million   as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively  . 
  Interest Rate Risk    
  The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of   August 31, 2018   is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.    
  Other Market Risk    
  The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of   August 31, 2018  .    
  Equity Price Risk    
  The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
           i. 
    pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
              ii. 
    provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and 
              iii. 
    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
     Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued its attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. See  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  on page F-2. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  To the Shareholders and Board of Directors  
  Accenture plc: 
    
  Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Accenture plc and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
  Basis for Opinions  
  The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying   Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  
   F- 2 

     Table of Contents  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2002.

1.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
  Description of Business    
  Accenture   plc is one of the world s leading organizations providing consulting, technology and outsourcing services and operates globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable it to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry and functional expertise, technology capabilities and alliances, and global delivery resources, Accenture   plc seeks to provide differentiated services that help clients measurably improve their business performance and create sustainable value for their customers and stakeholders. Accenture   plc s global delivery model enables it to provide high-quality, cost-effective solutions to clients.    
  Basis of Presentation    
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and our controlled subsidiary companies. Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company, which operates its business through its subsidiaries. Prior to March 13, 2018, Accenture plc s only business was to hold ordinary and deferred shares in, and to act as the controlling shareholder of, its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company. We operated our business through Accenture Holdings plc and subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc. Accenture plc controlled Accenture Holdings plc s management and operations and consolidated Accenture Holdings plc s results in our Consolidated Financial Statements.     
  On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.    
  All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc).   The shares of     Accenture Holdings plc (for applicable periods) and   Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other than us are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements.   The noncontrolling interest percentages were less than   1%   and   4%   as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively. 
  All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to  fiscal   2018    means the 12-month period that ended on   August 31, 2018  . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.    
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.    
  Revenue Recognition    
  Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.    
  Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.    
  Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.    
  Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were   $690,868   and   $739,212   as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Deferred transition amortization expense for fiscal   2018  ,   2017   and   2016   was   $333,118  ,   $289,555  , and   $283,434  , respectively. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Deferred transition revenues were   $581,395   and   $606,095   as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively, and are included in non-current Deferred revenues. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.    
  We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by us to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.    
  Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

Revenues before reimbursements ( net revenues ) include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale, as well as revenues from alliance agreements. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resale. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. 
  Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements    
  Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.    
  Income Taxes    
  We calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We establish liabilities or reduce assets when we believe tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Each fiscal quarter, we evaluate tax positions and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances.    
  Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts    
  Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents    
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including certificates of deposit and time deposits. Cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash of   $45,658   and   $45,547   as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively, which primarily relates to cash held to meet certain insurance requirements. As a result of certain subsidiaries  cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances. Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.    
  Client Receivables, Unbilled Services and Allowances    
  We record our client receivables and unbilled services at their face amounts less allowances. On a periodic basis, we evaluate our receivables and unbilled services and establish allowances based on historical experience and other currently available information. As of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were   $49,913   and   $74,450  , respectively. The allowance reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables and unbilled services. In limited circumstances, we agree to extend financing to certain clients. The terms vary by contract, but generally payment for services is contractually linked to the achievement of specified performance milestones.

  Our financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments, client receivables and unbilled services, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.    
  Investments    
  All liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments. Non-current investments are primarily non-marketable equity securities of privately held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or cost methods of accounting, in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in Interest income.    
  Cost method investments are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. For investments in privately held companies, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, the fair value is not estimated. If an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment. 
  Property and Equipment    
  Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:    
                 Computers, related equipment and software 
    2 to 7 years 
      Furniture and fixtures 
    5 to 10 years 
      Leasehold improvements 
    Lesser of lease term or 15 years 

Goodwill    
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of net assets acquired. We review the recoverability of goodwill by reportable operating segment annually, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. Based on the results of our annual impairment analysis, we determined that no impairment existed as of   August 31,   2018   or   2017  , as each reportable operating segment s estimated fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value.    
  Long-Lived Assets    
  Long-lived assets, including deferred contract costs and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future net cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recorded equal to the amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.    
  Intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, ranging from   one   to   fifteen   years.

     New Accounting Pronouncements    
  The following standards, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), will, or are expected to, result in a change in practice and/or have a financial impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements:    
                           Standard 
      
    Description 
      
    Accenture Adoption Date 
      
    Impact on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters 
      2016-16  : Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory 
      
    The guidance requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Under current guidance in U.S. GAAP, in the case of depreciable or amortizable assets, the income tax consequences are deferred at the time of the intra-entity transfer and recognized as the assets are depreciated or amortized. The guidance requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.  
      
    September 1, 2018 
      
    The adoption of this ASU will require that we record deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at the beginning of fiscal 2019. The deferred tax assets, which we expect to be up to $2.1 billion, represent income tax consequences of prior intra-entity transfers of assets, which are currently recognized over the expected life of the assets.  Beginning in fiscal 2019, we will recognize incremental income tax expense as these deferred tax assets are utilized. This could represent approximately a 3.3 percentage point increase in the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2019.  However, the actual impact of adoption will depend on numerous factors, including management s expectations regarding recoverability of the related deferred taxes. Adoption will not have any impact on our cash flows.  
      2014-09  : (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers   and related updates 
      
    The guidance replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The guidance allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. 
      
    September 1, 2018 
      
    We expect revenue recognition across our portfolio of services to remain largely unchanged. However, the guidance will change the timing of revenue recognition in certain areas, including earlier recognition for certain variable fees and consulting services and later recognition for reimbursable expenses on certain contracts, which will be recognized with other revenues rather than when the expenses are incurred. These impacts are not expected to be material.  
    
  We adopted the ASU on September 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The estimated cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings is not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

2016-02  : Leases   and related updates 
      
    The guidance amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The guidance requires either a modified retrospective transition method or a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. 
      
    September 1, 2019 
      
    While we are continuing to assess the potential impact of this ASU, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office space operating leases. We anticipate this ASU will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but will not have a material impact on our other Consolidated Financial Statements or footnotes. We will apply the cumulative effect method.  
      2017-07  :Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost 
      
    The guidance amends certain presentation and disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans. The new standard requires the service cost component of the net benefit cost to be in the same line item as other compensation in operating income and the other components of net benefit cost to be presented outside of operating income on a retrospective basis. 

September 1, 2018 
      
    The adoption of this ASU will require us to reclassify $58 million of operating expenses to non-operating expense for fiscal 2018 to conform with the fiscal 2019 treatment of these expenses.

  5.      BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES    
  Business Combinations  
  Fiscal 2018    
  During   fiscal 2018  , we completed a number of individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of   $596,148  , net of cash acquired. These acquisitions were completed primarily to expand our services and solutions offerings. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded goodwill of   $431,087   and intangible assets of   $140,403  . The intangible assets primarily consist of customer-related and contract-in-progress intangibles, which are being amortized over   one   to   twelve   years. The goodwill was allocated among the reportable operating segments and is partially deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.    
  Fiscal 2017    
  During   fiscal 2017  , we completed a number of individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of   $1,643,205  , net of cash acquired. These acquisitions were completed primarily to expand our services and solutions offerings. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded goodwill of     $1,350,969   and intangible assets of   $328,776  . The intangible assets primarily consist of customer-related and contract-in-progress intangibles, which are being amortized over   one   to   twelve   years. The goodwill was allocated among the reportable operating segments and is partially deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.    
  Fiscal 2016    
  On   October 20, 2015  , we acquired Cloud Sherpas (through its holding company, Declarative Holdings, Inc.), a leader in cloud advisory and technology services, for approximately   $409,424  , net of cash acquired. This acquisition enhances our ability to provide clients with cloud strategy and technology consulting, as well as cloud application implementation, integration and management services, and resulted in approximately   1,100     employees joining us. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded goodwill of   $385,337  ,   which was allocated to all five reportable operating segments, and intangible assets of   $66,522  , primarily related to customer-related intangibles. The goodwill is non-deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The intangible assets are being amortized over   one   to   seven   years. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on our operations were not material.    
  During fiscal 2016, we also completed other individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of   $458,892  , net of cash acquired. These acquisitions were completed primarily to expand our services and solutions offerings. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded goodwill of   $382,326   and intangible assets of   $109,981  .

Divestitures    
  Fiscal 2016    
  On   January 26, 2016  , we completed the sale of Navitaire LLC ( Navitaire ), a wholly owned subsidiary that provides technology and business solutions to the airline industry, to Amadeus IT Group, S.A. ( Amadeus ). Concurrent with the sale, we also entered into several arrangements to provide services to Amadeus, principally infrastructure outsourcing, over five years. We received a total of   $825,644  , net of transaction costs and cash divested, of which   $214,500   was recorded as deferred revenue attributable to arrangements to provide services to Amadeus. In connection with the sale of Navitaire, we recorded a gain of   $547,584   (reported in  Gain on sale of businesses  in the Consolidated Income Statements) and recorded related income taxes of   $55,759  . Approximately   600   Navitaire employees transferred to Amadeus as a part of this sale.    
  On   August 1, 2016  , we completed the transfer of our Duck Creek business to Apax Partners LLP in exchange for   $196,198  , net of transaction costs and cash divested, and a   40%   non-controlling interest in the newly formed joint venture, Duck Creek Technologies LLC ( Duck Creek ). Duck Creek s business is to accelerate the innovation of claims, billing and policy administration software for the insurance industry. In connection with the transaction, which resulted in the recording of the retained non-controlling interest at fair value, we recorded a gain of   $301,239   (reported in  Gain on sale of businesses  in the Consolidated Income Statements) and related income tax expense of   $48,286  . The fair value of our retained interest in Duck Creek was calculated based on the terms of the transfer and other factors related to the valuation of the non-controlling interest. Approximately     1,000   employees moved to Duck Creek as a part of this transaction.

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

Total amortization related to our intangible assets was   $170,187  ,   $149,417   and   $117,882   for fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  , respectively. Estimated future amortization related to intangible assets held at   August 31, 2018   is as follows:    

7.      DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
  In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. We classify cash flows from our derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statements.    
  Certain derivatives give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to us, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based on the gross fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in an asset position, was   $59,145   as of   August 31, 2018  .    
  We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. These provisions may reduce our potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and reduce a counterparty s potential overall loss resulting from our insolvency. Additionally, these agreements contain early termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty s credit rating, thereby enabling us to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease our realized loss on an open transaction. Similarly, a decrement in our credit rating could trigger a counterparty s early termination rights, thereby enabling a counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase our realized loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of   August 31, 2018   was   $140,690  .    
  Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note   10   (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  Cash Flow Hedges    
  Certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of our global delivery resources. To mitigate this risk, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. We have designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges. As of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , we held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment hedges.    
  In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly

  (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) 

effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. We assess the ongoing effectiveness of our hedges using the Hypothetical Derivative Method, which measures hedge ineffectiveness based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument and the change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative would have terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item. We measure and record hedge ineffectiveness at the end of each fiscal quarter.    
  For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders  Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statement during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were a net gain of   $93,105  ,     $118,840   and   $23,004   during   fiscal 2018  ,   2017   and   2016  , respectively.   The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in   Other income (expense), net   in the Consolidated Income Statement and for fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  , was not material. In addition, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges during fiscal   2018  ,   2017   or   2016  .    
  Other Derivatives    
  We also use foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were a net loss of   $114,076   for fiscal   2018  , a net gain of      $66,748   for fiscal   2017  , and a net loss of   $84,293   for fiscal   2016  . Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in   Other income (expense), net   in the Consolidated Income Statement and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.    
  Fair Value of Derivative Instruments    
  The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows:

We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows:    

8.      BORROWINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS    
  As of   August 31, 2018  , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes:    

_______________  
           (1) 
    This facility, which matures on   December 22, 2020  , provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a spread.   We   continue   to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of   August 31, 2018   and   2017  , we   had   no   borrowings under the facility. 
              (2) 
    We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , we had   no   borrowings under these facilities.    
              (3) 
    We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , we had   no   borrowings under these various facilities.    
     Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of   $324,602   and   $195,998   of letters of credit outstanding as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of   $25,013   and   $25,070   as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively.   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to     $1 billion  , backed by our syndicated loan facility.

9.      INCOME TAXES    

The components of Income before income taxes were as follows:    

_______________ 
   On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Act ), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from   35%   to   21%  , effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of   25.7%   for our fiscal year ended   August 31, 2018  .   Due to the recent enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we had previously recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements. In the three months ended   February 28, 2018  , we recognized a provisional tax expense of   $136,724   primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended   May 31, 2018  , we recorded an adjustment of   $40,927   to our provisional tax expense resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act.  While we now consider our analysis of these items under the Tax Act to be complete, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance.

The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate was as follows:    

_______________  
           (1) 
    Final determinations include final agreements with tax authorities and expirations of statutes of limitations.    
     As of   August 31, 2018  , we had not recognized a deferred tax liability on   $1,082,198   of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some countries may impose additional taxes. The unrecognized deferred tax liability (the amount payable if distributed) is approximately   $131,000  .    
  Portions of our operations are subject to reduced tax rates or are free of tax under various tax holidays which expire between fiscal   2019   and   2022  . Some of the holidays are renewable at reduced levels, under certain conditions, with possible renewal periods through   2032  . The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately   $103,000  ,   $95,000   and   $100,000   in fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  , respectively.

Changes in tax laws and tax rates decreased our net deferred tax assets by   $247,216   in fiscal   2018   and increased our net deferred tax assets by   $68,724   in fiscal   2017  .    
  The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following:    

We recorded valuation allowances of   $451,775   and   $1,564,554   as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax credit and tax net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. For all other deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal   2018  , we recorded a net decrease of   $1,112,779   in the valuation allowance. Substantially all of this change related to the write-off of certain tax credit carryforwards for which we had a full valuation allowance. During   fiscal 2017  , we recorded a net increase of   $321,347   in the valuation allowance. The majority of this change related to valuation allowances on certain tax credit carryforwards, as we believed it was more likely than not that these assets would not be realized.    
  We had tax credit carryforwards as of   August 31, 2018   of   $400,253  , of which   $19,976   will expire between   2019 and 2028  ,   $1,838   will expire between   2029 and 2038  , and   $378,439   has an indefinite carryforward period. We had net operating loss carryforwards as of   August 31, 2018   of   $478,274  . Of this amount,   $216,476   expires between   2019 and 2028  ,   $11,080     expires between   2029 and 2038  , and   $250,718   has an indefinite carryforward period.

As of   August 31, 2018  , we had   $1,210,520   of unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $818,638  , if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. As of   August 31, 2017  , we had   $945,850   of unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $609,555  , if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.     The remaining unrecognized tax benefits as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017   of   $391,882   and   $336,295  , respectively, represent items recorded as offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.    
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:    

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for income taxes. During fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  , we recognized expense of   $37,230  ,   $37,350   and   $8,681   in interest and penalties, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of   $125,886   (  $114,631  , net of tax benefits) and   $98,204   (  $87,417  , net of tax benefits) were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , respectively.    
  We are currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2016. We are also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, we do not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for the years before 2009. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately   $486,000     or increase by approximately   $219,000   in the next 12 months as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations, tax audit activity and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate to transfer pricing matters in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

10.      RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS    
  Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans    
  In the United States and certain other countries, we maintain and administer defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement medical plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. In addition, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is unfunded. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan. The defined benefit pension disclosures include our U.S. and material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.    
  Assumptions    
  The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31 and the net periodic pension expense were as follows:    

We utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This approach provides a correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a precise measurement of service and interest costs. The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and are subject to change each year. 
  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns on defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.

Assumed U.S. Health Care Cost Trend    
  Our U.S. postretirement plan assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of health care benefits is   6.9%   for the plan year ending June 30, 2019. The rate is assumed to decrease on a straight-line basis to     4.5%   for the plan year ending June 30, 2038 and remain at that level thereafter. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the benefit obligation by   $79,766  , while a one percentage point decrease would reduce the benefit obligation by   $62,785  .    
  U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Settlement Charges    
  In May 2017, we settled our U.S. pension plan obligations. Plan participants elected to receive either a lump-sum distribution or to transfer benefits to a third-party annuity provider. As a result of the settlement, we were relieved of any further obligation under our U.S. pension plan. During fiscal 2017, we recorded a pension settlement charge of   $509,793  , and related income tax benefits of   $198,219  . The charge primarily consisted of unrecognized actuarial losses of   $460,908   previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In connection with the settlement, we made a   $118,500   cash contribution (  $48,885   related to additional actuarial losses and   $69,615   to fund previously recorded pension liabilities).   In connection with the plan termination, we created a separate defined benefit plan, with substantially the same terms as the terminated plan, for approximately     600   active employees who are currently eligible to accrue benefits.    
  Pension and Postretirement Expense    
  Pension expense for fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016   was   $125,320  ,     $622,302  (including the above noted settlement charge)   and   $94,827  , respectively. Postretirement expense for fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016   was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Strategies    
  U.S. Pension Plans 
  The overall investment objective of the defined benefit pension plans is to match the duration of the plans  assets to the plans  liabilities while managing risk in order to meet current defined benefit pension obligations. The plans  future prospects, their current financial conditions, our current funding levels and other relevant factors suggest that the plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return in order to achieve long-term objectives without undue risk to the plans  ability to meet their current benefit obligations. We recognize that asset allocation of the defined benefit pension plans  assets is an important factor in determining long-term performance. Actual asset allocations at any point in time may vary from the target asset allocations and will be dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, required cash flows and investment decisions of the investment committee and the pension plans  investment funds and managers. Ranges are established to provide flexibility for the asset allocation to vary around the targets without the need for immediate rebalancing.    
  Non-U.S. Pension Plans    
  Plan assets in non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans conform to the investment policies and procedures of each plan and to relevant legislation. The pension committee or trustee of each plan regularly, but at least annually, reviews the investment policy and the performance of the investment managers. In certain countries, the trustee is also required to consult with us. Asset allocation decisions are made to provide risk adjusted returns that align with the overall investment strategy for each plan. Generally, the investment return objective of each plan is to achieve a total annualized rate of return that exceeds inflation over the long term by an amount based on the target asset allocation mix of that plan. In certain countries, plan assets are invested in funds that are required to hold a majority of assets in bonds, with a smaller proportion in equities. Also, certain plan assets are entirely invested in contracts held with the plan insurer, which determines the strategy. Defined benefit pension plans in certain countries are unfunded.    
  Risk Management    
  Plan investments are exposed to risks including market, interest rate and operating risk. In order to mitigate significant concentrations of these risks, the assets are invested in a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of fixed income instruments and equities. To minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, plan assets allocated to debt securities appropriately match the duration of individual plan liabilities. Equities are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds and are intended to achieve long term capital appreciation. Plan asset allocation and investment managers  guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis.    
  Plan Assets    
  Our target allocation for fiscal   2019   and weighted-average plan assets allocations as of   August 31, 2018 and 2017   by asset category for defined benefit pension plans were as follows:

Fair Value Measurements    
  Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.    
  The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:    
             
    Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;    
                
    Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and    
                
    Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.    
     The fair values of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets as of   August 31, 2018   were as follows:    

There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during   fiscal 2018  . The level 3 assets are invested in an insurance buy-in contract in a Non-U.S. plan. The fair value of the assets is set to an actuarially calculated present value of the underlying liabilities.     
  The U.S. Plans have   $239,289   in Level 2 assets, primarily made up of U.S. corporate debt securities of   $136,814     and U.S. government, state and local debt securities of   $58,239  .    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets for fiscal 2018:     

Expected Contributions    
  Generally, annual contributions are made at such times and in amounts as required by law and may, from time to time, exceed minimum funding requirements. We estimate we will pay approximately   $93,973   in fiscal     2019     related to contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and benefit payments related to the unfunded frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners. We have not determined whether we will make additional voluntary

contributions for our defined benefit pension plans. Our postretirement plan contributions in fiscal   2019   are not expected to be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.    
  Estimated Future Benefit Payments    
  Benefit payments for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:    

Defined Contribution Plans    
  In the United States and certain other countries, we maintain and administer defined contribution plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. Total expenses recorded for defined contribution plans were     $485,736  ,   $454,124   and   $419,932   in fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  , respectively.    
   
  11.      SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION    
  Share Incentive Plans    
  The Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan, as amended and approved by   our   shareholders in 2018 (the  Amended 2010 SIP ), is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture and provides for the grant of nonqualified share options, incentive stock options, restricted share units and other share-based awards. A maximum of   99,000,000   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares are currently authorized for awards under the Amended 2010 SIP. As of   August 31, 2018  , there were   24,266,070   shares available for future grants. Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares covered by awards that terminate, lapse or are cancelled may again be used to satisfy awards under the Amended 2010 SIP.   We   issue new Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and shares from treasury for shares delivered under the Amended 2010 SIP.    
  A summary of information with respect to share-based compensation is as follows:    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 excess tax benefits for share-based compensation were not recognized in the provision for income taxes. Therefore, fiscal 2016 excludes   $92,285   of excess tax benefits from the income tax provision.

Restricted Share Units    
  Under the Amended 2010 SIP, participants may be, and previously under the predecessor 2001 Share Incentive Plan were, granted restricted share units, each of which represent an unfunded, unsecured right to receive an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share on the date specified in the participant s award agreement. The fair value of the awards is based on   our stock price on the date of grant. The restricted share units granted under these plans are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging from   two   to   seven   years. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting term of each separately vesting portion. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting. Restricted share unit activity during fiscal   2018   was as follows:    

_______________ 
    As of   August 31, 2018  , there was   $924,824   of total unrecognized restricted share unit compensation expense related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.2   years. As of   August 31, 2018  , there were   598,447   restricted share units vested but not yet delivered as Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.    
  Stock Options    
  There were no stock options granted during fiscal   2018, 2017 or 2016  . As of   August 31, 2018   we had   12,274   stock options outstanding and exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of   $39.46   and a weighted average remaining contractual term of   1.2   years.    
  Employee Share Purchase Plan    
  2010 ESPP    
  The Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  2010 ESPP ) is a nonqualified plan that provides eligible employees of   Accenture plc and its designated affiliates   with an opportunity to purchase Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares through payroll deductions. Under the 2010 ESPP, eligible employees may purchase Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares through the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) or the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the  VEIP ). Under the ESPP, eligible employees may elect to contribute   1%   to   10%   of their eligible compensation during each semi-annual offering period (up to   $7.5   per offering period) to purchase Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at a discount. Under the VEIP, eligible members of Accenture Leadership may elect to contribute up to   30%   of their eligible compensation towards the monthly purchase of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at fair market value. At the end of the VEIP program year, Accenture Leadership participants who did not withdraw from the program will be granted restricted share units under the Amended 2010 SIP equal to   50%   of the number of shares purchased during that year and held by the participant as of the grant date. 
  A maximum of   90,000,000   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be issued under the 2010 ESPP. As of     August 31, 2018  ,   we had issued   54,111,908   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under the 2010 ESPP.     We   issued   5,428,356  ,   6,103,977   and   5,850,113   shares to employees in fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  , respectively, under the 2010 ESPP.

  Accenture plc    
  Ordinary Shares    
  We have   40,000   authorized   ordinary   shares, par value    1   per share. Each   ordinary   share of Accenture     plc entitles its holder to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture    however a holder of an   ordinary   share is not entitled to vote on matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture   plc or to receive dividends.    
  Class A Ordinary Shares    
  An Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to   one   vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. Each Class A ordinary share entitles its holder to a pro rata part of any dividend at the times and in the amounts, if any, which Accenture plc s Board of Directors from time to time determines to declare, subject to any preferred dividend rights attaching to any preferred shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled on a winding-up of Accenture plc to be paid a pro rata part of the value of the assets of Accenture plc remaining after payment of its liabilities, subject to any preferred rights on liquidation attaching to any preferred shares.    
  Class X Ordinary Shares    
  Most of our partners who received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure received a corresponding number of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares. An Accenture plc Class X ordinary share entitles its holder to   one   vote per share, and holders of those shares do not have cumulative voting rights. A Class X ordinary share does not entitle its holder to receive dividends, and holders of those shares are not entitled to be paid any amount upon a winding-up of Accenture plc. Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the par value of the Class X ordinary share. Accenture plc has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder, as the case may be. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc.    
  Equity of Subsidiaries Redeemable or Exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares    
  Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares    
  Partners resident in Canada and New Zealand received Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. We may, at our option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder.

13.      MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY    
  Share Purchases and Redemptions    
  The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding   for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and   for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, and prior to March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares, held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. As of   August 31, 2018  , our   aggregate available authorization was   $950,443   for   our publicly announced open-market share purchase   and these other share purchase programs.    
  Our share purchase activity during fiscal   2018   was as follows:    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.    
              (2) 
    During fiscal   2018  , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.    
              (3) 
    In connection with the internal merger described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in which Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, after which Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. Accordingly, as of   March 13, 2018  , there were no longer any ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc outstanding.    
     Other Share Redemptions    
  During fiscal   2018  , we   issued   25,906,176   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. The merger, described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) resulted in   25,554,372   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares being issued in exchange for Accenture Holdings plc shares on   March 13, 2018  . Additionally, prior to the merger, we issued   351,804   Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to a   registration statement on Form S-3 (the  registration statement ). Under the registration statement we,   at our option,   could issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc, we have terminated the registration statement.    
  Cancellation of Treasury Shares    
  During fiscal 2018, we cancelled     11,620,621     Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares that were held as treasury shares and had an aggregate cost of     $1,582,067  . The effect of the cancellation of these treasury shares was recognized in Class A ordinary shares and Additional paid-in capital with the residual recorded in Retained earnings. There was no effect on total shareholders  equity as a result of this cancellation  .

Dividends    
  Our dividend activity during fiscal   2018   was as follows:    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    The dividend for the   three months ended May 31, 2018   included payments made to holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares while the dividend for the   three months ended November 30, 2017   included payments made to holders of both Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) for additional information on Accenture Holdings plc.    
     The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.    
  Subsequent Events    
  On   September 26, 2018  , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of   $1.46     per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on   October 18, 2018   payable on   November 15, 2018  . The payment of the cash dividends will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. In addition, on   September 27, 2018  , we announced that we are changing the frequency of any cash dividend payments to shareholders during fiscal 2020 from semi-annual to quarterly.    
  On   September 26, 2018  , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved   $5,000,000   in additional share repurchase authority bringing Accenture s total outstanding authority to   $5,950,443  . 
   
  14.      LEASE COMMITMENTS    
  We have operating leases, principally for office space, with various renewal options. Substantially all operating leases are non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. Rental expense in agreements with rent holidays and scheduled rent increases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental expense, including operating costs and taxes, and sublease income from third parties during fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016   was as follows:

Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of   August 31, 2018   were as follows:    

15.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  Commitments    
  We have the right to purchase at fair value, or if certain events occur may be required to purchase at fair value, the outstanding shares of our SinnerSchrader AG subsidiary. As of August 31, 2018, the fair value of the redeemable common stock of SinnerSchrader AG of   $46,703   was included in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  During fiscal 2018, we purchased shares related to the remaining outstanding redeemable common stock and options on redeemable common stock of our Avanade Inc. subsidiary and eliminated the liability, which was   $52,996   as of August 31, 2017 and was included in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  Indemnifications and Guarantees    
  In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.    
  Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments we made in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the client s claim. Payments we made under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.    
  As of   August 31, 2018 and 2017  , our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately     $782,000   and   $697,000  , respectively, of which all but approximately   $130,000   and   $149,000  , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.    
  To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.

Legal Contingencies 
  As of   August 31, 2018  , we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
   
  16.      SEGMENT REPORTING    
  Operating segments are components of an enterprise where separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.    
  Our chief operating decision makers are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Our operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit providing consulting and outsourcing services to clients in different industries.    
     Our reportable operating segments are the five operating groups, which are Communications, Media   Technology, Financial Services, Health   Public Service, Products and Resources. Information regarding our reportable operating segments is as follows: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Amounts include depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets controlled by each operating segment, as well as an allocation for amounts they do not directly control.    
              (2) 
    We do not allocate total assets by operating segment. Operating segment assets directly attributed to an operating segment and provided to the chief operating decision makers include receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services, deferred contract costs and current and non-current deferred revenues.    
              (3) 
    Other operating income for fiscal 2017 represents the pension settlement charge. 
     The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our business in the United States represented   43%  ,   45%   and   46%   of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  , respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.   Business in Ireland, our country of domicile, represented approximately   1%   of our consolidated net revenues during each of fiscal   2018, 2017 and 2016  .    
  We conduct business in Ireland and in the following countries that hold 10% or more of our total consolidated Property and equipment, net:

 FORM OF INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.28 
    
  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
  This Indemnification Agreement (this    Agreement   ) is entered into as of [________________] (the    Effective Date   ) between (a) Accenture Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, controlled subsidiary of Accenture plc (the    Indemnitor   ), and (b) [____________] (the    Indemnitee   ). 
  RECITALS 
  WHEREAS, Accenture plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of the Republic of Ireland (   Accenture   ), is the ultimate parent company of the Indemnitor and a direct or indirect stockholder of the Indemnitor (as the case may be from time to time); 
  WHEREAS, the Indemnitor desires to ensure that Accenture benefits from the services of highly competent persons such as the Indemnitee; 
  WHEREAS, Accenture and the Indemnitor believe that in order to attract and retain highly competent persons such as the Indemnitee to serve as directors and officers, it is appropriate to provide such persons with adequate protection through indemnification and advancement against risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of Accenture; 
  WHEREAS, Accenture and the Indemnitor have requested that the Indemnitee serve and continue to serve as a director or officer of Accenture and in any other capacity with respect to Accenture as Accenture may request; and  
  WHEREAS, Accenture desires to have the Indemnitee serve and continue to serve as a director or officer of Accenture and in any other capacity with respect to Accenture as Accenture may request, and the Indemnitee desires to be indemnified by the Indemnitor and has agreed to serve and continue to serve Accenture in reliance upon the Indemnitor s promise to provide indemnification and other protections to the Indemnitee on the basis hereinafter set forth. 
  AGREEMENT 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Indemnitee s continued service as a director or officer of Accenture, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.  Definitions  .  For purposes of this Agreement: 
  (a)      A    Change in Control    will be deemed to have occurred if, with respect to any particular 24-month period, the individuals who, at the beginning of such 24-month period, constituted the Board of Directors of Accenture (the    Incumbent Board   ) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors;   provided  ,   however  , that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the beginning of such 24-month period whose election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of Accenture, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board of Directors. 
  (b)         Company    means Accenture and any of its subsidiaries, including the Indemnitor.   

(c)         Disinterested Director    means a director of Accenture, in Accenture s capacity as the ultimate parent company and a direct or indirect stockholder of the Indemnitor, who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is being sought by the Indemnitee from the Indemnitor, and the    Board of Directors    means the Board of Directors of Accenture, acting on behalf of Accenture in Accenture s capacity as the ultimate parent company and a direct or indirect stockholder of the Indemnitor. 
  (d)         Enterprise    means any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including an employee benefit plan, but not including Accenture or any subsidiary of Accenture, that the Indemnitee, while a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of Accenture, is or was serving at the request of Accenture as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee.    
  (e)         Expenses    includes, without limitation, expenses incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, judicial, administrative, or legislative hearing, or any other threatened, pending, or completed proceeding, including any and all appeals, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, investigative, or other nature, attorneys  fees, witness fees and expenses, fees and expenses of accountants and other advisors, retainers and disbursements and advances thereon, the premium, security for, and other costs relating to any bond (including cost bonds, appraisal bonds, or their equivalents), and any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification or advancement under Sections 9, 11, 13, and 16 hereof, but shall not include the amount of judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, or penalties actually levied against the Indemnitee, or any amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the Indemnitee. 
  (f)         Independent Counsel    means a law firm or a member of a law firm that neither is presently nor in the past five years has been retained to represent (i) the Company or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a request for indemnification hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term  Independent Counsel  shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee s right to indemnification under this Agreement. 
  (g)         Proceeding    means any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, judicial, administrative, or legislative hearing, or any other threatened, pending, or completed proceeding, including any and all appeals, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, investigative, or other nature, to which the Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company or while a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another Enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity, whether or not the Indemnitee is serving in such capacity at the time any expense, liability, or loss is incurred for which indemnification or advancement can be provided under this Agreement. 
  2.        Service by the Indemnitee  .  The Indemnitee shall serve and/or continue to serve as a director or officer of Accenture faithfully and to the best of the Indemnitee s ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed and until such time as the Indemnitee s successor is elected and qualified or the Indemnitee is removed as permitted by applicable law or resigns.  By entering into this Agreement, the Indemnitee is deemed to be serving at the request of Accenture and the Indemnitor, which are deemed to be requesting such service. 
  3.        Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses  .  The Indemnitor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitee, and shall pay to the Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding all Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in defending any such Proceeding, to the fullest  
  
   2 

extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the    DGCL   ), as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, all on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  Without diminishing the scope of the rights provided by this Section, the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided hereunder shall include but shall not be limited to those rights hereinafter set forth, except that no indemnification or advancement of Expenses shall be paid to the Indemnitee: 
  (a)      to the extent expressly prohibited by applicable law;  
  (b)      for and to the extent that payment is actually made to the Indemnitee under a valid and collectible insurance policy or under a valid and enforceable indemnity clause, provision of the governing documents, or agreement of the Company (and the Indemnitee shall reimburse the Company for any amounts paid by the Company and subsequently so recovered by the Indemnitee); or 
  (c)      in connection with an action, suit, or proceeding, or part thereof voluntarily initiated by the Indemnitee (including claims and counterclaims, whether such counterclaims are asserted by (i) the Indemnitee, or (ii) the Company in an action, suit, or proceeding initiated by the Indemnitee), except a judicial proceeding pursuant to Section 11 to enforce rights under this Agreement, unless the action, suit, or proceeding, or part thereof, was authorized or ratified by Accenture, in its capacity as the ultimate parent company and a direct or indirect stockholder of the Indemnitor, in a decision by the Board of Directors of Accenture, or the Board of Directors otherwise determines that indemnification or advancement of Expenses is appropriate in such instance. 
  4.        Third-Party Actions or Proceedings  .  Except as limited by Section 3 above, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section if the Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or was or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company or while a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another Enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity.  Pursuant to this Section, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expense, liability, and loss (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. 
  5.        Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company  .  Except as limited by Section 3 above, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided in this Section if the Indemnitee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or was or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company or while a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of  another Enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity.  Pursuant to this Section, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company;   provided  ,   however  , that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the DGCL expressly prohibits such indemnification by reason of any adjudication of liability of the Indemnitee to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for such expense, liability, and loss as such court shall deem proper. 
  
   3 

6.        Indemnification for Costs, Charges, and Expenses of Successful Party  .  Notwithstanding any limitations of Sections 3(c), 4, and 5 above, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in whole or in part, in defense of any Proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, including, without limitation, the dismissal of any action without prejudice, or if it is ultimately determined, by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal, that the Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to be indemnified against Expenses, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith. 
  7.        Partial Indemnification  .  If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification for some or a portion of the expense, liability, and loss (including judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties, amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, and Expenses) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any Proceeding, or in connection with any judicial proceeding pursuant to Section 11 to enforce rights under this Agreement, but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Indemnitor shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expense, liability, and loss actually and reasonably incurred to which the Indemnitee is entitled. 
  8.        Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by the DGCL, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on the Indemnitee s behalf if the Indemnitee appears as a witness or otherwise incurs legal expenses as a result of or related to the Indemnitee s service as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company, in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, judicial, administrative, or legislative hearing, or any other threatened, pending, or completed proceeding, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, investigative, or other nature, to which the Indemnitee neither is, nor is threatened to be made, a party. 
  9.        Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification  .  To receive indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit a written request to the Company, to the attention of an appropriate individual designated from time to time.  Such request shall include documentation or information that is necessary for such determination and is reasonably available to the Indemnitee.  Upon receipt by the Company of a written request by the Indemnitee for indemnification, the entitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification from the Indemnitor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to the extent not required pursuant to the terms of Section 6 or Section 8 of this Agreement, shall be determined by Accenture, in its capacity as the ultimate parent company and a direct or indirect stockholder of the Indemnitor, in a decision by the following person or persons who shall be empowered to make such determination (as selected by the Board of Directors, except with respect to Section 9(d) below):  (a) the Board of Directors of Accenture by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; (b) a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; (c) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; or (d) in the event that a Change in Control has occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee.  Such Independent Counsel shall be selected by Accenture, in a decision by the Board of Directors, and approved by the Indemnitee, except that in the event that a Change in Control has occurred, Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee.  Upon failure of the Board of Directors so to select such Independent Counsel or upon failure of the Indemnitee so to approve (or so to select, in the event a Change in Control has occurred), such Independent Counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction.  The determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made and, unless a contrary determination is made, such indemnification shall be paid in full not later than 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification.  If it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification as to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such partial indemnification shall be reasonably prorated among the claims, issues, or matters at issue at the time of the determination. 
  
   4 

10.        Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings  .  Upon making a request for indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Indemnitor shall have the burden of proof in making any determination contrary to such presumption.  If the requested determination with respect to indemnification has not been made within 60 calendar days after receipt by the Company of such request, a requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and the Indemnitee shall be absolutely entitled to such indemnification, absent actual fraud in the request for indemnification.  The termination of any Proceeding described in Sections 4 or 5 by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of   nolo contendere   or its equivalent, shall not, of itself  (a) create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful or (b) otherwise adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnification except as may be provided herein. 
  11.        Remedies of the Indemnitee in Cases of Determination Not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses; Right to Bring Suit  .  In the event that a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or if payment is not timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Sections 9 and 10, or if an advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 16, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit seeking an adjudication of entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses, and any such suit shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.  The Indemnitor shall not oppose the Indemnitee s right to seek any such adjudication.  In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of Expenses), it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in the DGCL, including the standard described in Section 4 or 5, as applicable.  Further, in any suit brought by the Indemnitor to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to recover such Expenses upon a final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct described above.  Neither the failure of the Indemnitor to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct described above, nor an actual determination by the Indemnitor that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct described above shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct described above, or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.  In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the Indemnitor to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Section 11 or otherwise shall be on the Indemnitor.  If a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to the terms of Section 9 or 10 that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Indemnitor shall be bound by such determination and are precluded from asserting that such determination has not been made or that the procedure by which such determination was made is not valid, binding, and enforceable.  The Indemnitor further agrees to stipulate in any court pursuant to this Section 11 that it is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement and is precluded from making any assertions to the contrary.  If the court shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder, the Indemnitor shall pay all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings) to the fullest extent permitted by law, and in any suit brought by the Indemnitor to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitor shall pay all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such suit to the extent the Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in whole or in part, in defense of such suit, to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
  12.        Non-Exclusivity of Rights  .  The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right that the  
  
   5 

Indemnitee may now or hereafter acquire under any applicable law, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors, provisions of any governing documents (including those of the Company and the Indemnitor), or otherwise. 
  13.        Expenses to Enforce Agreement  .  In the event that the Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in any action, suit, or proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or seeks an adjudication to enforce the Indemnitee s rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, the Indemnitee, if the Indemnitee prevails in whole or in part in such action, suit, or proceeding, shall be entitled to recover from the Indemnitor and shall be indemnified by the Indemnitor against any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith. 
  14.        Continuation of Indemnity  .  All agreements and obligations of the Indemnitor contained herein shall continue during the period the Indemnitee is a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company or while a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee is serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another Enterprise, and shall continue thereafter with respect to any possible claims based on the fact that the Indemnitee was a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of the Company or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent, or trustee of another Enterprise.  This Agreement shall be binding upon all successors and assigns of the Indemnitor (including any transferee of all or substantially all of its assets and any successor by merger or operation of law) and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee s heirs, executors, and administrators. 
  15.        Notification and Defense of Proceeding  .  Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of any Proceeding, the Indemnitee shall, if a request for indemnification or an advancement of Expenses in respect thereof is to be made under this Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof (with such notice directed to the attention of an appropriate individual designated from time to time); but the omission so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any such Proceeding of which the Indemnitee notifies the Company: 
  (a)      The Company shall be entitled to participate therein at its own expense;  
  (b)      Except as otherwise provided in this Section 15(b), to the extent that it may wish, the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnitee.  After notice from the Company to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any expenses of counsel subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof except as otherwise provided below.  The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ the Indemnitee s own counsel in such Proceeding, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such Proceeding, or (iii) the Company shall not within 60 calendar days of receipt of notice from the Indemnitee in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of the Proceeding, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of the Indemnitee s counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnitor.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which the Indemnitee shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above; and 
  (c)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Company s written consent, or for any judicial or other award, if the Company was not given an opportunity, in accordance with this Section 15, to participate in the defense of such Proceeding.  The Company shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation  
  
   6 

on or disclosure obligation with respect to the Indemnitee, or that would directly or indirectly constitute or impose any admission or acknowledgment of fault or culpability with respect to the Indemnitee, without the Indemnitee s written consent.  Neither the Company, nor the Indemnitee, shall unreasonably withhold consent to any proposed settlement. 
  16.        Advancement of Expenses  .  All Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in defending any Proceeding described in Section 4 or 5 shall be paid by the Indemnitor in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding at the request of the Indemnitee.  The Indemnitee s right to advancement shall not be subject to the satisfaction of any standard of conduct and advances shall be made without regard to the Indemnitee s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise.  To receive an advancement of Expenses under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit a written request to the Company, to the attention of an appropriate individual designated from time to time.  Such request shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee.  The Indemnitee hereby undertakes to repay all amounts so advanced (without interest) if it shall ultimately be determined, by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such Expenses as provided by this Agreement or otherwise.  The Indemnitee s undertaking to repay any such amounts is not required to be secured, and no other form of undertaking shall be required of the Indemnitee other than the execution of this Agreement.  Each such advancement of Expenses shall be made within 20 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of such written request.  The Indemnitee s entitlement to Expenses under this Agreement shall include those incurred in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding by the Indemnitee seeking an adjudication pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement (including the enforcement of this provision) to the extent the court shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to an advancement of Expenses hereunder. 
  17.        Severability; Prior Indemnification Agreements  .  If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law (a) the validity, legality, and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraphs of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not by themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities or circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent of the parties that the Indemnitee shall receive protection to the fullest extent set forth in this Agreement.  This Agreement shall supersede and replace any prior indemnification agreements entered into by and between the Company and the Indemnitee and any such prior agreements shall be terminated upon execution of this Agreement. 
  18.        Headings; References; Pronouns  .  The headings of the sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.  References herein to section numbers are to sections of this Agreement.  All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the singular or plural as appropriate. 
  19.        Other Provisions  . 
  (a)      This Agreement, and all disputes or controversies arising out of or related to this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware (including the DGCL), without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of conflicts of laws principles of the State of Delaware or any other state or jurisdiction.  If a court of competent jurisdiction shall make a final determination that the provisions of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware govern indemnification by the Indemnitor of the Indemnitee, then this  
  
   7 

Agreement shall in all instances be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted under such law, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary.  
  (b)      The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:  (i) agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (the    Chancery Court   ) or, if the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, another state court or federal court located within the State of Delaware; (ii) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Delaware for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement; (iii) agree, to the extent the Indemnitor or the Indemnitee are not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as its agent in the State of Delaware for acceptance of legal process with respect to matters involving this Agreement, and that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the U.S. Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service, and that service by either of the foregoing means shall have the same legal force and validity as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware; (iv) waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement in the courts of the State of Delaware, and (v) waive, and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in the courts of the State of Delaware has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum.   
  (c)      This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party. 
  (d)      This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract with any Indemnitee who is an officer of Accenture, and, if the Indemnitee is an officer of Accenture, the Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that the Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, and with or without severance compensation, except as may be otherwise provided in a separate written contract between the Indemnitee and Accenture. 
  (e)      In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee (excluding insurance obtained on the Indemnitee s own behalf), and the Indemnitee shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Indemnitor effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
  (f)      This Agreement may not be amended, modified, or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each party.  No failure or delay of either party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

 AMENDED AND RESTATED ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN FINANCIALS

Exhibit 

Exhibit 99.1 
  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  To the Participants of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Accenture plc: 
  Opinion on the Financial Statements 
  We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plan) as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, the related statements of operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three year period ended August 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Plan as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and changes in plan equity for each of the years in the three year period ended August 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  Basis for Opinion 
  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Plan in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  We have served as the Company s auditor since 2010.

AMENDED AND RESTATED ACCENTURE PLC 2010 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.    PLAN DESCRIPTION 
  The following description of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  Plan ) is provided for general information purposes. Participants in the Plan should refer to the Plan document for more detailed and complete information. Under the Plan, there are two programs through which participants may purchase shares: (1) the Employee Share Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) and (2) the Voluntary Equity Investment Program (the  VEIP ). 
  General 
  Under the Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of Accenture plc (the  Company ) at their February 4, 2010 meeting, and approved by the Board of Directors (the  Board ) on December 10, 2009, the Company was authorized to issue or transfer up to   45,000,000   Class A ordinary shares ( Shares ) of the Company. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the  Committee ), which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines, provided, however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under the Plan as it may deem necessary.  The Company pays all expenses of the Plan. The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or previously issued Shares that have been reacquired. 
  At its October 30, 2015 meeting, the Board delegated to the Committee the authority to approve the issuance of an additional   45,000,000   Shares of the Company under the Plan. At its December 4, 2015 meeting, the Committee approved the issuance of an additional   45,000,000   Shares under the Plan, subject to shareholder approval. The Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company at the February 3, 2016 annual general meeting. 
  The Plan provides eligible employees of the Company or of a participating subsidiary with an opportunity to purchase Shares at a purchase price established by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than 85% of the fair market value of a Share on the purchase date. 
  The fair market value on a given date is defined as the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices of the Shares as reported on such date on the composite tape of the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading, or, if no sale of Shares shall have been reported on the composite tape of any national securities exchange on such date, then the immediately preceding date on which sales of the Shares have been so reported or quoted shall be used. 
  In general, any individual who is an employee of the Company or of a participating subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Plan, except that the Committee may exclude employees (either individually or by reference to a subset thereof) from participation (1) whose customary employment is less than five months per calendar year or 20 hours or less per week; (2) who own shares equaling 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any subsidiary; or (3) who are highly compensated employees under the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ). The Plan does not currently qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code and therefore receipt of the Shares will be a taxable event to the participant. The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 
  Contributions 
  Payroll deductions will generally be made from the compensation paid to each participant during an offering period in a whole percentage as elected by the participant but not to exceed the maximum percentage of the participant s eligible compensation (or maximum dollar amount) as permitted by the Committee. Under the ESPP, the maximum whole percentage is   10%   (up to a maximum of   $7,500   per offering period), provided that no participant will be entitled to purchase, during any calendar year, Shares with an aggregate value in excess of $25,000. Under the VEIP, eligible participants may choose to contribute up to 30% of their eligible compensation towards the purchase of Shares. The amount of the contributions is based on pre-tax cash compensation, but contributions are deducted from after-tax pay each pay period. The Committee retains the discretion to impose an aggregate participation limit under the VEIP. If aggregate participant contributions are projected to exceed such limit, contributions will stop and participants will be refunded contributions not used to purchase Shares. In fiscal 2018, there was no aggregate participation limit under the VEIP.

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       (continued) 

A participant may elect his or her percentage of payroll deductions, and change that election, prior to the end of the applicable enrollment period as determined by the Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a participant cannot change the rate of payroll deductions once an offering period has commenced. All payroll deductions made with respect to a participant are credited to the participant s payroll deduction account and are deposited with the general funds of the Company. All funds of participants received or held by the Company under the Plan before purchase or issuance of the Shares are held without liability for interest or other increment   (unless otherwise required by law)  . Under the Plan, the ESPP offering periods in fiscal   2018   included the six-month periods ended   November 1, 2017   and   May 1, 2018  . The current offering period commenced on May 2,   2018   and will end on November 1,   2018  . The VEIP has a calendar year offering period, as well as a limited mid-year enrollment period, and monthly contribution periods in which shares are purchased on the 5th of the subsequent month. 
  Share Purchases 
  As soon as practicable following the end of each ESPP offering period or VEIP contribution period, the number of Shares purchased by each participant is deposited into a brokerage account established in the participant s name. Dividends that are declared on the Shares held in the brokerage account are paid in cash or reinvested. A summary of information with respect to share purchases was as follows:

Withdrawals 
  Each participant may withdraw from participation in respect of an offering period (either current or future) or from the Plan under such terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion. Upon a participant s withdrawal, all accumulated payroll deductions in the participant s Plan account are returned without interest (to the extent permitted by applicable local law). A participant is not entitled to any Shares with respect to the applicable offering period, except under the VEIP for those shares purchased in contribution periods prior to withdrawal. A participant is permitted to participate in subsequent offering periods pursuant to terms and conditions established by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
  Adjustments 
  The number of Shares issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan   (or pursuant to outstanding purchase  
  rights  ) is subject to adjustment on account of share splits, share dividends and other changes in the Shares. In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may take any actions it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any   purchase rights   as of the date of consummation of the change in control. 
  Plan Amendment and Termination 
  The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, provided, however, that no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made that would increase the total number of Shares authorized for the Plan   without prior shareholder consent  , or, without a participant s consent, would materially adversely affect the participant s rights and obligations under the Plan. The Plan will terminate upon the earliest of: (1) the termination of the Plan by the Board; (2) the issuance of all of the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan; or (3) December 10, 2024. The Board has not initiated actions to terminate the Plan, and unless otherwise noted, has not amended the Plan.
