PART I       Item 1         
    Note About Forward-Looking Statements    
  This report includes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that are
 forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements
may appear throughout this report, including the following sections:  Business,   Management s Discussion and Analysis,  and  Risk Factors.  These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words
 believe,   project,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   intend,   strategy,   future,   opportunity,   plan,   may,   should, 
 will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely result,  and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in  Risk Factors  (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K),
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  (Part II, Item 7A), and  Management s Discussion and Analysis  (Part II, Item 7). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.       PART I    
     ITEM 1. BUSINESS        GENERAL        Our vision       Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a
mobile-first, cloud-first world.      The mobile-first, cloud-first world is transforming the way individuals and organizations use and
interact with technology. Our worldview for mobile-first is not about the mobility of devices; it is centered on the mobility of experiences that, in turn, are orchestrated by the cloud. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and
enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. Mobility encompasses the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany our customers as they move from setting to setting in
their lives. We are transforming our businesses to enable Microsoft to lead the direction of this transformation, and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world.       What we offer       Founded in 1975, we operate worldwide and have offices in more than 100
countries. We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people s lives. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based
services, to consumers and businesses. We design, manufacture, and sell devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and we deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience.   
  Our products include operating systems for computing devices, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices; server applications for distributed
computing environments; cross-device productivity applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and online advertising. We also design and sell hardware including PCs,
tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. We offer cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content. We also provide consulting and product and
solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers.

PART I       Item 1         
    The ambitions that drive us       To carry out our strategy, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:       

Reinvent productivity and business processes.          

Build the intelligent cloud platform.          

Create more personal computing.      
   Reinvent productivity and business processes    
  We believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of communication, productivity, and information
services that spans devices and platforms. Productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We will design applications as dual-use with the
intelligence to partition data between work and life while respecting each person s privacy choices. The foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, and business process tools including Skype,
OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Bing, and Dynamics. With Office 365, we provide these familiar industry-leading productivity and business process tools as cloud services, enabling access from anywhere and any device. This
creates an opportunity to reach new customers, and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers.      We see opportunity in
combining our offerings in new ways that are more contextual and personal, while ensuring people, rather than their devices, remain at the center of the digital experience. We will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own. As
people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. We are engineering our applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.       Build the intelligent cloud platform       In deploying technology that advances business strategy,
enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, and connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. To achieve these objectives,
increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength.   
  The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly
lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers
application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As one of the largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we are well-positioned to help businesses move to the cloud so that businesses can focus on innovation while leaving
non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers like Microsoft.      With Azure, we are one of very few cloud
vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe the combination of Azure and Windows Server makes us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern
business. We are working to enhance the return on information technology ( IT ) investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses can deploy
applications in their own datacenter, a partner s datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they want.   
  We enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications (both our own and third-party) and integrate them with their existing
security and management infrastructure. We will continue to innovate with higher-level services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across
a growing number of devices, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer   
         4

productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our digital work and life experiences will also be extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our
solutions, achieving even more value. This strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services.       Create more personal computing       Windows 10 is the cornerstone of our ambition to usher in
an era of more personal computing. We see the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 as a critical, transformative moment for the Company because we will move from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of
devices in our customers  lives. We developed Windows 10 not only to be familiar to our users, but more safe and secure, and always up-to-date. We believe Windows 10 is more personal and productive, working seamlessly with functionality such as
Cortana, Office, Continuum, and universal applications. We designed Windows 10 to foster innovation   from us, our partners and developers   through experiences such as our new browser Microsoft Edge, across the range of existing devices,
and into entirely new device categories.      Our ambition for Windows 10 is to broaden our economic opportunity through three key levers:
an original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) ecosystem that creates exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10; our own commitment to the health and profitability of our first-party premium device portfolio; and monetization opportunities
such as services, subscriptions, gaming, and search. Our OEM partners are investing in an extensive portfolio of hardware designs and configurations as they ready for Windows 10. By December 2015, we anticipate the widest range of Windows hardware
ever to be available.      With the launch of Windows 10, we are realizing our vision of a single, unified Windows operating system on which
developers and OEMs can contribute to a thriving Windows ecosystem. We invest heavily to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. We are working to create a broad developer
opportunity by unifying the installed base to Windows 10 through upgrades and ongoing updates, and by enabling universal Windows applications to run across all device targets. As part of our strategic objectives, we are committed to designing and
marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem, including across PCs, phones, tablets, consoles, wearables, large multi-touch displays, and new categories such as the
HoloLens holographic computing platform. We are developing new input/output methods like speech, pen, gesture, and augmented reality holograms to power more personal computing experiences with Windows 10.   
   Our future opportunity       There are several
distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:   

Delivering new productivity, entertainment, and business processes to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one
another.          

Establishing the Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, other devices, and the cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the
cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.          

Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.      

Developing new devices that have increasingly natural ways to interact with them, including speech, pen, gesture, and augmented reality holograms.

Applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command.      
  We believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large global partner and customer base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing
investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas and differentiate ourselves from competitors.

PART I       Item 1         
    OPERATING SEGMENTS       We operate our business in six segments. Our Devices and Consumer ( D C ) segments include D C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D C Other. Our Commercial segments
include Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing,
and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our
transformation in the mobile-first, cloud-first world. As we evolve how we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure, it is possible that our segments may change.   
  On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation s ( Nokia ) Devices and Services Business
( NDS ). We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our
D C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.      Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 22   Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part
II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).       Devices and Consumer       Our D C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed
decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D C segments are made up of D C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D C Other.       D C Licensing       The principal products and services provided by the D C Licensing
segment are: Windows, including all OEM licensing ( Windows OEM ) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the
core Office product set, for consumers ( Office Consumer  Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue.   
  The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience,
applications, and information across their devices.      Windows revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system
licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted by:       

The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.      

Differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets.      

Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.          

Customer mix between consumer, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises.      

Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.          

Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large,
multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.          

Piracy.

PART I       Item 1         
   The versions of Office included in our D C Licensing segment are designed to increase personal
productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as content management and
collaboration. Office Consumer revenue is impacted by sales to customers that buy Office with their new devices and by product launches, as well as the transition to Office 365 Consumer, our subscription-based cloud service that provides access to
Office plus other productivity services. Office 365 Consumer revenue is included in our D C Other segment.      The Windows Phone
operating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they need. As noted above, prior to our acquisition of NDS, Microsoft and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services and extended established
products and services to new markets through a strategic alliance. Windows Phone revenue associated with this contractual relationship was reflected in D C Licensing. Windows Phone revenue also includes revenue from licensing mobile-related
patents.       Competition       The
Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an
easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity, and the largest support network for any operating system.   
  Competitors to the versions of Office included in D C Licensing include global application vendors such as Apple and Google, numerous web-based
and mobile application competitors, and local application developers in Asia and Europe. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email, note-taking, and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones.
Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications can also position themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of
providing powerful, flexible, secure, and easy to use solutions that work across a variety of devices.      Windows Phone operating system
faces competition from iOS, Android, and Blackberry operating systems. Windows Phone competes based on differentiated user interface, personalized applications, compatibility with Windows PCs and tablets, and other unique capabilities.   
   Computing and Gaming Hardware       The
principal products and services provided by the Computing and Gaming Hardware segment are: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions ( Xbox
Platform  Surface devices and accessories ( Surface  and Microsoft PC accessories.      The Xbox Platform is designed to
provide a unique variety of entertainment choices through the use of our devices, peripherals, content, and online services. We released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November 2005 and November 2013, respectively.   
  Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers to be more productive. Our latest Surface devices, the Surface Pro 3 and Surface
3, were released in June 2014 and May 2015, respectively.       Competition       Our Xbox Platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established base of customers. The lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years.
Nintendo released their latest generation console in November 2012. Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013.   
         7

PART I       Item 1         
   We believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of
games for the console, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the console, and the ability to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals. In addition to
Sony and Nintendo, we compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces. We believe the Xbox Platform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in
hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.   
  Surface devices face competition from Apple, as well as other computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers, many of which are also current or
potential partners and customers.       Phone Hardware       The principal products provided by the Phone Hardware segment are Lumia phones and other non-Lumia phones, which we began manufacturing and selling with the acquisition of NDS on April 25, 2014. Our Lumia
phones run Windows and are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most, using integrated Microsoft services such as Outlook, OneDrive, Skype, and Office.  
   Competition       Our phones face competition
primarily from Apple, Samsung, and many other mobile device manufacturers running the Android operating system, and offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative imaging technologies across various price points.
      D C Other       The principal
products and services provided by the D C Other segment are: Resale, consisting of transactions in our Windows Store and Xbox marketplace; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365
Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; Mojang; and non-Microsoft products sold in our retail stores.      Our online
application marketplaces are designed to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base and benefit users by providing centralized access to certified applications. Xbox Live transactions consist of online
entertainment content, such as games, music, movies, and TV shows, accessible on Xbox consoles and other devices.      Search and display
advertising includes Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, and Xbox ads. We have a partnership with Yahoo! in which we provide algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! websites worldwide. In June 2015, we entered into agreements with AOL and AppNexus to
outsource our display sales efforts.      Office 365 Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of Microsoft
Office programs and services delivered across multiple platforms via the cloud.      Studios designs and markets games for Xbox consoles,
Windows-enabled devices, and online. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users and increase engagement by developing a deep library of content that consumers seek.      We acquired Mojang Synergies AB ( Mojang ), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, in November 2014.

   Our search and display advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites,
social platforms like Facebook, and portals like Yahoo! that provide content and online offerings to end users. Our success depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser
offerings. We believe we can attract new users by continuing to offer new and compelling products and services.      Competitors to Office
365 Consumer are the same as those discussed above for Office Consumer.      Competitors to Studios and Mojang are the same as those
discussed above for our Xbox gaming and entertainment business, as well as game studios like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.       Commercial
      Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and
organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user s hardware and software. Commercial is made up of the Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other segments.   
   Commercial Licensing       The principal
products and services provided by the Commercial Licensing segment are: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses ( CALs  Microsoft Office for
business, including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and related CALs ( Office Commercial  volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic ( Windows Commercial  Microsoft Dynamics
business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; Windows Embedded; and Skype.      Our server products are designed to make information
technology professionals and developers and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This
includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle
tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Revenue comes from purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged product. CALs provide access rights to certain server products,
including Windows Server and SQL Server. CAL revenue is reported along with the associated server product.      The versions of Office in
Commercial Licensing are designed to increase personal, team, and organizational productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of the demand from commercial
customers for volume licensing and software assurance and the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise. Office Commercial revenue growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set and to continue to expand our product
offerings in other areas such as content management, enterprise search, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. CALs provide access rights to certain Office Commercial products, including Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for
Business, formerly Lync. CAL revenue is reported along with the associated Office product.      Windows Commercial includes volume licensing
of the Windows operating system, excluding academic. Windows Commercial revenue is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed
enterprise, and is therefore relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.      Microsoft Dynamics products provide
business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven
by the number of information workers licensed.

   Windows Embedded extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems, including the
Internet of Things ( IoT ), by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services.      Skype is designed to connect
friends, family, clients, and colleagues through a variety of devices. Revenue is largely driven by the sale of minutes, subscriptions, and advertising.   
   Competition       Our server products face
competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of
the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also
benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.   
  We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and
middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that
competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes
with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java middleware vendors.      Our system
management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete
with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, other companies, and open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM,
Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails, among others.      We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in
performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.   
  Competitors to Office Commercial includes software application vendors such as Adobe Systems, Apple, Cisco Systems, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and
numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides
a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing
powerful, flexible, secure, easy to use solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have and are available on a device or via the cloud.      Competitors to Windows Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Windows in the D C Licensing segment.      Our Microsoft Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Oracle and SAP in the market for large organizations and divisions of global enterprises. In the market focused on providing solutions for small and
mid-sized businesses, our Microsoft Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Infor, The Sage Group, and NetSuite. Salesforce.com s cloud customer relationship management ( CRM ) offerings compete directly with Microsoft
Dynamics CRM on-premises offerings.

   Skype competes with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers,
ranging from start-ups to established enterprises.       Commercial Other       The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Other segment are: Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, Microsoft Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and other Microsoft Office online
offerings; and Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.      Office 365 Commercial is an
online services offering that includes Microsoft Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business, and is available across a variety of devices and platforms.      Microsoft Azure is a scalable cloud platform with computing, networking, storage, database, and management, along with advanced services such as analytics, and comprehensive solutions such as Enterprise Mobility
Suite. Microsoft Azure also includes a flexible platform that helps developers build, deploy, and manage enterprise, mobile, web, and IoT applications, for any platform or device without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Microsoft
Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software.   
  Dynamics CRM Online is designed to provide customer relationship management and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large
organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed.      Enterprise
Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and information
technology professionals on various Microsoft products.       Competition       Competitors to Office 365 Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Office Commercial.   
  Microsoft Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, VMware, and open source offerings.
Azure competes by enabling deployment of existing data centers with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and runs at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities.   
  Dynamics CRM Online primarily competes with Salesforce.com s on-demand CRM offerings.   
  The Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and
infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.   
   OPERATIONS       We have
operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the
European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno,
Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate data centers throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia.      To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions.
Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.

   We operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly
in Vietnam.      Our Xbox consoles, Surface, first-party video games, Microsoft PC accessories, and other hardware are primarily
manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements.   
   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT    
  During fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, research and development expense was $12.0 billion, $11.4 billion, and $10.4 billion, respectively.
These amounts represented 13% of revenue in each of those years. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts.       Product and Service Development and Intellectual Property       We develop most of our products and
services internally through three engineering groups.       

Applications and Services Engineering Group , focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, education,
search, and other information categories.          

Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group , focuses on development of our cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, enterprise resource planning,
management, development tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.          

Windows and Devices Engineering Group , focuses on our Windows platform across devices of all types, hardware development of our devices, including Xbox
consoles, Surface devices, Lumia phones, non-Lumia phones, Surface Hub, Microsoft Band, and other hardware products and accessories, and associated online marketplaces.      
  Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our
products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and
hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product
documentation internally.      We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and
internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing
patents and currently have a portfolio of over 57,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 35,000 pending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also
engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees  or Microsoft s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies
covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as
promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community.      While it may
be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable
terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.

    Investing in the Future       Microsoft s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and
product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the
company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms
spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, and devices operating systems and hardware.      While our main research and
development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel,
Japan, and the United Kingdom, among others. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that
we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated
with other segments and leveraged across the company.      In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate
Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing
us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation.       DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING
      We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs; distributors and resellers; online; and
Microsoft retail stores. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with enterprises and public sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their software requirements; managing OEM relationships; and
supporting solution integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products.   
   OEMs       We distribute software through OEMs
that pre-install our software on new PCs, tablets, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices that they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware
pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In addition to these products, we also market our services through OEMs and service bundles such as
Windows with Bing or Windows with Office 365 subscription.      There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest OEMs, many of which
operate globally, are referred to as  Direct OEMs,  as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all
of the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUSTeK, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs consists of lower-volume PC manufacturers (also called
 system builders ), which source their Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.   
   Distributors and Resellers       Many
organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us, with sales support from solution integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and developers that advise organizations on
licensing our products and services ( Enterprise Agreement Direct Advisors , or  EDAs ).

Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through license solutions partners ( LSPs ), distributors, value-added resellers ( VARs ), OEMs,
system builder channels, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small-sized and
medium-sized organizations. EDAs typically are also authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs, such as the Select Plus and Open licensing programs discussed under  Licensing Options  below. Some of our
distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include CDW, Dell, Insight Enterprises, and Software House International.      Our Microsoft Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged
products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets, including Microsoft retail stores. We distribute
our hardware products, including Surface, Xbox, phones, and PC accessories, through third-party retailers and Microsoft retail stores. Our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers. We have a network of field sales
representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers, and provides product training and sales support.   
   Online       Although on-premises software
continues to be an important part of our business, increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloud-based services. We provide online content services to consumers through Bing, MSN portals and channels, Office 365, Windows
Phone Store, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, OneDrive, Skype, and Windows Store. We also provide commercial cloud-based services such as Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Azure, and Office 365. Other services delivered online include our online advertising
platform with offerings for advertisers and publishers, as well as Microsoft Developer Network subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing
and selling our products and solutions. As we increasingly deliver online services, we sell many of these cloud-based services through our enterprise agreements and have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and medium-sized
businesses. These programs include direct sales, direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors, and resale of services through operator channels, such as telephone, cell, and cable providers.   
  We also sell our products through our Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces.   
   LICENSING OPTIONS       We
license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services. Our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them
with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. In delivering organizational licensing agreements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various
sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.       Customer Licensing Programs
       Open Licensing       Designed
primarily for small-to-medium organizations, the Open Programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and, at the customer s election, rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period (two or
three years depending on the Open Programs used). The offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period is called software assurance. Software assurance also provides support, tools, and training
to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. The Open Programs have several variations to fit customers  diverse ways of purchasing. Under the Open License Program, customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software
assurance, and/or renew software assurance upon the expiration   
         14

PART I       Item 1         
   
of other existing volume licensing agreements. Under the Open Value and Open Value Subscription programs, customers can acquire perpetual or subscription licenses, respectively, over a three-year
period. Online services are available in each of the Open Programs.       Microsoft Product and Services Agreement    
  Suited for medium-to-large organizations, the Microsoft Products and Services Agreement ( MPSA ) provides customers the ability to
purchase online services subscriptions, software licenses, software licenses with software assurance, and renewals of software assurance through a single agreement. Software assurance and online services subscriptions are generally available up
to three years.       Select Plus Licensing       Designed primarily for medium-to-large organizations, the Select Plus Program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer s election, software assurance over a specified time period
(generally three years or less). Similar to Open Programs, the Select Plus Program allows customers to acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with software assurance, or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing
agreements. A subset of online services are also available for purchase through the Select Plus Program, and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years. In July 2014, we announced that we would no longer sign new
Select Plus agreements with commercial organizations starting July 2015, and encouraged customers who want to purchase licenses to transition to the MPSA. We expect Select Plus business to transition to the MPSA within a few years.   
   Enterprise Agreement Licensing       Designed
primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations that want to acquire licenses to online services and/or software products, along with software assurance and obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across the organization.
Enterprises can elect to acquire perpetual licenses or, under the Enterprise Subscription option, can acquire non-perpetual, subscription licenses for a specified period (generally three years). Online services are also available for purchase
through the enterprise agreement and subscriptions are generally structured with three-year terms.       Customer Licensing Programs   Online
Services Only       Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed to enable small and medium-sized businesses to easily purchase
Microsoft Online Services. The program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.       Partner Programs
      The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program enables partners to directly manage their entire Microsoft cloud customer lifecycle.
Partners in this program use dedicated in-product tools to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. Partners can easily package their own tools, products, and services, and combine them into one monthly or annual
customer bill.      The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement is a program targeted at service providers and independent software
vendors allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Agreements are generally structured with a three-year term, and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption.   
  Microsoft Online Services Reseller Agreement is a program enabling partners to package Microsoft online services with the partners  services.
     Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program is a program that enables partners to use Microsoft software in their own software
programs.

      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    
  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.       We face intense competition across
all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.        Competition in the technology sector
      Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small,
specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly
with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to
businesses and consumers.       Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices    
  An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A
well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain
attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.       

A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded
with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some
vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services; however, our competitors in smartphones and tablets have established significantly larger user bases. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model will
increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.          

We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms
developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to
perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to
our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their
commitment to our platform.          

The success of the Windows Phone platform is an important element of our goal to enhance personal productivity in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. The
marketplace among mobile phone platforms is highly competitive. We may face issues in selecting, engaging, or securing support from operators and retailers for Windows phones due to, for instance, inadequate sales training or incentives, or
insufficient marketing support for the Windows Phone platform.          

Competing platforms have application marketplaces (sometimes referred to as  stores ) with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and
utility of applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users incur costs to move data and buy new applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write
applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors  application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.

    Business model competition       Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.       

Even as we transition to a mobile-first and cloud-first strategy, the license-based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue. We bear
the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to
businesses and consumers under this model.          

Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue
funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.      

Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and
earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality
of our products.         The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions,
and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.       Our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.     A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing
devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and
business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant
resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to
innovation. The Company s increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Besides software development
costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in
several areas, including:       

Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.      

Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones,
tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices.          

Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.      

Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.      

Making our suite of cloud-based services platform agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.
        It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are
not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure
and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.

    We make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected
returns.     We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system,
Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of
hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support,
and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably
affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating
margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.      The launch of Windows
10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a
positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10
in the marketplace may be harmed. In addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect
could have an adverse impact on our revenues.      Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing
periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.       Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.     We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and
strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our
investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a
party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling
new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we
expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.       If our goodwill or amortizable
intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.     We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which
could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least
annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash
flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable
intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous Online Services Division
business (Devices and Consumer Other under our current segment structure), and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible
assets in our Phone Hardware segment.

    We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.    
   We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights       Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on
revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of
harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual
property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.
      We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses       We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some
instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and
regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest
the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of
discovering infringements.       Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.     From
time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the
rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available,
stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek
injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the
validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may
continue to do so.       We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source
code.     Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to
several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may become easier
for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.

    Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or
harm to our competitive position.        Security of Microsoft s information technology    
  Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored
organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT. They may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, or act
in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have
cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business
applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in
theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.      In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and
customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.   
   Security of our products, services, devices, and customers  data       Security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our
cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including
many of ours, and we expect that to continue. The security of our products and services is important in our customers  purchasing decisions.      To defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve
the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that
protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.      The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers
to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional
products or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our
revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal
challenges. Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.       Disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.     As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly
large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve
the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our

training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure
could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store
and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for
transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could
inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our
flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.       We may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.     Our increasing user traffic, growth in services,
and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our
websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live,
Microsoft Azure, Outlook.com, Windows Stores, and Microsoft Account services. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and
expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or
operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and
other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.   
   Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our
products.     As a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law
activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state
antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.      The European Commission
( the Commission ) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other
companies. In 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary
Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commission s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking
to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the
Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could
hamper sales of our products.      Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a
large variety of devices on our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase.
Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently
implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.

   Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide
the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them,
could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:       

We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products
to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely.      

We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our
associated intellectual property.          

The rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings.      

We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we
fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions.          

Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.      
   Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and
regulations.     The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations ( Anti-Corruption Laws ) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive
inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies,
training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal
sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, and other
regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.
     Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data
storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often
unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments  approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Increasing
concern about government surveillance practices around the world may lead to increased regulation requiring local data hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant
costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions
and impact our ability to do business in some geographies.       Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented
employees.     Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to
recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely
affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.   
   We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.     We are subject to a variety of claims and
lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are

subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the
period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.       We may have additional tax
liabilities.     We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business,
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make
resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and
accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.   
  We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions
to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.
Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.       Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.     Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other
devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues
through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from
a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete
inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the
supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.   
  Our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs
and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new
products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.   
   Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.     Our customers are located in over 200 countries and
a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these
markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international
currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we
reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries.       Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt
our business.     A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing
services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other
business operations in the

Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems
could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and
magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.      Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and
armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may
cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or
changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may
increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.       Adverse
economic or market conditions may harm our business.     Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If
demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal
government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT
spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.      Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner
and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales
channel disruption.      Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they
have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.      We maintain an
investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A
significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default
on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our
financial results.         ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS    
  We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more
preceding the end of our fiscal year 2015 that remain unresolved.         ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
      The following Management s Discussion and Analysis ( MD A ) is intended to help the reader understand the
results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.
      OVERVIEW    
  Microsoft is a technology leader focused on building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We
strive to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We develop and market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people s lives.   
  We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including
cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are
related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and income taxes.   
  Much of our focus in fiscal year 2015 was toward transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and
productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support the three central ambitions that support our strategy:
reinventing productivity and business processes; building the intelligent cloud platform; and creating more personal computing.   
  Highlights from fiscal year 2015 included:       

Momentum continued to grow in our Commercial Cloud and productivity offerings as we surpassed an $8 billion annualized run rate* at the end of the year.

Office 365 Commercial seats grew 74%, and Office 365 is now deployed in four out of five Fortune 500 enterprises, with more than half of that install base
using premium workloads. We also added over 50,000 small- and medium-sized business customers each month.          

Server products and services revenue increased 9%, driven by growth across our cloud and on-premises server products. Azure revenue and compute usage
increased by triple digits in the fourth quarter year over year, and we ended fiscal year 2015 with more than 17,000 Enterprise Mobility Services customers.

*  
     Annualized run rate was calculated by multiplying June 2015 revenue by twelve months.       
         29

PART II       Item 7         

We reached over 8 million paid Dynamics seats and refreshed and enhanced Microsoft Dynamics ERP products. We also introduced new social, productivity,
mobility, customer service, and marketing capabilities in Dynamics CRM.          

We currently have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, with new customers signing up at a current pace of nearly one million per month.
We also surpassed 150 million downloads of Office mobile to iOS and Android devices.          

Bing exceeded 20% U.S. market share as we focused our advertising business on search. In June 2015, we entered into agreements with AOL and AppNexus to
outsource our display sales efforts.          

In hardware, we released Surface 3 and expanded distribution of Surface Pro and the related gross margin percentage grew with increased revenue, and
introduced new categories like HoloLens   all with an eye toward generating new growth in Windows more broadly.          

Xbox console volumes grew to over 12 million, and Xbox Live users increased 22%.      

We shipped over 36 million Lumia units, and announced the restructuring of our Phone Hardware business to run it more effectively near-term while driving
reinvention longer term.          

We completed 16 acquisitions, including Mojang Synergies AB ( Mojang ), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, and
others, to strengthen our cloud platform and invest in mobile applications.          

We advanced Windows 10 to the threshold of its launch in July 2015 with the help of the Windows Insider Program, a new paradigm to incorporate unprecedented
levels of user and developer feedback in our development process.          Industry Trends    
  Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an
opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that
seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.       Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
      The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new
software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the
user s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our
operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.      Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified
employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one s
career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
     Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Recently, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies has
negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.  
         30

PART II       Item 7         
   See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this
Form 10-K).       Seasonality       Our
revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Computing and
Gaming Hardware segment is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Computing and Gaming Hardware segment has generated approximately 40-50%
of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter.       Unearned Revenue       Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue, including:       

Revenue deferred on pre-sales of Windows to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and retailers before general availability.

Revenue deferred on bundled products and services ( Bundled Offerings ).      

Revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the  Windows Upgrade Offer ).
        If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing
transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.   
   Reportable Segments       The segment amounts
included in MD A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 22   Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of
this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ), along with certain corporate-level and other
activity, are included in Corporate and Other. Operating expenses are not allocated to our segments. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.
     On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation s ( Nokia ) Devices and Services business
( NDS ). NDS has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial
results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our Devices and Consumer ( D C ) Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the
acquisition.      Our reportable segments are described below.       Devices and Consumer       Our D C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products
and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D C segments are:

   SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        
     Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014       Revenue increased $6.7 billion or 8%, reflecting a full year of Phone Hardware sales and growth in revenue from our Commercial Cloud, Surface, server products, search advertising, and Xbox Live transactions. These
increases were offset in part by a decline in revenue from Office Commercial, Windows OEM, licensing of Windows Phone operating system, and Office Consumer. Revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%.   
  Gross margin increased $787 million or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.0 billion or 22% increase in cost of revenue.
Cost of revenue increased, mainly due to Phone Hardware, as well as increasing costs in support of our Commercial Cloud, including $396 million of higher datacenter expenses. Gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, improved year over year in each
of our reportable segments.   
         32

PART II       Item 7         
   Operating income decreased $9.6 billion or 35%, primarily due to impairment, integration, and
restructuring expenses in the current year, as well as increased research and development expenses, offset in part by higher gross margin. Key changes in operating expenses were:   

Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion in the current year, reflecting goodwill and asset impairment charges of $7.5 billion
related to our Phone Hardware business, and $2.5 billion of integration and restructuring expenses, driven by costs associated with our restructuring plans.      

Research and development expenses increased $665 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services, including NDS expenses,
offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses.         Diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) were negatively
impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which decreased diluted EPS by $1.15.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year
2013       Revenue increased $9.0 billion or 12%, demonstrating growth across our consumer and commercial businesses, primarily due to
higher revenue from server products, Xbox Platform, Commercial Cloud, and Surface. Revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud-based offerings.
     Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase in cost of
revenue. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface devices sold, and $575 million of higher datacenter expenses, primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of revenue also increased due to
the acquisition of NDS.      Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased
research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:       

Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services in our Devices engineering
group, including NDS expenses, and increased investment in our Applications and Services engineering group.          

Sales and marketing expenses increased $535 million or 4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased investment in sales resources, offset in part by lower
advertising costs.

which concluded in conjunction with the acquisition of NDS, as well as an increase in phone patent licensing revenue. Retail and non-OEM sales of Windows declined $274 million or 35%, mainly due
to the launch of Windows 8 in the prior year. Windows OEM revenue declined $136 million or 1%, due to continued softness in the consumer PC market, offset in part by a 12% increase in OEM Pro revenue. Office Consumer revenue declined $249
million or 7%, reflecting the transition of customers to Office 365 Consumer as well as continued softness in the consumer PC market. The declines in Windows OEM and Office Consumer revenue were partially offset by benefits realized from ending our
support for Windows XP in April 2014.      D C Licensing gross margin increased $454 million or 3%, primarily due to a $353 million or
14% decrease in cost of revenue. D C Licensing cost of revenue decreased, mainly due to a $411 million or 23% decline in traffic acquisition costs.   
   Computing and Gaming Hardware       Computing
and Gaming Hardware revenue increased $2.9 billion or 48%, primarily due to higher revenue from the Xbox Platform and Surface. Xbox Platform revenue increased $1.7 billion or 34%, mainly due to sales of Xbox One, which was released in November 2013,

   Commercial Licensing       Commercial Licensing
revenue decreased $1.0 billion or 2%, primarily due to a decline in revenue from Office Commercial, offset in part by increased revenue from our server products. Commercial Licensing revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of
approximately 2%. Office Commercial revenue declined $2.5 billion or 13%, due to lower transactional license volume, reflecting a decline in the business PC market following Windows XP end of support in the prior year, customers transitioning to
Office 365 Commercial, and declines in Japan. Our server products revenue grew $1.1 billion or 7%, primarily driven by higher premium mix of Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, and System Center.   
  Commercial Licensing gross margin decreased $785 million or 2%, in line with revenue.       Commercial Other       Commercial Other revenue increased $3.3 billion or 44%, primarily due to
higher Commercial Cloud revenue. Commercial Other revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 3%. Commercial Cloud revenue grew $3.0 billion or 106%, mainly due to subscriber growth and higher premium mix of Office 365
Commercial, as well as continued revenue growth from Microsoft Azure.      Commercial Other gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 126%, due
to higher revenue, offset in part by a $946 million or 17% increase in cost of revenue. The increase in Commercial Other cost of revenue was mainly due to higher datacenter and other online infrastructure expenses, reflecting increased datacenter
capacity to serve our growing Commercial Cloud.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013    
  Commercial revenue increased $4.2 billion or 9%, mainly due to growth in revenue from our on-premises licensing businesses and Commercial Cloud.
Collectively, Office Commercial and Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 7%. Collectively, our server products revenue, including Microsoft Azure, grew 13%. Commercial gross margin increased $3.3 billion or 9%, in line with revenue.

    Commercial Licensing       Commercial Licensing revenue increased $2.3 billion or 6%, primarily due to increased revenue from our server products, as well as higher revenue from Windows Commercial and Office Commercial. Our server
products revenue grew $1.7 billion or 11%, driven primarily by increased sales of Microsoft SQL Server. Windows Commercial revenue grew $334 million or 10%, mainly due to increased renewal rates and transactional purchases driven by Windows XP end
of support. Office Commercial revenue grew $219 million or 1%, and was impacted by customers transitioning to Office 365 Commercial.   
  Commercial Licensing gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 6%, in line with revenue growth.   
   Commercial Other       Commercial Other revenue
increased $1.9 billion or 33%, due to higher Commercial Cloud revenue and Enterprise Services revenue. Commercial Cloud revenue grew $1.5 billion or 116%, mainly due to higher revenue from Office 365 Commercial. Enterprise Services revenue grew $380
million or 9%, mainly due to growth in Premier Support Services.      Commercial Other gross margin increased $933 million or 101%, due to
higher revenue, offset in part by a $952 million or 20% increase in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue was mainly due to higher datacenter expenses, reflecting support of our growing Commercial Cloud.   
   Corporate and Other        
    Corporate and Other revenue comprises certain revenue deferrals, including those related to product and service
upgrade offers and pre-sales of new products to OEMs prior to general availability.       Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014    
  Corporate and Other revenue increased $619 million, primarily due to the timing of revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. During fiscal year
2015, we recognized a net $303 million of previously deferred revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During fiscal year 2014, we deferred a net $349 million of revenue related to Bundled Offerings.   
  Corporate and Other gross margin increased $625 million, primarily due to increased revenue.   
   Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013       Corporate and Other revenue decreased $818 million, primarily due to the timing of revenue deferrals. During fiscal year 2014, we deferred a net $349 million of revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During fiscal
year 2013, we recognized $540 million of previously deferred revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. The revenue was recognized upon expiration of the offer.      Corporate and Other gross margin decreased $863 million, mainly due to decreased revenue.

    OPERATING EXPENSES        Research and Development        
    Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the
amortization of purchased software code.       Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014    
  Research and development expenses increased $665 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services, including $739
million higher NDS expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013    
  Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services in our Devices
engineering group, including $275 million of NDS expenses, and increased investment in our Applications and Services engineering group.       Sales and
Marketing        
    Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.       Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014       Sales and marketing expenses decreased $98
million or 1%, primarily due to a decline in advertising and marketing programs costs and a reduction in headcount-related expenses, offset in part by an increase in NDS expenses. Sales and marketing expenses included a favorable foreign currency
impact of approximately 4%.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013    
  Sales and marketing expenses increased $535 million or 4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased investment in sales resources, offset in
part by lower advertising costs. NDS sales and marketing expenses were $394 million during fiscal year 2014. Average headcount, excluding NDS, grew 4%. Advertising costs, excluding NDS, declined $403 million or 15%, primarily due to Windows 8 and
Surface costs in the prior year.

    General and Administrative    
   
    General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance
expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees.   
   Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014       General and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year
2013       General and administrative expenses decreased $336 million or 7%, mainly due to the European Commission fine in the prior
year, offset in part by higher business taxes, higher costs for internal use software capitalized in the prior year, and NDS expenses. NDS general and administrative expenses were $77 million during fiscal year 2014.   
   IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES       Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses include costs associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our Phone Hardware business, employee severance expenses and costs
associated with the consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities, and systems consolidation and other business integration expenses associated with our acquisition of NDS.   
   Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014       Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion for fiscal year 2015, compared to $127 million for fiscal year 2014. The increase was mainly due to impairment charges of $7.5 billion related
to our Phone Hardware business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of Phone Hardware goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we
recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing Phone Hardware s goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of
Phone Hardware intangible assets. Restructuring charges were $2.1 billion, including employee severance expenses and the write-down of certain assets in connection with our restructuring activities. Integration expenses increased $308 million, due
to a full-year of integration activities in fiscal year 2015 associated with the acquisition of NDS.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
      Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $127 million for fiscal year 2014, reflecting integration expenses
associated with the acquisition of NDS. No impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were recorded in fiscal year 2013.

    OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET    
  The components of other income (expense), net were as follows:       
    We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and
credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those
derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on certain balance
sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes.       Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014    
  Dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on fixed income securities, offset in part by higher portfolio balances. Interest
expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary
impairments were $183 million in fiscal year 2015, compared with $106 million in fiscal year 2014. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity contracts in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period, offset in
part by lower losses on currency and equity contracts. For fiscal year 2015, other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013       Dividends and interest income increased due
to higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities and lower other-than-temporary impairments.
Other-than-temporary impairments were $106 million in fiscal year 2014, compared with $208 million in fiscal year 2013. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts, losses on equity derivatives as compared
to gains in the prior period, offset in part by gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period. For fiscal year 2014, other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures, offset in part by a
recognized gain on a divestiture. For fiscal year 2013, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture.   
   INCOME TAXES        Fiscal year 2015 compared
with fiscal year 2014       Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was approximately 34% and 21%, respectively. The fiscal
year 2015 effective rate increased by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015,
this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.

   Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also
impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional
operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and
$7.1 billion, respectively, and comprised 40% and 26%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 60% and
74%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.      Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $12.1 billion and $10.4
billion as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years  liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to
our IRS audits. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and
reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our
allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available,
we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2015.   
  We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years 1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013       Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014
and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our
products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.      Our fiscal year 2014
effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to prior years  liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses
incurred by NDS and changes in the geographic mix of our business. This was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily Denmark.   
  Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted
primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft
Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. Windows PC operating system revenue decreased $655 million in fiscal year 2014, while Microsoft Office system and server products and tools
revenue increased $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, during this same period. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 26% and 25%, respectively, of
our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and 75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.   
   FINANCIAL CONDITION        Cash, Cash
Equivalents, and Investments       Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $96.5 billion as of June 30, 2015,
compared with $85.7 billion as of June 30, 2014. Equity and other investments were $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2015, compared with $14.6 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity

preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S.
dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our
fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid
investment-grade fixed-income securities.      Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 30, 2015, $94.4
billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of
funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.1 billion. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 79% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency
securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.   
   Securities lending       We lend certain
fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount
determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $92 million as of June 30, 2015. Our
average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $287 million and $750 million, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
      Valuation       In general, and
where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds,
domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or
inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and
asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.      A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors
and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a
quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as
Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the
fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of
period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

    Cash Flows    
   Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014       Cash flows from operations decreased $3.2 billion during the fiscal year to $29.1 billion, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to
restructuring charges and other changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $686 million to $9.1 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in cash used for common
stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment
purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets.       Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013       Cash flows from operations increased $3.4
billion during fiscal year 2014 to $32.2 billion, mainly due to increases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock
repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in
investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and
purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment.       Debt    
  We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate
environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of
existing debt. See Note 12   Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.       Unearned
Revenue       Unearned revenue at June 30, 2015 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned
revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with
revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2015 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox Live subscriptions and prepaid points;
Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Office 365 subscriptions; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or
software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.      The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned
revenue as of June 30, 2015:

    Share Repurchases       On September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013,
has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. While the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by December 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2015, $21.9 billion remained of our $40.0
billion share repurchase program.      During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 295 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $13.2
billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175 million shares for $6.4 billion; 128 million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion
under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013, and 47 million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and
expired September 30, 2013. During fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 158 million shares for $4.6 billion, under the share repurchase program announced on September 22, 2008. All repurchases were made using cash resources.

Stockholders  Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.       Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements       We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our
ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.       Contractual Obligations       The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for
our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2015:

    Other Planned Uses of Capital       We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy.
Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in
coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with
unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.   
   Liquidity       We earn a significant amount of
our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital
markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the
next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities
and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.      Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could
elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We
have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.       RECENT ACCOUNTING
GUIDANCE       See Note 1   Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further
discussion.       APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of
investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.       Revenue Recognition    
  Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted
for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.      Judgment is also required to assess whether
future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future
versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.   
         46

   Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the
definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support ( PCS ) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is
deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.   
  Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over
different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a
hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price
( ESP ). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price
established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables
were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.   
  In January 2015, we announced Windows 10 will be free to all qualified existing users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This offer differs from
historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of Windows as it is being made available for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. We evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the Windows 10
offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. As this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of Windows
8 will continue to be recognized as delivered.       Impairment of Investment Securities    
  We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this
judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among
other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For
fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial
health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment
charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.   
   Goodwill       We allocate goodwill to reporting
units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair
value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant
portion of a reporting unit.      Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting
units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a
  
         47

PART II       Item 7         
   
discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term
rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.      The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could
materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.      Based on the results of our annual
goodwill impairment testing as of May 1, 2015, we determined that goodwill associated with our Phone Hardware reporting unit was impaired, resulting in a material charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. As of June 30,
2015, none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of impairment.       Research and Development Costs    
  Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been
established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a
product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products
are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.       Legal and
Other Contingencies       The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An
estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In
determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact
our consolidated financial statements.       Income Taxes       The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax
positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax
consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

    Inventories       Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review
inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels,
pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated
volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.

    STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
  Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report.
The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   
  The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an
organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.      The Company engaged Deloitte   Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).      The Board of Directors,
through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities
and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte   Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

      ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK        RISKS       We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial
statements.       Foreign Currency    
  Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and
use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
      Interest Rate       Our fixed-income
portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain
global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use  To Be Announced  forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.   
   Equity       Our equity portfolio consists of
global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.
      Commodity       We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global
commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.       VALUE-AT-RISK    
  We use a value-at-risk ( VaR ) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level,
in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange
rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.      The VaR is calculated as the total loss
that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and
legal risk.

   The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of
June 30, 2015 and 2014 and for the year ended June 30, 2015:       
    Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $237 million at June 30, 2015 and $333 million at
June 30, 2014. The total VaR is 29% less at June 30, 2015, and 25% less at June 30, 2014, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.

      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
    NOTE 1   ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
    Accounting Principles    
  The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).      We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation,
with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.       Principles of Consolidation    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee s activities are accounted for using the equity
method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.   
   Estimates and Assumptions       Preparing
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of,
and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangibles assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of
our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological
feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are
other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates and assumptions.       Foreign Currencies    
  Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income ( OCI ).       Revenue Recognition       Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
     Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can
be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.      Microsoft enters into
arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their
relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value ( VSOE ), (ii) third-party evidence,   
         58   

Table of Contents  

PART II       Item 8         
   
and (iii) best estimate of selling price ( ESP ). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing
fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the
marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary
over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.      Revenue for retail packaged products, products
licensed to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.   
  Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to
use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is
deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when
the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.      Software updates
that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the
upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support ( PCS ) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and
recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.   
  Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions
of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements
that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.
     Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually
determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made
available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such
resources.      Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are
accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue
recognition timing.      Revenue related to phones, Surface devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is
generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with
software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.   
  Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the
search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been   
         59

PART II       Item 8         
   
completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during
the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of
the software or services.       Cost of Revenue       Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to
include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs;
inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the
products.       Product Warranty       We
provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure
rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally
include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate
our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.       Research and Development
      Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related
expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of
purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally
shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.   
   Sales and Marketing       Sales and marketing
expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.       Stock-Based Compensation       We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on
the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.   
         60   

Table of Contents  

PART II       Item 8         
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan       Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock
purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.       Income Taxes
      Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such
temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The deferred income taxes are classified as current or
long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.       Fair Value Measurements    
  We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which
inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
These levels are:       

Level 1    inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative
investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.

Level 2    inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and
forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities,
and foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.          

Level 3    inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and
preferred stock and goodwill when it is recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. Our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities
primarily include equity derivatives.         We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market
prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.   
  Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.   
         61   

Table of Contents  

PART II       Item 8         
    Financial Instruments       We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying
values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as
short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and
realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI.      Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. With the exception of certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity
securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI. Held-to-maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity
method.      We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried
as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is
recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.      Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged
to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and
qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and
extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more
likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes
in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is
established.      Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.      For derivative
instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair
value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.      For
derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from
the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.      For derivative instruments that are not designated
as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment

purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a
component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) into other income (expense), net.   
   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts       The
allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:       
     Inventories    
  Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related
to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below
carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.
      Property and Equipment    
  Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset
or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements,
five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.       Goodwill
      Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an
annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.   
   Intangible Assets       All of our intangible
assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events
or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

    Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted    
  In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that
reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.   
    NOTE 2   EARNINGS PER SHARE    
   Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive
potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.      The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:
      
    Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods
presented.

Table of Contents  

PART II       Item 8         

    In addition to the investments in the table above, we also own corporate notes that are classified as
held-to-maturity investments, which are included in equity and other investments on the balance sheet. These corporate notes are due October 31, 2023 and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of June 30, 2015, the
amortized cost and recorded basis of these corporate notes were both $25 million with an estimated fair value that approximates the carrying value. As of June 30, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these
corporate notes was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164 million.      As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $561 million and $520 million, respectively. These
investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.   
  We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the
creditworthiness of the borrower. As of June 30, 2015, collateral received under these agreements totaled $92 million which is comprised of $79 million of certificates of deposit and $13 million of U.S. government and agency securities. The
contractual maturities of these agreements are primarily on a continuous and overnight basis.

    Unrealized Losses on Investments       Investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:   

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized
losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of
June 30, 2015.       Debt Investment Maturities        
 
    NOTE 5   DERIVATIVES    
   We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.   
  Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented
below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.

Table of Contents  

PART II       Item 8         
    Foreign Currency       Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge
positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese
yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $9.8 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.   
  Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are
designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively.   
  Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain
balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. As of
June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.   
   Equity       Securities held in our equity and
other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not
designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts
of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2014, the total
notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.   
   Interest Rate       Securities held in our
fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using
exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and
sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.7 billion and $936 million, respectively.   
  In addition, we use  To Be Announced  forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the total notional derivative amounts of
mortgage contracts purchased were $812 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.       Credit    
  Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not
designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or
groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased
and sold were $550 million and $440 million, respectively.

PART II       Item 8         
    Commodity       We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and
manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As
of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and $316 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4
billion and $408 million, respectively.       Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features    
  Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured
debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2015, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

     Cash Flow Hedge Gains (Losses)       We recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the periods presented):   
   
    We estimate that $492 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2015 will be reclassified
into earnings within the following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2015.   
   Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses)    
  Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense),
net. These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those
derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) from foreign
exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet amounts.

    NOTE 9   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS    
    Mojang Synergies AB       On
November 6, 2014, we acquired Mojang Synergies AB ( Mojang ), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our
gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. Our purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and
liabilities becomes available, including additional information relating to tax matters and finalization of our valuation of identified intangible assets.      The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928 million, primarily marketing-related
(trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Devices and
Consumer ( D C ) Other segment. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date.
      Nokia s Devices and Services Business       On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation s ( Nokia ) Devices and Services business ( NDS ) for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash
acquired of $1.5 billion (the  Acquisition ). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction, and liabilities assumed of
$0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected to accelerate the growth of our D C business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.      The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of March 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:   

(a)  
     Gross accounts receivable was $901 million, of which $147 million was expected to be uncollectible.       

(b)  
     Goodwill was assigned to our Phone Hardware segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that were expected to be achieved from
the integration of NDS.

   Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:
      
    During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset impairment charges
related to our Phone Hardware business. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement. See Note 10   Goodwill and Note 11   Intangible Assets for additional details.
     Our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million,
respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.      Following are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation
on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been consummated on July 1, 2012:       
    These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the
results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily
related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.   
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs
are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income
statement for fiscal year 2014.      Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the
Acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market
value. In addition, we agreed to license Nokia s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered.       Yammer       On July 18, 2012, we acquired Yammer, Inc. ( Yammer ), a leading
provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. Yammer added an enterprise social networking service to Microsoft s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. The major classes of assets to which we allocated the
purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. We assigned the goodwill to Commercial Other under our current segment structure. Yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the
acquisition date.

    Other       During fiscal year 2015, we completed 15 additional acquisitions for total cash consideration of $892 million. These entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective
acquisition dates.      Pro forma results of operations for Mojang and our other acquisitions during the current period have not been
presented because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.   
    NOTE 10   GOODWILL    
   Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:   

(a)  
     Goodwill acquired during fiscal year 2014 related to the acquisition of NDS. See Note 9   Business Combinations for additional details. 
        The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on
the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in
which the acquisitions occurred.      Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase
accounting adjustments are presented as  Other  in the above table. Also included in  Other  are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal year 2015, a $5.1
billion goodwill impairment charge was included in  Other,  as discussed further below. This goodwill impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected
in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note 22   Segment Information and Geographic Data.      Our accumulated goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $11.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.   
         76   

Table of Contents  

PART II       Item 8         
    Goodwill Impairment       We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe
use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.      Upon completion of the
annual testing as of May 1, 2015, Phone Hardware goodwill was determined to be impaired. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than
planned. These results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of
these changes in strategy and expectations, we have forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an
impairment adjustment was required.      Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware s carrying value exceeded its estimated
fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test ( Step 2 ) was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing
technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of
the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets.
     No other instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test. No impairment of goodwill was identified as of
May 1, 2014.   
    NOTE 11   INTANGIBLE ASSETS    
   The components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:   

(a)  
     Technology-based intangible assets included $116 million and $98 million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of net carrying amount of
software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.          We estimate that we have no significant residual value
related to our intangible assets. During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to our Phone Hardware intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested the intangible assets for recoverability
due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets
was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine
the amount of impairment. These intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income
(loss) by segment group in Note 22   Segment Information and Geographic Data. No material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 2014.

    The table above includes $4.5 billion related to the acquisition of NDS during fiscal year 2014, of which $2.2
billion was impaired in fiscal year 2015. See Note 9   Business Combination for additional details.      Intangible assets amortization
expense was $1.3 billion, $845 million, and $739 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software was $79 million, $200 million, and $210 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
     The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at June 30, 2015:

NOTE 12   DEBT    
    Short-term Debt       As of
June 30, 2015, we had $5.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from 8 days to 63 days. As of June 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper
issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 to 91 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.   
  We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on November 4, 2015 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These credit facilities
serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2015, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented.   
   Long-term Debt       As of June 30, 2015,
the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $30.3 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt of $20.6
billion and $21.5 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

         80   

Table of Contents  

PART II       Item 8         
   The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower
rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign
jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges. Excluding these losses, our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and are generated from our
regional operating centers, were 73%, 81%, and 79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years
2015, 2014, and 2013, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.      The components of the deferred income tax assets
and liabilities were as follows:       
    As of June 30, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $4.6 billion, including $1.8 billion of
foreign net operating loss carryforwards acquired through our acquisition of Skype, and $545 million through our acquisition of NDS. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and
other future deductible net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.      Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.   
  As of June 30, 2015, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately
$108.3 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are   
         81

PART II       Item 8         
   
permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $34.5 billion at June 30, 2015.   
  Income taxes paid were $4.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $3.9 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.   
   Uncertain Tax Positions       Unrecognized tax
benefits as of June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $9.6 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, by $7.9 billion, $7.0
billion, and $6.5 billion, respectively.      As of June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain
tax positions of $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $237 million, $235 million, and $400 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively, and was included in income tax expense.      The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as
follows:       
    During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years
2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit
phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not
anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2015.   
  We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years 1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.   
    NOTE 14   RESTRUCTURING CHARGES    
    Phone Hardware Integration       In July 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align NDS with our company s overall strategy (the  Phone Hardware Integration Plan ). Pursuant to the Phone Hardware
Integration Plan, we eliminated approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were
completed as of June 30, 2015.   
         82

PART II       Item 8         
   In connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.3
billion during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets.       Phone Hardware Restructuring       In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our
Phone Hardware business to better focus and align resources (the  Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan ), under which we will eliminate up to 7,800 positions in fiscal year 2016. In connection with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, we
recorded restructuring charges of $780 million during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily related to contractual obligations. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan are
expected to be completed as of June 30, 2016.      Restructuring charges associated with each plan were included in impairment,
integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note 22   Segment Information and Geographic Data.   
  Changes in the restructuring liability were as follows:

    Construction and Operating Leases       We have committed $681 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of June 30, 2015.      We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities
operating leases was $989 million, $874 million, and $711 million, in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of June 30, 2015 are as

     Indemnifications       We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.
We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered
significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements.   
    NOTE 18   CONTINGENCIES    
    Patent and Intellectual Property Claims    
   Motorola litigation       In October 2010,
Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola Mobility ( Motorola ) with the International Trade Commission ( ITC ) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by
Motorola s Android devices. Microsoft and Motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the ITC, in federal district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany. The nature of the claims
asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.       International Trade Commission    
  In 2012, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order against Motorola on one Microsoft patent, which was affirmed on appeal. In 2013, Microsoft filed
an action in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the ITC s 2012 import ban against infringing Motorola products by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), after learning that
CBP had failed to fully enforce the order.      In 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft with the ITC alleging infringement of
five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing   
         84

PART II       Item 8         
   
Xbox products. At Motorola s request, the ITC terminated its investigation of four Motorola patents. In 2013, the ITC affirmed there was no violation of the remaining Motorola patent.
Motorola appealed the ITC s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.       U.S. District Court    
  The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to Microsoft s ITC case against Motorola was stayed pending
the outcome of the ITC case.      In November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U.S. District Court in Seattle,
alleging that Motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory ( RAND ) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential to
the implementation of the H.264 video standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In the Motorola ITC case described above and in suits described below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U.S. District
Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In 2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling that (1) Motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on RAND
terms and conditions; and (2) Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the Seattle District Court set per unit royalties for Motorola s H.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial Microsoft
liability. In 2013, following trial of Microsoft s breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to Microsoft. Motorola appealed with respect to both the Court s determination of royalties due Motorola and the
jury s award of damages against Motorola; in July 2015 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court s judgment in all respects.      Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one case in Wisconsin initially stayed and later dismissed without prejudice (a companion case to Motorola s ITC action),
have been transferred to the U.S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. The court has stayed these cases in Seattle on agreement of the parties.   

In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by a range of Microsoft products including mobile and PC operating system, productivity,
server, communication, browser and gaming products.          

In the Motorola action originally filed in California, Motorola asserts Microsoft violated antitrust laws in connection with Microsoft s assertion of
patents against Motorola that Microsoft agreed to license to certain qualifying entities on RAND terms and conditions.          

In counterclaims, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola digital video recorders.
         Germany       In
2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries.       

Motorola asserts two patents (both now expired) are essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products
including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet Explorer infringe those patents. In 2012, the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable Microsoft products in Germany, which Microsoft appealed. Orders in the litigation
pending in Seattle, Washington described above enjoin Motorola from enforcing the German injunction.          

Motorola asserts that one patent covers certain syncing functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by Windows Phone 7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile,
Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. In 2013, the court stayed the case pending the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft is seeking to invalidate the patent. In 2013, the Federal Patent Court invalidated the originally
issued patent claims, but ruled that certain new amended claims were patentable. Both Motorola and Microsoft appealed. In June 2014, the court reopened infringement proceedings, which are currently stayed.      

Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any injunction by altering its products to avoid Motorola s infringement claims.

Any damages would be determined in separate proceedings.

PART II       Item 8         
   In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft asserts that Motorola Android
devices infringe Microsoft patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in Germany issued injunctions on three of the Microsoft patents, which Motorola appealed. One judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and Motorola has
further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending (in one of these two cases the asserted patent has expired). An additional infringement proceeding is still pending in the court of first instance. In actions filed separately by Motorola to
invalidate these patents, the Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014 held the Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft appealed. For the cases in which Microsoft obtained injunctions, if Motorola were to prevail following all appeals, Motorola could
have a claim against Microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction.       IPCom patent litigation    
  IPCom GmbH   Co. ( IPCom ) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about
170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered
into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions.   
   InterDigital patent litigation    
  InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively,  IDT ) filed four patent infringement
cases against Nokia in the ITC and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of
the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT is seeking an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the
U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. The ITC issued a finding of no violation relating to two of the investigations, which IDT appealed. In February 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit affirmed one of the ITC s findings; the other has been stayed. In the third ITC action the administrative law judge ( ALJ ) issued a determination finding: (1) infringement; (2) evidence of  reverse
hold-up;  and (3) the public interest does not preclude issuance of an exclusion order. The ITC is reviewing the ALJ s initial determination. The trial in the Delaware case is scheduled for November 2015.   
   European copyright levies       We assumed from
Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia s alleged failure to pay  private copying levies  in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are based upon
a 2001 European Union ( EU ) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to
compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include
blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these
countries. Since April 2015, we and other major manufacturers have been engaged in settlement negotiations with the German collecting society, with the aim of concluding negotiations by October 2015.   
   Other patent and intellectual property claims       In addition to these cases, there are approximately 70 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft.

PART II       Item 8         
    Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions    
  A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on
behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005.      We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the U.S. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of
platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending
on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. We estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $200 million, all of which
had been accrued as of June 30, 2015.      Three similar cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been
settled. In 2010, the court in the British Columbia case certified it as a class action. After the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the case, in 2013 the Canadian Supreme Court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the
British Columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in 2016. The other two cases are inactive.       Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims
       GO Computer litigation       In
June 2005, GO Computer Inc. and co-founder Jerry Kaplan filed a complaint in California state court asserting antitrust claims under the Cartwright Act related to the business of the former GO Corporation in the early 1990s and its successor in
interest, Lucent Corporation in the early 2000s. All claims prior to June 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. The case is moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for September 2015.   
   China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigatio n         In July 2014, Microsoft was informed that China s State Administration for Industry and Commerce ( SAIC ) had begun a formal investigation relating to China s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC
conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification issues related to Windows and Office software.
      Product-Related Litigation        U.S. cell phone
litigation       Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior
Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS
acquisition and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines ( FCC Guidelines ) are pre-empted
by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and
testing around emission guidelines.      In September 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs  expert
evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In March 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to

preclude plaintiffs  general causation testimony. In August 2014, the court granted in part defendants  motion to exclude plaintiffs  general causation experts. The plaintiffs
filed an interlocutory appeal. In December 2014, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to hear  en banc  defendants  interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. Trial court
proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the appeal.       Canadian cell phone class action    
  Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of
British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia
defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.       Other    
  We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management
currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of
these matters may change in the future.      As of June 30, 2015, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $614 million in other
current liabilities and $20 million in other long-term liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably
possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

savings plan in the U.S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 75% of their salary, but not more than
statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the given
year. Matching contributions for all plans were $454 million, $420 million, and $393 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions in the U.S. plan are invested proportionate to
each participant s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested
in Microsoft common stock.   
    NOTE 22   SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA    
   In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company s Chief Executive
Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segment information in this note is reported on that basis. During the periods presented,
we reported our financial performance based on the following segments; D C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, D C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other.   
  On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note 9   Business Combinations for additional details. NDS has been included
in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic
initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.   
  Our reportable segments are described below.   
   Devices and Consumer       Our D C segments
develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with
audiences. Our D C segments are:       

D C Licensing , comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing ( Windows OEM ) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume
licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers ( Office Consumer  Windows Phone operating system, including related patent
licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue.

Office 365 Commercial, other Microsoft Office online offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure; and certain other commercial products and online services not included in the categories above.      
  Revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. Certain revenue contracts are allocated among the segments based on
the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware
segments. For the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology.      We do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, Devices and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of
expenses are made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether
on-premises or in the cloud.      Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows:   

Sales and marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment.      

Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where
the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group.          

General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin.      
  Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segment groups, including costs of: legal, including expenses, settlements, and fines;
information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.

    Corporate and Other operating income includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to U.S. GAAP,
corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment, and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue recognition, income statement
classification, and depreciation.      Corporate and Other activity was as follows:   

(a)  
     Corporate is presented on the basis of our internal accounting policies and excludes the adjustments to U.S. GAAP that are presented separately in those
line items.       

(b)  
     Corporate for fiscal year 2015 included impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses of $10.0 billion.       

(c)  
     Revenue reconciling amounts for fiscal year 2015 included a net $303 million of previously deferred net revenue related to sales of bundled products and
services ( Bundled Offerings ). Revenue reconciling amounts for fiscal year 2014 included a net $349 million of revenue deferrals related to Bundled Offerings. Revenue reconciling amounts for fiscal year 2013 included the recognition of
$540 million of revenue previously deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price.          No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2015, 2014, or 2013 revenue. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our
customers are located, was as follows:       

(a)  
     Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the
geographic source of the revenue.       
         95

    Our total Commercial Cloud revenue was $5.8 billion, $2.8 billion, and $1.3 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively. These amounts are included in their respective product categories in the table above.      Assets are not allocated to
segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is charged to the respective segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included
in the measure of segment profit or loss.      Long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets, classified by the location
of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows:

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation      Redmond, Washington      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders  equity for each of the three years in the period
ended June 30, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.      We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015, based on the criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework
(2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 31, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   
     REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING    
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal
control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial
statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets
that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.      Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2015. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte   Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015; their report is
included in Item 9A.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation      Redmond, Washington      We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft
Corporation and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of June 30, 2015, based on criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.   
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.      A company s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of
directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.      Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.      In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015, based on the criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
     We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2015, of the Company and our report dated July 31, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

  MICROSOFT CORPORATION   
  DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR   
  NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS   
  (Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2015)   
 1.  Purpose     The purpose of the Microsoft
Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the  Plan ) is to further the long-term growth of Microsoft Corporation (the  Company ) by allowing the non-employee directors of the Company the opportunity to
defer certain compensation, keeping their financial interests aligned with the Company, and providing them with a long-term incentive to continue providing services to the Company.  
 This Plan is intended to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) and official
guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with this intention.  
 2.  Effective Date     The Plan is effective
January 16, 2006. This restatement of the Plan is effective January 1, 2015.    3.  Definitions   
 In addition to the terms defined above, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated below.

under the Plan, which may include sub-accounts for amounts payable at different times and/or payable in different forms.     Affiliate

Retainer. For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Compensation earned in a Plan Year refers to the Cash Retainer and Equity Retainer earned in the four quarterly cycles beginning in the applicable Plan Year measured from the date of the annual
shareholders meeting in the immediately prior Plan Year.     Equity Retainer    means the amount of annual retainer payable in
Common Stock for service on the Board, including any annual retainer payable for service as a chair or member of any Board committee.  
      1  

New Director    means a Director who was not eligible to participate in the Plan (or
any other plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, which may be aggregated with the Plan under Code section 409A) prior to becoming a Director; provided, all Directors providing services to the Company as of the Effective Date shall be deemed
to be New Directors for purposes of making an initial election pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii) with respect to Eligible Compensation earned in 2006.  
  Open Enrollment    means the period during each Plan Year when Directors may elect to make, terminate or change an initial election
to defer amounts under the Plan. Open Enrollment shall normally be held during the month of December of each Plan Year.     Participant

means the senior corporate officer in charge of the Human Resources department, currently the Chief People Officer.    4.  Participation   
 4.1 Any Director shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. A Director becomes a Participant in the Plan on the date he or she first
enrolls in the Plan by electing to defer Eligible Compensation in accordance with Section 5.1(b).    4.2 A Director who has been a
Participant under the Plan will cease to be a Participant on the date his or her Account is fully distributed.    5.  Participant Accounts   
 5.1  Elections to Defer Eligible Compensation   
 (a)  Initial Deferral Election . A Director may make an irrevocable election to defer the following types of Eligible Compensation in one
(1) percent increments up to the specified maximum percentages:    (i) A Director may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her Cash
Retainer.    (ii) A Director may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her Equity Retainer.  
 (b)  Time and Manner of Making an Initial Election   
 (i) A Director may make an irrevocable election to defer one or more types of Eligible Compensation during the Open Enrollment period that
occurs in the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Eligible Compensation is earned.    (ii) In addition to Open Enrollment
elections under Section 5.1(b)(i), a New Director may make an irrevocable election to defer one or more types of Eligible Compensation, provided such election is made within thirty (30) days of becoming a New Director and such election
shall only apply to amounts earned after the election is filed.  
      2  

(iii) A deferral election shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Plan
Administrator.    (c)  Evergreen Election . An initial deferral election shall be effective for succeeding Plan Years and shall become
irrevocable on each December 31 with respect to Eligible Compensation earned in the immediately following Plan Year unless the Participant terminates or modifies such election. A Participant may terminate or modify an initial deferral election
during the Open Enrollment period immediately prior to the applicable Plan Year. Any termination of, or modification to, an initial deferral election shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator.  
 5.2  Crediting of Deferrals . Eligible Compensation deferred by a Participant under the Plan shall be credited to the Participant s
Account as soon as practicable after the amounts would have otherwise been paid to the Participant. Amounts credited to a Participant s Account shall be deemed immediately invested in shares of Common Stock (calculated to one one-thousandth of
a share). Any dividends which would have been received had such amount actually been invested in shares of Common Stock will also be credited to the Participant s Account and deemed immediately invested in additional shares of Common Stock
(calculated to one one-thousandth of a share). Nothing in this Section or otherwise in the Plan, however, will require the Company to actually invest any amounts credited to a Participant s Account in shares of Common Stock or otherwise.  
 5.3  Vesting . A Participant shall at all times be one-hundred (100) percent vested in any amounts credited to his or her Account.
   5.4  Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization . If any change is made to the shares of Common Stock without the Company s
receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the number and/or class of securities credited to a Participant s Account under the Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that adjustments are made to the maximum
number and/or class of securities issuable under the Company s 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors.    6.  Distribution of Account
Balances     6.1  Distribution Form   
 (a) In the event a Participant elects to have the distribution of a deferred amount (and dividends thereon) commence thirty (30) days
following the date of his or her Separation from Service pursuant to Section 6.2, the Participant may elect to have the deferred amount (and dividends thereon) distributed in a lump sum payment or in equal annual installments over a period of
five (5) years. Such election must be made at the time of making the initial deferral election under Section 5.1.    (b) In the
event a Participant fails to specify the form in which a deferred amount (and dividends thereon) will be distributed at the time of making an initial deferral election under Section 5.1, or if a Participant elects to receive a distribution
other than pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i), the Participant shall receive such deferred amount (and dividends thereon) in a lump sum payment.  
 (c) Distribution of a Participant s Account balance shall be made in Common Stock; provided, however, any fractional shares of Common
Stock credited to the Account shall be paid in cash.    6.2  Distribution Time   
 (a) A Participant may elect to have the distribution of a deferred amount (and dividends thereon) commence thirty (30) days following:
(i) the date of the Participant s Separation from Service; (ii) the first, second, third, fourth or fifth anniversary of the Participant s Separation from Service; or (iii) a specified date or, if earlier, the fifth
anniversary of the Participant s Separation from Service (provided that the specified date must be at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the final payment of the deferred amount would have been made to the Participant absent
deferral).  
      3  

(b) A Participant must elect the date on which distributions will commence at the time of making
the initial deferral election under Section 5.1. In the event a Participant fails to elect the date on which a distribution will commence at the time of making an initial deferral election under Section 5.1, or if a Participant specifies a
date under Section 6.2(a)(iii) that is less than twelve (12) months after the date on which the final payment of the deferred amount would have been made to the Participant absent deferral, the Participant shall receive the distribution
thirty (30) days following the date of the Participant s Separation from Service.    (c) Except as otherwise permitted under IRS
guidance, if a distribution is to be made upon the Separation from Service of a Key Employee, distribution may not be made before the date which is six months after the date of the Key Employee s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the
date of death of the Key Employee). Any payments that would otherwise be made during this period of delay shall be paid in the seventh month following Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the month after the Key Employee s death). For this
purpose,  Key Employee  means an individual treated as a  specified employee  under Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) as of his or her Separation from Service (i.e., a key employee (as defined under Code section 416(i) without regard
to paragraph (5) thereof) of a corporation any stock of which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise). Key Employees shall be determined in accordance with Code section 409A, using a December 31 identification
date. A listing of Key Employees as of an identification date shall be effective for the 12-month period beginning on the April 1 following the identification date.  
 (d) Notwithstanding Section 6.1 or 6.2 or any election to the contrary, for purposes of Eligible Compensation earned during each separate
quarterly period beginning after 2014, if a Participant Separates from Service during a separate quarterly period, the distribution of any deferred amount (and dividends thereon) attributable to such period will be paid in a cash lump sum within 30
days following the last day of the quarterly period, subject to Section 6.2(c) and in accordance with Treasury Regulation  1.409A-3(c).  
 6.3  Distributions upon Death   
 (a) In the event a Participant dies prior to the distribution of his or her entire Account balance, the remaining Account balance shall be
distributed to the Participant s beneficiary in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above.    (b) A Participant shall designate his or
her beneficiary prior to death in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator. If a Participant has not properly designated a beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary is living on the date of any distribution, such amount
shall be distributed to the Participant s estate.    (c) For purposes of determining the proper death beneficiary under this Plan, this
Plan shall not be interpreted as preempting applicable state law regarding the ownership rights of Accounts upon a Participant s death. For example, although this Plan states that upon a Participant s death, Account balances will be paid
to his or her beneficiary, the personal representative will be obligated to pay any benefits owed to a spouse or otherwise as a result of any applicable community property laws.  
 7.  Administration     The Plan
Administrator shall be responsible for the operation and administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions hereof. The Plan Administrator shall have the full authority and discretion to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all
appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions, including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in connection with this Plan. Any such action taken by the Plan Administrator
shall be final and conclusive on any party. To the extent the Plan Administrator has been granted discretionary authority under the Plan, the Plan Administrator s prior exercise of such authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority
in a like fashion thereafter. The Plan Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon all tables,  
      4  

valuations, certificates, opinions and reports furnished by any actuary, accountant, controller, counsel or other person employed or engaged by the Company with respect to the Plan. The Plan
Administrator may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to such agents, including the HR Officer or other employees of the Company, such administrative duties as it sees fit, and the HR Officer is expressly delegated the authority to take
all actions necessary to implement the Plan in accordance with the terms approved by the Board and the Plan Administrator.    8.  Amendment and
Termination     8.1  Amendment or Termination . The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan when, in the sole
discretion of the Company, such amendment or termination is advisable, pursuant to a resolution or other action taken by the Board or the Plan Administrator, provided that the Board or Plan Administrator may delegate the authority to amend the Plan
to the HR Officer from time to time.    8.2  Effect of Amendment or Termination . No amendment or termination of the Plan shall
decrease the amounts credited to a Participant s Account as of such amendment or termination. Upon termination of the Plan, Participants  Account balances shall be distributed in accordance with Sections 6.1 through 6.3, unless the Company
determines in its sole discretion that all such amounts shall be distributed upon termination in accordance with the requirements under Code section 409A.  
 8.3  Constructive Receipt Termination . If amounts deferred under the Plan must be included in income under Code section 409A prior to
the scheduled distribution of such amounts, distribution of such amount shall be made to Participants.    9.  General Provisions   
 9.1  Rights Unsecured . The right of a Participant or his or her beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder shall be an unsecured
claim against the general assets of the Company, and neither the Participant nor his or her beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any amount credited to any Account or any other specific assets of the Company. The Plan at all times shall
be considered entirely unfunded for tax purposes. Any funds set aside by the Company for the purpose of meeting its obligations under the Plan, including any amounts held by a trustee, shall continue for all purposes to be part of the general assets
of the Company and shall be available to its general creditors in the event of the Company s bankruptcy or insolvency. The Company s obligation under this Plan shall be that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.
   9.2  Construction of Plan . Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to give any Director any right to receive Eligible Compensation
or any other type of compensation. No Participant or beneficiary shall have any right to receive a distribution under the Plan except in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Establishment of the Plan shall not be construed to give any Participant
the right to be retained as a member of the Board. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guarantee by the Company or any other person or entity that the assets of the Company will be sufficient to pay any benefits hereunder. In the event
any provision of the Plan shall be held invalid or illegal for any reason, any illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never
been inserted. Words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine and the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa, unless qualified by the context. Any headings used herein are included for ease of reference only, and are not to be
construed so as to alter the terms hereof.    9.3  Nonalienation of Benefits . This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon
the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided, however, that the amounts credited to a Participant s Account are not, except as provided in Section 9.4, subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale,
transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any
right to any benefits payable hereunder, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the Company.  
      5  

9.4  Taxes . The Company or other payor may withhold from a benefit payment under the Plan
or a Participant s Eligible Compensation any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to a payment or accrual under the Plan, and shall report such payments and other Plan-related information to the appropriate
governmental agencies as required under applicable law.    9.5  Delivery of Shares . The obligation of the Company to issue shares of
Common Stock under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed necessary or
appropriate by the Plan Administrator.    9.6  Participant s Cooperation . The Participant shall cooperate with the Company by
furnishing any and all information requested by the Plan Administrator in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder. If the Participant refuses to cooperate, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Participant under the Plan.
   9.7  Incapacity of Recipient . If any person entitled to a distribution under the Plan is deemed by the Plan Administrator to be
incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for such payment, then, unless and until a claim for such payment shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian or other legal representative of such person, the Plan Administrator may
provide for such payment or any part thereof to be made to any other person or institution then contributing toward or providing for the care and maintenance of such person. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of such person and a
complete discharge of any liability of the Company and the Plan with respect to the payment.    9.8  Legally Binding . In the event of
any consolidation, merger, acquisition or reorganization, the obligations of the Company under this Plan shall continue and be binding on the Company and its successors or assigns. The rights, privileges, benefits and obligations under the Plan are
intended to be legal obligations of the Company and binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns.    9.9  Unclaimed Benefits .
Each Participant shall keep the Plan Administrator informed of his or her current address and the current address of his or her designated beneficiary. The Plan Administrator shall not be obligated to search for the whereabouts of any person if the
location of a person is not made known to the Plan Administrator.    9.10  Applicable Law and Venue . The Plan shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Washington. In the event the Company or any Participant (or beneficiary) initiates litigation related to this Plan, the venue for such action will be in King County, Washington.  
 9.11  Waiver of Breach . The waiver by the Company of any breach of any provision of the Plan by a Participant shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the Participant.    9.12  Notice . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be
given to the Plan Administrator under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by first class mail to the principal office of the Company, directed to the attention of the Plan Administrator. Such notice shall be deemed
given as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark.    9.13  Attorneys  Fees and
Costs . In the event that a dispute regarding benefits arises between the Company or Plan Administrator and a Participant (or beneficiary) and such dispute is resolved through arbitration or litigation in court, the prevailing party(ies) shall be
entitled to their reasonable attorneys  fees and costs incurred in such action.

Exhibit 10.18  
   EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN    
   (Section 162(m) Performance-Based Awards)    
   STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT UNDER    
   THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION 2001 STOCK PLAN    
   Award Number   GrantIdentifier    
 This Award Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of an award (the  Award ) of performance-based Stock Awards ( SAs ) awarded to
  FullName   ( Awardee ) by Microsoft Corporation (the  Company ) in the exercise of its sole discretion under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan (the  Plan ) and pursuant to the Microsoft
Corporation Executive Officer Incentive Plan (the  EOIP ) on   GrantDate   (the  Award Date ). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Award Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Plan.    1.  Award .    (a) The number of SAs initially
subject to the Award (the  GrantedSAs ) is   Granted SAs  . The performance period of the Award (the  Performance Period ) is the Company s   Year   fiscal year. At the end of the
Performance Period, the Committee (as that term is defined in Section 2(f) of the Plan) will determine the number of SAs earned under the Award as set forth in Section 2 (these earned SAs are the  Earned SAs ).  
 (b) The Earned SAs represent the Company s unfunded and unsecured promise to issue Common Shares at a future date, subject to the terms of this Award
Agreement and the Plan. Awardee has no rights under the Earned SAs other than the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.    2.
 Performance Goal; Earned SAs .    (a) Not later than 90 days after the beginning of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the
performance goal (the  Performance Goal ) for the Performance Period under the EOIP, which shall apply to this Award and shall be set forth in  Schedule A .  
 (b) Within a reasonable time after the close of the Performance Period, and in no event later than 90 days following the close of the Performance Period, the
Committee shall determine whether the Performance Goal has been met and, if applicable, certify in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 162(m) to its satisfaction. The date the Committee makes this determination is the
 Determination Date . If the Performance Goal has not been met, the number of Earned SAs will be zero. If the Performance Goal has been met, the number of Earned SAs will be determined by the Committee in accordance with  Schedule A. 

3.  Vesting of SAs .  
 (a) Subject to the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan and provided that Awardee remains continuously employed through the vesting dates set out
below, the Earned SAs shall vest as follows:      

Vesting Date   
    
  Percentage of Earned SAs  

[Insert six-month anniversary of last business day in August preceding the Award Date] ( Initial Vest Date )   

12.5 
 %   
 
    Each 6 month anniversary of the Initial Vest Date   

12.5 
 %   
   Vesting will not occur before the first NASDAQ Stock Market regular trading day that is on or after the applicable vesting
date.    (b) Awardee agrees that the SAs subject to this Award Agreement, and other incentive or performance-based compensation Awardee receives or has
received from the Company, shall be subject to the Company s executive compensation recovery policy, as amended from time to time.    (c)
AWARDEE S RIGHTS IN THE SAs SHALL BE AFFECTED, WITH REGARD TO BOTH VESTING SCHEDULE AND TERMINATION, BY LEAVES OF ABSENCE, CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED, PARTIAL DISABILITY, AND OTHER CHANGES IN AWARDEE S EMPLOYMENT STATUS AS
PROVIDED IN THE COMPANY S CURRENT POLICIES FOR THESE MATTERS. ACCOMPANYING THIS AWARD AGREEMENT IS A CURRENT COPY OF THESE POLICIES. THESE POLICIES MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT NOTICE IN THE COMPANY S SOLE DISCRETION, AND
AWARDEE S RIGHTS WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE POLICIES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF ANY EMPLOYMENT STATUS CHANGE. E-MAIL  BENEFITS  FOR A COPY OF THE MOST CURRENT POLICIES.  
 4.  Termination . Unless terminated earlier under Section 5, 6 or 7 below, an Awardee s rights under this Award Agreement with respect to the
SAs under this Award Agreement shall terminate at the time the SAs are converted into Common Shares and distributed to Awardee.    5.  Termination of
Awardee s Status as a Participant . Except as otherwise specified in Section 6, 7 and 8 below, in the event of termination of Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant (as that term is defined in Section 2(j) of the Plan),
Awardee s rights under this Award Agreement in any unvested SAs shall terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, an Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant terminates at the time Awardee s actual employer ceases to be the Company or
a  Subsidiary  of the Company, as that term is defined in Section 2(y) of the Plan, and except as otherwise specified in Section 6, 7 and 8 below, no person shall have any rights as an Awardee under this Award Agreement unless he
or she is in Continuous Status as a Participant on the Award Date.    6.  Disability of Awardee . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5
above, in the event of termination of Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant as a result of total and permanent disability (as that term is defined in Section 12(c) of the Plan), outstanding unvested Earned SAs shall become
immediately vested.    7.  Death of Awardee . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, if Awardee is, at the time of death, in
Continuous Status as a Participant, outstanding unvested Earned SAs shall become immediately vested.  

8.  Retirement of Awardee; Severance .  
 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of Awardee s Retirement, Awardee shall be treated as continuously employed
through the vesting dates in Section 3(a) above. For this purpose,  Retirement  means termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary after the earlier of (a) age 65, or (b) attaining age 55 and 15 years of
Continuous Service, provided that immediately prior to termination of employment Awardee is employed by Microsoft (or a Subsidiary) in the United States.  
 This Section 8 will only apply to a Retirement if (a) the Retirement occurs more than one year after the Award Date, (b) Awardee executes a
release in conjunction with the Retirement in the form provided by the Company, and (c) Awardee s employment does not terminate due to misconduct (as determined in the sole discretion of the Company s senior corporate officer in
charge of the Human Resources department), including but not limited to misconduct in violation of Company policy and misconduct that adversely affects the Company s interests or reputation.  
 For purposes of this Section 8,  Continuous Service  means that Awardee has continuously remained an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary,
measured from Awardee s  most recent hire date  as reflected in the Company records. For an Awardee who became an employee of the Company following the acquisition of his or her employer by the Company or a Subsidiary, service with
the acquired employer shall count toward Continuous Service, and Continuous Service shall be measured from Awardee s acquired company hire date as reflected in the Company s records.  
 If the Awardee dies after an eligible Retirement under this Section 8, then any shares that would, but for the Awardee s death, be distributed
pursuant to this Section 8 on vesting dates that follow the Awardee s death shall be immediately vested and distributed in accordance with this Award Agreement.  
 (b) Awardee may vest in shares following Awardee s termination of employment to the extent provided in a Company severance benefit plan, including the
Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan. In no event, however, shall any accelerated or continued vesting under a Company severance benefit plan change the time of payment specified under this Award Agreement.  
 9.  Value of Unvested SAs . In consideration of the award of these SAs, Awardee agrees that upon and following termination of Awardee s Continuous
Status as a Participant for any reason (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), and regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice, or pre-termination procedure or whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that
Awardee s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice or pre-termination procedure, any unvested SAs under this Award Agreement shall be deemed to have a value of zero dollars ($0.00).  
 10.  Conversion of SAs to Common Shares; Responsibility for Taxes .  
 (a) Provided Awardee has satisfied the requirements of Section 10(b) below, on the vesting of any Earned SAs, the vested Earned SAs shall be converted
into an equivalent number of Common Shares that will be distributed to Awardee (or Awardee s legal representative, if applicable) within 90 days after the date of the vesting event (but in no event prior to the Determination Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if accelerated vesting of an SA occurs pursuant to a provision of the Plan not addressed in this Award Agreement, distribution of the related Common Share shall not occur until the date distribution would have occurred
under this Award Agreement absent this accelerated vesting. The distribution to Awardee (Awardee s legal representative, if applicable) of Common Shares in respect of the vested Earned SAs shall be evidenced by means that the Company determines
to be appropriate. In the event ownership or issuance of Common Shares is not feasible due to applicable exchange controls, securities regulations, tax laws or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion,
Awardee (Awardee s legal representative, if applicable) shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the value of the Common Shares otherwise distributable to Awardee, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, net of amounts
withheld in satisfaction of the requirements of Section 10(b) below.  

(b) Regardless of any action the Company or Awardee s actual employer takes with respect to any or all income tax (including federal, state and local taxes), social insurance, payroll tax,
payment on account, or other tax-related withholding items ( Tax-Related Items ) that arise in connection with the SAs, Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any Tax-Related Items determined by the Company in its
discretion to be legally due by Awardee, is and remains Awardee s responsibility. Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the Company and/or Awardee s actual employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of
any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the SAs, including the grant of the SAs, the vesting of Earned SAs, the conversion of Earned SAs into Common Shares or the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, the subsequent sale of any
Common Shares acquired and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the SAs to reduce or eliminate Awardee s liability for any Tax-Related
Items.    Prior to the relevant taxable or tax-withholding event, as applicable, Awardee shall pay, or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the
Company or to Awardee s actual employer (in their sole discretion) to satisfy all obligations for Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Awardee authorizes the Company or Awardee s actual employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items
from Awardee s wages or other cash compensation payable to Awardee by the Company or Awardee s actual employer. Alternatively, or in addition, the Company or Awardee s actual employer may, in their sole discretion, and without notice
to or authorization by Awardee, (i) sell or arrange for the sale of Common Shares to be issued upon the vesting of Earned SAs or other event to satisfy the withholding obligation, and/or (ii) withhold in Common Shares, provided that the
Company and Awardee s actual employer shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such other amount determined by the Company as not resulting in negative accounting consequences for the
Company. Awardee will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Common Shares subject to the Earned SAs, notwithstanding that a number of whole vested Common Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. Awardee
shall pay to the Company or to Awardee s actual employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or Awardee s actual employer may be required to withhold as a result of Awardee s receipt of SAs, the vesting of Earned SAs, or
the conversion of vested Earned SAs to Common Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means described in this paragraph. Except where applicable legal or regulatory provisions prohibit and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the
standard process for the payment of an Awardee s Tax-Related Items shall be for the Company or Awardee s actual employer to withhold in Common Shares only to the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such
other amount determined by the Company as not resulting in negative accounting consequences for the Company. The Company may refuse to deliver Common Shares to Awardee if Awardee fails to comply with Awardee s obligation in connection with the
Tax-Related Items as described in this section 10.    (c) In lieu of issuing fractional Common Shares, on the vesting of a fraction of an Earned SA,
the Company shall round the shares down to the nearest whole share and any such share that represents a fraction of a SA will be included in a subsequent vest date.  
 (d) Until the distribution to Awardee of the Common Shares in respect of the vested Earned SAs is evidenced by deposit in Awardee s brokerage
account, Awardee shall have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Common Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of Earned SAs. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which
the record date is prior to the date Awardee is recorded as the owner of the Common Shares, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.  
 (e) By accepting the Award of SAs evidenced by this Award Agreement, Awardee agrees not to sell any of the Common Shares received on account of vested
Earned SAs at a time when applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply so long as Awardee is an Employee, Consultant or outside director of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.  

11.  Non-Transferability of SAs . Awardee s right in the SAs awarded under this Award Agreement and any
interest therein may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. SAs shall not be subject to execution, attachment or other process.  
 12.  Acknowledgment of Nature of Plan and SAs . In accepting the Award, Awardee acknowledges that:  
 (a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company
at any time, as provided in the Plan;    (b) the Award of SAs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive
future awards of SAs or other awards, or benefits in lieu of SAs even if SAs have been awarded repeatedly in the past;    (c) all decisions with
respect to SAs or other future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;    (d) Awardee s participation in the Plan is
voluntary;    (e) the future value of the underlying Common Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;  
 (f) if Awardee receives Common Shares, the value of the Common Shares acquired on vesting of Earned SAs may increase or decrease in value;  
 (g) notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the Plan to the contrary and consistent with Section 5 above, in the event of termination of
Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant under circumstances where Section 8 above does not apply (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), Awardee s right to receive SAs and vest under the Plan, if any, will terminate
effective as of the date that Awardee is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law. Awardee s right to receive Common Shares pursuant to any Earned SAs after termination of
Continuous Status as a Participant, if any, will be calculated as of the date of termination of Awardee s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law. The senior corporate officer in charge of
the Human Resources department shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Awardee is no longer actively employed for purposes of the award of SAs; and  
 (h) Awardee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice or pre-termination procedure or
whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that Awardee s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice or pre-termination procedure, Awardee has no right to, and will not bring any legal claim or action for, (a) any
damages for any portion of any Earned SAs that have been vested and converted into Common Shares, or (b) termination of any unvested SAs under this Award Agreement.

Exhibit 10.25  
   Executive Officer Incentive Plan    
   PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT UNDER    
   THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION 2001 STOCK PLAN    
 Award Number                         
 This Award Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of an award (the  Award ) of performance stock awards ( PSAs ) awarded to
  FullName   ( Awardee ) by Microsoft Corporation (the  Company ) in the exercise of its sole discretion under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan (the  Plan ) and pursuant to the Microsoft
Corporation Executive Officer Incentive Plan (the  EOIP ) on   GrantDate   (the  Award Date ). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Award Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Plan.    1.  Award .    (a) The Award is earned over a
performance period beginning                      and ending June 30,             
(the  Performance Period ). Under the Award, the number of shares that may be earned at target performance for the Performance Period is      TargetShares    ( Target Award ), and the maximum number
of shares that may be earned for the Performance Period is      MaxShares   . At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee (as that term is defined in Section 2(f) of the Plan) will determine the number of
PSAs earned under the Award as set forth in Section 2 (these earned PSAs are the  Earned PSAs ).    (b) The PSAs represent the Company s
unfunded and unsecured promise to issue Common Shares at a future date, subject to the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan. Awardee has no rights under the PSAs other than the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.  
 2.  Performance Goal; Earned PSAs .    (a) The performance
goal for the Performance Period is that the Company have positive operating income for the Performance Period, as reported in the Company s financial statements (the  Performance Goal ).  
 (b) Within 90 days following the close of the Performance Period, the Committee shall assess performance against the Performance Goal in accordance with
Section 4.2 of the EOIP. If the Performance Goal for the Performance Period is achieved, the Committee also shall determine the number of Earned PSAs pursuant to Appendix A; provided that in no event may the number of Earned PSAs exceed the
maximum amount specified in Section 1(a) or in Section 4.1 of the EOIP. If the Performance Goal for the Performance Period is not achieved, the number of Earned PSAs shall be zero. The date the Committee makes the determination of the
number of Earned PSAs is the  Determination Date  for the Performance Period.    3.  Vesting of PSAs .  
 (a) Earned PSAs shall vest on the first NASDAQ Stock Market regular trading day that is on or after the Determination Date, subject to the terms of this Award
Agreement and the Plan and provided that Awardee remains continuously employed through the last day of the Performance Period.  

(b) Awardee agrees that the PSAs subject to this Award Agreement, and other incentive or performance-based
compensation Awardee receives or has received from the Company, shall be subject to the Company s executive compensation recovery policy, as amended from time to time.  
 4.  Termination . Unless terminated earlier under Section 5, 6 or 7 below, an Awardee s rights under this Award Agreement with respect to the
PSAs under this Award Agreement shall terminate at the time the PSAs are converted into Common Shares and distributed to Awardee.    5.  Termination of
Awardee s Status as a Participant . Except as otherwise specified in Section 6 or 7 below, in the event of termination of Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant (as that term is defined in Section 2(j) of the Plan),
Awardee s rights under this Award Agreement in any unvested PSAs shall terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, an Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant terminates at the time Awardee s actual employer ceases to be the Company or
a  Subsidiary  of the Company, as that term is defined in Section 2(y) of the Plan, and except as otherwise specified in Section 6 or 7 below, no person shall have any rights as an Awardee under this Award Agreement unless he or
she is in Continuous Status as a Participant on the Award Date.    6.  Disability or Death of Awardee .  
 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of termination of Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant as a result of
total and permanent disability (as that term is defined in Section 12(c) of the Plan) before the end of the Performance Period, the Awardee shall become immediately vested in the Target Award.  
 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, if at the time of Awardee s death before the end of the Performance Period he or she is in
Continuous Status as a Participant (including pursuant to Section 7(a) below), the Awardee shall become immediately vested in the Target Award. If Awardee vests in the Target Award pursuant to Section 6(b), then no vesting shall occur
pursuant to the Retirement vesting provisions of Section 7(a).    7.  Retirement of Awardee; Severance .  
 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of Awardee s Retirement, Awardee shall be treated as continuously employed
through the vesting date in Section 3(a) above; provided that any Earned PSAs shall be prorated, so that the number of PSAs that vest shall be calculated by multiplying the number of Earned PSAs by (i) the number of calendar months in
which Awardee was in Continuous Service (including partial months) from the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of Awardee s Retirement, divided by (ii) the number of calendar months (including partial months) in the
Performance Period. For this purpose,  Retirement  means termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary after the earlier of (a) age 65, or (b) attaining age 55 and 15 years of Continuous Service, provided that
immediately prior to termination of employment Awardee is employed by Microsoft (or a Subsidiary) in the United States.    This Section 7 will only
apply to a Retirement if (i) the Retirement occurs more than one year after the beginning of the Performance Period, (ii) Awardee executes a release in conjunction with the Retirement in the form provided by the Company, and
(iii) Awardee s employment does not terminate due to misconduct (as determined in the sole discretion of the Company s senior corporate officer in charge of the Human Resources department), including but not limited to misconduct in
violation of Company policy and misconduct that adversely affects the Company s interests or reputation.    For purposes of this Section 7,
 Continuous Service  means that Awardee has continuously remained an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, measured from Awardee s  most recent hire date  as reflected  

in the Company records. For an Awardee who became an employee of the Company following the acquisition of his or her employer by the Company or a Subsidiary, service with the acquired employer
shall count toward Continuous Service, and Continuous Service shall be measured from Awardee s acquired company hire date as reflected in the Company s records.  
 If the Awardee dies after an eligible Retirement under this Section 7, then any Common Shares that would, but for the Awardee s death, be
distributed pursuant to this Section 7 on the vesting date that follows the Awardee s death shall be vested and distributed after such vesting date in accordance with this Award Agreement.  
 (b) Awardee may vest in PSAs following Awardee s termination of employment to the extent provided in a Company severance benefit plan, including the
Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan. In no event, however, shall any accelerated or continued vesting under a Company severance benefit plan change the time of payment specified under this Award Agreement.  
 8.  Value of Unvested PSAs . In consideration of the award of these PSAs, Awardee agrees that upon and following termination of Awardee s Continuous
Status as a Participant for any reason (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), and regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice, or pre-termination procedure or whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that
Awardee s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice or pre-termination procedure, any unvested PSAs under this Award Agreement shall be deemed to have a value of zero dollars ($0.00).  
 9.  Conversion of PSAs to Common Shares; Responsibility for Taxes .  
 (a) Provided Awardee has satisfied the requirements of Section 9(b) below, on the vesting of any Earned PSAs, the vested Earned PSAs shall be converted
into an equivalent number of Common Shares that will be distributed to Awardee (or Awardee s legal representative, if applicable) within 60 days after the date of the vesting event (but in no event prior to the Determination Date, except in the
event of accelerated vesting under Section 6 above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if accelerated vesting of a PSA occurs pursuant to a provision of the Plan not addressed in this Award Agreement, to the extent required by Code section 409A,
distribution of the related Common Share shall not occur until the date distribution would have occurred under this Award Agreement absent this accelerated vesting. The distribution to Awardee (or Awardee s legal representative, if applicable)
of Common Shares in respect of the vested Earned PSAs shall be evidenced by means that the Company determines to be appropriate. In the event ownership or issuance of Common Shares is not feasible due to applicable exchange controls, securities
regulations, tax laws or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, Awardee (or Awardee s legal representative, if applicable) shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the value of the
Common Shares otherwise distributable to Awardee, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, net of amounts withheld in satisfaction of the requirements of Section 9(b) below.  
 (b) Regardless of any action the Company or Awardee s actual employer takes with respect to any or all income tax (including federal, state and local
taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account, or other tax-related withholding items ( Tax-Related Items ) that arise in connection with the PSAs, Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any Tax-Related
Items determined by the Company in its discretion to be legally due by Awardee, is and remains Awardee s responsibility. Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the Company and/or Awardee s actual employer (i) make no representations or
undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the PSAs, including the grant of the PSAs, the vesting of Earned PSAs, the conversion of Earned PSAs into Common Shares or the receipt of an equivalent
cash payment, the subsequent sale of  

any Common Shares acquired and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the PSAs to reduce or
eliminate Awardee s liability for any Tax-Related Items.    Prior to the relevant taxable or tax-withholding event, as applicable, Awardee shall pay,
or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or to Awardee s actual employer (in their sole discretion) to satisfy all obligations for Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Awardee authorizes the Company or Awardee s actual
employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items from Awardee s wages or other cash compensation payable to Awardee by the Company or Awardee s actual employer. Alternatively, or in addition, the Company or Awardee s actual
employer may, in their sole discretion, and without notice to or authorization by Awardee, (i) sell or arrange for the sale of Common Shares to be issued upon the vesting of Earned PSAs or other event to satisfy the withholding obligation,
and/or (ii) withhold in Common Shares, provided that the Company and Awardee s actual employer shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such other amount determined by the Company as
not resulting in negative accounting consequences for the Company. Awardee will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Common Shares subject to the Earned PSAs, notwithstanding that a number of whole vested Common Shares are held back
solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. Awardee shall pay to the Company or to Awardee s actual employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or Awardee s actual employer may be required to withhold as a result
of Awardee s receipt of PSAs, the vesting of Earned PSAs, or the conversion of vested Earned PSAs to Common Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means described in this paragraph. Except where applicable legal or regulatory provisions
prohibit and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the standard process for the payment of an Awardee s Tax-Related Items shall be for the Company or Awardee s actual employer to withhold in Common Shares only to the amount
of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such other amount determined by the Company as not resulting in negative accounting consequences for the Company. The Company may refuse to deliver Common Shares to Awardee if Awardee
fails to comply with Awardee s obligation in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section 9.    (c) In lieu of issuing
fractional Common Shares, on the vesting of a fraction of an Earned PSA, the Company shall round the shares down to the nearest whole share.    (d) Until
the distribution to Awardee of the Common Shares in respect of the vested Earned PSAs is evidenced by deposit in Awardee s brokerage account, Awardee shall have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with
respect to such Common Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of Earned PSAs. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date Awardee is recorded as the owner of the Common Shares, except as
provided in Section 14 of the Plan.    (e) By accepting the Award of PSAs evidenced by this Award Agreement, Awardee agrees not to sell any of the
Common Shares received on account of vested Earned PSAs at a time when applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply so long as Awardee is an Employee, Consultant or outside director of the Company or a Subsidiary
of the Company.    10.  Non-Transferability of PSAs . Awardee s right in the PSAs awarded under this Award Agreement and any interest therein may
not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. PSAs shall not be subject to execution, attachment or other process.  

11. 
  Acknowledgment of Nature of Plan and PSAs . In accepting the Award, Awardee acknowledges that:      (a) the
Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan;  
 (b) the Award of PSAs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of PSAs or other awards, or
benefits in lieu of PSAs even if PSAs have been awarded repeatedly in the past;    (c) all decisions with respect to PSAs or other future awards, if any,
will be at the sole discretion of the Company;    (d) Awardee s participation in the Plan is voluntary;  
 (e) the future value of the underlying Common Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;  
 (f) if Awardee receives Common Shares, the value of the Common Shares acquired on vesting of Earned PSAs may increase or decrease in value;  
 (g) notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the Plan to the contrary and consistent with Section 5 above, in the event of termination of
Awardee s Continuous Status as a Participant under circumstances where Section 7 above does not apply (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), Awardee s right to receive PSAs, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that
Awardee is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law. Awardee s right to receive Common Shares pursuant to any Earned PSAs after termination of Continuous Status as a Participant, if
any, will be calculated as of the date of termination of Awardee s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law; or if later, the Determination Date in the event of continued vesting under
Section 7 above. The senior corporate officer in charge of the Company s Human Resources department has the exclusive discretion to determine when Awardee is no longer actively employed for purposes of the award of PSAs; and  
 (h) Awardee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice or pre-termination procedure or whether
Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that Awardee s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice or pre-termination procedure, Awardee has no right to, and will not bring any legal claim or action for, (a) any damages for
any portion of any Earned PSAs that have been vested and converted into Common Shares, or (b) termination of any unvested PSAs under this Award Agreement.  
 12.  No Employment Right . Awardee acknowledges that neither the fact of this Award of PSAs nor any provision of this Award Agreement or the Plan or the
policies adopted pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon Awardee any right with respect to employment or continuation of current employment with the Company or with Awardee s actual employer, or to employment that is not terminable at will.
Awardee further acknowledges and agrees that neither the Plan nor this Award of PSAs makes Awardee s employment with the Company or Awardee s actual employer for any minimum or fixed period, and that this employment is subject to the
mutual consent of Awardee and the Company or Awardee s actual employer, and may be terminated by either Awardee or the Company or Awardee s actual employer at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without cause or notice or any
kind of pre- or post-termination warning, discipline or procedure.    13.  Administration . Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the
authority to manage and control the operation and administration of this Award Agreement shall be vested in the Committee, and the Committee shall have all powers and discretion with respect to this Award Agreement as it has with respect to the
Plan. Any interpretation of the Award Agreement by the Committee and any decision made  

by the Committee with respect to the Award Agreement shall be final and binding on all parties. References to the Committee in this Award Agreement shall be read to include a reference to any
delegate of the Committee acting within the scope of his or her delegation.    14.  Plan Governs . Except as provided in Schedule A, this Award
Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Plan and the EOIP, and this Award Agreement is subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee from time to time pursuant to the Plan and the EOIP.  
 15.  Notices . Any written notices provided for in this Award Agreement that are sent by mail shall be deemed received three business days after mailing,
but not later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to Awardee, at Awardee s address indicated by the Company s records and, if to the Company, at the Company s principal executive office.  
 16.  Electronic Delivery . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to PSAs awarded under the Plan or future PSAs
that may be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or request Awardee s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. Awardee hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan
through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.    17.
 Acknowledgment . By Awardee s acceptance of this Award Agreement in the manner prescribed by the Company, Awardee acknowledges that Awardee has received and has read, understood and accepted all the terms, conditions and restrictions of
this Award Agreement (including the policy referenced in Section 3(b)) and the Plan. Awardee understands and agrees that this Award Agreement is subject to all the terms, conditions, and restrictions stated in this Award Agreement and in the
other documents referenced in the preceding sentence, as the latter may be amended from time to time in the Company s sole discretion.    18.  Board
Approval . These PSAs have been awarded pursuant to the Plan and this Award of PSAs has been approved by the Committee or the Board of Directors.    19.
 Governing Law and Venue . This Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without regard to Washington laws that might cause other law to govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law. The venue
for any litigation related to this Award Agreement will be in King County, Washington.    20.  Severability . If one or more of the provisions of this
Award Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions shall be deemed null and void; however, to the extent permissible by law, any provisions that could be deemed null and void shall first be construed, interpreted or revised retroactively to permit this Award Agreement to be construed so
as to foster the intent of this Award Agreement and the Plan.    21.  Complete Award Agreement and Amendment . This Award Agreement (including the
policy referenced in Section 3(b)) and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between Awardee and the Company regarding PSAs. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning these PSAs are superseded. This Award Agreement may be
amended only by written agreement of Awardee and the Company, without consent of any other person, provided that no consent is necessary to an amendment that in the reasonable judgment of the Committee confers a benefit on Awardee. Awardee agrees

To the extent applicable, each payment under this Award Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Code section 409A.    23.  Code
