PART I            

ITEM 1.         BUSINESS             

  Celgene Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, "we," "our," "us," "Celgene" or the "Company") is a global biopharmaceutical company
primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory related diseases. We are dedicated to innovative research
and development designed to bring new therapies to market and are involved in research in several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, targeting areas
such as intracellular signaling pathways in cancer and immune cells, immunomodulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases, and therapeutic application of cell therapies. Celgene was incorporated in the
State of Delaware in 1986.   

  Our
primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID , VIDAZA , ABRAXANE , THALOMID  (inclusive of Thalidomide
Celgene ), and ISTODAX . POMALYST  was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2013 for patients with multiple
myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.
Additional sources of revenue include royalties from Novartis on their sales of FOCALIN XR  and the entire RITALIN  family of drugs, other licensing royalties,
and the sale of services through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary.   

  We
make significant investments in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support both our existing products and our pipeline of new
drug candidates. REVLIMID  is in several phase III trials across a range of hematological malignancies that include newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and maintenance, lymphomas,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and non-deletion 5q myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS. Phase III trials for POMALYST  in myelofibrosis, VIDAZA 
in acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and CC-486 for MDS and AML are also underway. In solid tumors, we continue to evaluate ABRAXANE  in a phase III trial for
metastatic melanoma and have recently completed a phase III trial for ABRAXANE  in pancreatic cancer. Our lead product candidate in Inflammation   Immunology, apremilast,
is being evaluated in broad phase III programs for psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.   

  Beyond
our phase III programs, we have developed a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel therapies to address significant unmet medical needs,
including CC-292 (BTK inhibitor), CC-223 (dual TORK inhibitor), CC-115 (dual TORK/DNA PK inhibitor), CC-122 (pleiotropic pathway modulator),
CC-220 and
CC-11050 (anti-inflammatory), PDA-001 and PDA-002 (cellular therapies), in addition to partnered molecules ACE-011 (ActR fusion protein),
ACE-536 (GDF trap), and EPZ-5676 (DOT1L inhibitor). For more information, see "  Celgene Leading Product Candidates."   

We
believe that the continued commercial success of our marketed products, our participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, the depth of our product pipeline, expected
regulatory approvals of new products and expanded use of existing products will provide multiple catalysts for our future growth.

Table of Contents   

In
recent years we have completed a number of strategic acquisitions that strengthened our research and manufacturing capabilities and enhanced our commercial product portfolio. Our most recent
strategic acquisitions include the following:  

In January 2010, we acquired Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Gloucester, which developed new therapies
to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of hematological cancers and other hematological malignancies. Gloucester added ISTODAX  to our product portfolio and advanced our
leadership position in the development of disease-altering therapies through innovative approaches for patients with rare and debilitating blood cancers.    
           In October 2010, we acquired Abraxis Bioscience Inc., or Abraxis, a fully integrated global biotechnology
company. The acquisition of Abraxis accelerated our strategy to become a global leader in oncology and added ABRAXANE , which is based on Abraxis' proprietary tumor-targeting platform
known as nab  technology, to our portfolio of leading cancer products.  
           In March 2012, we acquired Avila Therapeutics, Inc., or Avila, a clinical-stage biotechnology company
focused on the design and development of targeted covalent drugs. The acquisition added Avila's proprietary Avilomics  platform for developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases
through protein silencing and augments our investment in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics.    

COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS     

    REVLIMID  (lenalidomide):       REVLIMID  is an oral immunomodulatory drug marketed in the United States and many international markets,
in combination with dexamethasone, for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. It is also marketed in the United States and certain international
markets for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or
without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.   

  REVLIMID  is distributed in the United States through contracted pharmacies under the RevAssist  program, which is a proprietary
risk-management distribution program tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID . Internationally,
REVLIMID  is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities' specifications to provide for the safe and
appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID . These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product
may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.   

  REVLIMID  continues to be evaluated in numerous clinical trials worldwide either alone or in combination with one or more other therapies in the
treatment of a broad range of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, MDS, various lymphomas, CLL, other cancers and other diseases.   

VIDAZA  (azacitidine for injection):       VIDAZA  is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA
hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene

Table of Contents   

  re-expression.
VIDAZA  is a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, according to the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network and is marketed in the United States for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS. The U.S. regulatory exclusivity for VIDAZA  expired in May 2011. If a
generic version of VIDAZA  is successfully launched, we may quickly lose a significant portion of our sales for this product in the United States. In Europe, VIDAZA  is
marketed for the treatment of intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, as well as AML with 30% blasts, and has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of MDS and AML.
European regulatory exclusivity is expected to continue through 2018.   

    ABRAXANE  (paclitaxel albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension):       ABRAXANE  is a solvent-free chemotherapy
treatment option for metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer which was developed using our proprietary nab  technology platform. This protein-bound
chemotherapy agent combines paclitaxel with albumin. It is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the United States and many international markets and for the treatment of
non-small cell lung cancer in the United States. In January 2013, we announced the results from a phase III trial for ABRAXANE  in combination with
gemcitabine in treatment-na ve patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The ABRAXANE  combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall
survival compared to patients receiving gemcitabine alone. Based on these results, we plan to submit dossiers for registration in the U.S. and Europe during the first half of 2013 followed by
submissions in other countries and regions during the second half of 2013. ABRAXANE  is currently in various stages of investigation for the treatment of the following cancers:
expanded applications for metastatic breast, malignant melanoma, and bladder and ovarian. In October 2012, the FDA approved ABRAXANE  for the first-line treatment of
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. The FDA approval
was based on tumor response rates and the label did not include a progression-free survival claim. Accordingly, the Contingent Value Rights, or CVR, milestone payment, as described in
Note 2 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, has not been achieved.   

    THALOMID  (thalidomide):       In combination with dexamethasone, THALOMID  is marketed for patients with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, an inflammatory complication of leprosy, and as maintenance therapy for
prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of ENL recurrence.   

  THALOMID  is distributed in the United States under our "   System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing
Safety   ," or    S.T.E.P.S.    , program, our proprietary comprehensive education and risk-management
distribution program that we developed with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of THALOMID . Internationally, THALOMID  is
also distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities' specifications to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and
use of THALOMID . These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through
hospitals or retail pharmacies.

    ISTODAX  (romidepsin):       ISTODAX  is approved in the United States for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or
CTCL, in patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy and for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, in patients who have received at least one prior
therapy. ISTODAX  has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphomas, which includes CTCL and PTCL.   

    POMALYST  (pomalidomide):       POMALYST  was approved by the FDA in February 2013 for patients with multiple myeloma who have
received at least two prior therapies, including
lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy, and is under review by the European Agency for the Evaluation of
Medicinal Products, or EMA, for use in Europe. POMALYST  is a proprietary, small molecule that is administered orally and modulates the immune system and other biologically important
targets. POMALYST  is also being evaluated in a phase III clinical trial for the treatment of myelofibrosis, in multiple trials in various phases for expanded usage in multiple
myeloma and in a phase II trial for systemic sclerosis.   

  POMALYST  is distributed in the United States through contracted pharmacies under the POMALYST  REMS  program,
which is a proprietary risk-management distribution program tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of POMALYST .   

    FOCALIN , FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA :       We licensed the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) regarding
certain chirally pure forms of methylphenidate for FOCALIN  and FOCALIN XR  to Novartis. We also licensed to Novartis the rights related to
long-acting formulations of methylphenidate and dex-methylphenidate products which are used in FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA . As a
result of the grant of these licenses we receive royalties on sales of these products.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT     

  We devote significant resources to research and development programs in an effort to discover and develop potential future product candidates.
Research and development expenses amounted to $1.724 billion in 2012, $1.600 billion in 2011, and $1.128 billion in 2010. The product candidates in our
pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The path to regulatory approval includes three phases of clinical trials in which we collect data to support an application to
regulatory authorities to allow us to market a product for treatment of a specified disease. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in research and development of new products,
resulting in a high rate of failure. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes many years and significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in
the process, including after the product is approved, based on post-market factors. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have
only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, reimbursement challenges, difficulty or
excessive costs of manufacture, alternative therapies or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in
other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very   

  5  

Table of Contents   

  difficult
to predict which products will ultimately be submitted for approval, which have the highest likelihood of obtaining approval and which will be commercially viable and generate profits.
Successful results in preclinical or clinical studies may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of a drug or product candidate.   

Phase I Clinical Trials    

  Phase I
clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies allow initiation of clinical investigation of a new drug or product candidate and usually involves up to 80 healthy volunteers or
subjects. The tests study a drug's safety profile, and may include a preliminary determination of a drug or product candidate's safe dosage range. The phase I clinical trial also determines how
a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and therefore the potential duration of its action. Phase I clinical trials generally take from one to three years to
complete.   

    Phase II Clinical Trials    

  Phase II
clinical trials are conducted on a limited number of subjects with the targeted disease. An initial evaluation of the drug's effectiveness on subjects is performed and additional
information on the drug's safety and dosage range is obtained. Phase II clinical trials normally include up to several hundred subjects and may take as many as two to three years to complete.   

Phase III Clinical Trials    

  Phase III
clinical trials typically include controlled multi-center sites and involve a larger target patient population that normally consists of from several hundred to several thousand
subjects to ensure that study results are statistically significant. During phase III clinical trials, physicians monitor subjects to determine efficacy and to gather further information on
safety. These trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate all of the clinical data necessary to submit an application for marketing approval to regulatory agencies.
Phase III testing varies by disease state, but can often last from two to seven years.   

Regulatory Review    

  If
a product candidate successfully completes phase III clinical trials and is submitted to governmental regulators, such as the FDA in the United States or the EMA in the European Union, the
time to final marketing approval can vary from six months (for a U.S. filing that is designated for priority review by the FDA) to several years, depending on a number of variables, such as the
disease state, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the
agency(ies) to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval, or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be
consistent across geographic areas.   

PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL   STAGE PIPELINE     

  Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug candidates and cell therapies is highlighted by multiple classes of small molecule,
therapeutic agents designed to selectively regulate disease-associated genes and proteins. These product candidates are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development.

Table of Contents   

    Oral anti-inflammatory agents:       We are developing novel, orally administered small molecules that specifically target PDE4, an intracellular enzyme that
modulates the production of multiple pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10,
IL-12, IL-23, INF-gamma, TNF- a , leukotrienes and nitric oxide synthase. Apremilast (CC-10004), our
lead product candidate in Inflammation   Immunology, has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits in recent phase III trials in the treatment of
psoriasis (ESTEEM 1 and 2 trials) and previously treated psoriatic arthritis (PALACE 1, 2, and 3 trials). Apremilast is being evaluated in phase III trials for psoriatic arthritis
and ankylosing spondylitis and a phase II trial for the use of apremilast for Beh et's disease was recently completed. In addition, we are investigating our next generation oral
PDE4 inhibitor, CC-11050, a unique anti-inflammatory compound with the potential to treat a variety of chronic inflammatory conditions such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus.   

    Cellular therapies:       At Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, we are researching stem cells derived from the human placenta as well as from the umbilical cord. CCT
is our research and development division dedicated to fulfilling the promise of cellular technologies by developing products and therapies to significantly benefit patients. Our goal is to develop
proprietary cell therapy products for the treatment of unmet medical needs.   

  Stem
cell based therapies offer the potential to provide disease-modifying outcomes for serious diseases that lack adequate therapy. We have developed proprietary technology for collecting, processing
and storing placental stem cells with potentially broad therapeutic applications in cancer, auto-immune diseases, and other inflammatory diseases.   

  We
are developing our cellular therapies, PDA-001 (IV formulation) and PDA-002 (IM/SC injectable formulation), with the initiation of phase I safety and dose finding
studies. We are also continuing research to define the potential of placental-derived stem cells and to characterize other placental-derived products.   

    CC-486:       We have initiated two phase III trials of CC-486 that are currently enrolling to evaluate CC-486 in the
treatment of MDS and AML. In addition, a phase I trial of CC-486 for the treatment of solid tumor indications is currently in progress.   

    Sotatercept (ACE-011) and ACE-536:       We have collaborated with Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron, to develop sotatercept and
ACE-536 to treat anemia in patients with rare blood disorders. Several phase II trials are in progress to evaluate the use of sotatercept or ACE-536 in the treatment of
anemia in patients with rare blood disorders.

In
the United States, the patents covering REVLIMID  include 17 patents that are listed in the U.S. Orange Book, all of which are assigned to us. The
last-to-expire patent (2027), U.S. Patent No. 7,465,800, covers certain polymorphic forms of the pharmaceutically active ingredient of REVLIMID .   

  REVLIMID 
is also covered in foreign countries by certain patents and patent applications that correspond to certain of those listed in the U.S. Orange Book. For example, patents
related to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, uses and pharmaceutical compositions have been granted in Europe. Although certain of the patents are currently scheduled to expire in 2017 or
2018, patents granted in certain European countries, such as Spain, France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, will not expire until 2022 due to the Supplementary Protection Certificates,
or SPCs, granted in these countries. In addition, as noted in the table
above, patents in Europe that relate to certain polymorphic forms of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of REVLIMID  will not expire until 2024.

  The
patents covering THALOMID  in the United States include 18 patents that are listed in the U.S. Orange Book. The last-to-expire patent that is assigned to us
(2023), U.S. Patent No. 7,230,012, covers marketed THALOMID  formulations.   

  In
foreign countries, THALOMID  is also covered by certain patents and patent applications that correspond to certain of those listed in the U.S. Orange Book. Patents related to the
approved uses of THALOMID  have been granted in Europe. Although certain of these patents are currently scheduled to expire in 2014 or 2017, patents granted in certain
European countries, such as Spain, France and Italy, will not expire relative to certain uses of thalidomide, until 2019 due to the SPCs granted in these countries.   

In
the United States, orphan drug exclusivity with respect to VIDAZA  expired in May 2011. In Europe, new drug and orphan exclusivities relative to VIDAZA  will
expire in December 2018.   

  The
patents covering ABRAXANE  in the United States include 14 patents that are listed in the U.S. Orange Book. One patent, U.S. Patent No. 7,820,788, expiring in 2024,
covers marketed ABRAXANE  formulations. The last-to-expire patent (2026), U.S. Patent No. 8,268,348, covers approved uses of ABRAXANE .
In Europe, new drug exclusivity relative to ABRAXANE  expires in 2018. We have applied for and received in certain European countries SPCs relative to
EP 0 961 612 B1 that extend exclusivity for ABRAXANE  to 2022.   

  The
last-to-expire patents relating to ISTODAX  that are listed in the U.S. Orange Book, expire in August 2021.   

  The
patents related to POMALYST  in the United States include at least 10 patents that are anticipated to be listed in the U.S. Orange Book. One patent (2016), U.S. Patent
No. 6,316,471, covers marketed POMALYST  formulations. The last-to-expire patent (2024) is U.S. Patent No. 8,198,262 which
covers uses of POMALYST  referenced in the approved U.S. label. POMALYST  is expected to receive Orphan Drug exclusivity which will last until February 2020.   

In
the United States, the patents covering FOCALIN  include three patents that are listed in the U.S. Orange Book. All of these patents are assigned to us. The
last-to-expire patents, listed in the U.S. Orange Book, all expire in December 2015.   

  In
the United States, the patents covering FOCALIN XR  comprise six patents that are listed in the U.S. Orange Book. All of these patents are assigned to us. These patents all
expire in December 2015. A relevant European patent, owned by us, expires in June 2018.   

  In
the United States, the patents covering RITALIN LA  comprise three patents that are listed in the U.S. Orange Book. All of these patents are assigned to us. These
last-to-expire patents, all listed in the U.S. Orange Book, expire in December 2015. A related European patent, owned by us, expires in June 2018.   

With
respect to our U.S. patents for FOCALIN , FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA , litigation with generic drug companies have been resolved
pursuant to confidential settlements which allow for the entrance of their respective generic products in the United States prior to the 2015 patent expirations in the event their respective
abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, receive   

  10

  FDA
approval. In January 2012, Actavis Group, a generic manufacturer, announced the launch of a generic version of RITALIN LA .   

We
have received SPCs in Europe relative to certain in-licensed thalidomide patents, which relate to THALOMID  and extend the terms of these patents relative to certain
uses of thalidomide to 2019. Corresponding foreign patent applications and additional U.S. patent applications are still pending. Pursuant to certain agreements with the owners of the
thalidomide patents, we are obligated to comply with certain milestones and other obligations, including those relating to REVLIMID  sales.   

  In
2001, Children's Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC, granted to us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide. In December 2002,
CMCC granted to us an exclusive worldwide license to certain patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide analogs, metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide, and
stereoisomers thereof.   

  In
addition, we have applied for and received SPCs to 2022 in Europe relative to both REVLIMID  and ABRAXANE . In the United States, we have been granted a
patent term extension of a REVLIMID  composition of matter patent to 2019. In the United States, we have been granted patent term adjustment with respect to a
REVLIMID  polymorph patent; this patent is presently scheduled to expire in 2027.   

  Patent
term extensions have been granted in other markets as well, including Australia and Korea, relative to certain of our patents related to REVLIMID . Patent term extensions
relative to lenalidomide have been granted in Japan. Further, patent term extensions relative to ABRAXANE  have been secured and/or are actively being sought in Australia, Japan,
Russia and Korea. We are also considering alternative exclusivity strategies, mostly through international treaties, in a variety of countries throughout Latin America.   

  Trade
secret strategies also are important to our success and related to many of our key products.   

  Our
brand names, logos and trademarks are also important to our success. We maintain both registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark protection typically continues where and for as
long as the mark is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as long as the trademark is registered.   

  In
total, we own or have exclusively licensed nearly 400 issued U.S. patents. In addition, approximately 550 additional pending U.S. patent applications are owned by or exclusively licensed to us. We
have a policy to seek worldwide patent protection for our inventions and have foreign patent rights corresponding to most of our U.S. patents.   

  Our
research leads us to seek patent protection for molecular targets and drug discovery technologies, as well as therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. More specifically, proprietary
technology has been developed for use in molecular target discovery, the identification of regulatory pathways in cells, assay design and the discovery and development of pharmaceutical product
candidates. An increasing percentage of our recent patent applications have been related to potential product candidates or compounds.

  CCT
seeks patent protection for the collection, processing, composition, formulation and uses of mammalian placental and umbilical cord tissue and placental and umbilical cord stem cells, as well as
cells and biomaterials derived from the placenta. As of December 2012 CCT owned, in whole or in part, 24 U.S. patents, including claims to novel cells and cellular compositions. In addition,
CCT owns 92 U.S. patent applications, including pending provisional applications.   

  Our
patents are regularly subject to challenge by generic drug companies. See Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings." We rely on several different types of patents to protect our products
that may include, without limitation, compound, polymorph, formulation and method of use patents. We cannot be certain, however, whether any of these patents will be circumvented, invalidated or found
unenforceable or infringing in challenges by generic companies. For a more detailed discussion of risks related to our patent portfolio, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors."   

    GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION/EXCLUSIVITIES AFFORDED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES     

Governmental Regulation:       Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing
of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and development activities. Most, if not all, of our therapeutic products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to and after
commercialization. Human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing and post-marketing approval requirements
of the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States, various federal and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern, or impact upon the manufacturing,
testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of such products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals, and the continuing need for compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained,
may be limited in scope which may significantly limit the uses for which a product may be promoted. Further, approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing
post-marketing review, inspection and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production, which may
result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure or delay by us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees, in
obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit sharing payments.   

    Clinical Development:       Before a product may be administered to human subjects, it must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation
of a product candidate's chemistry and its biological activities and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an
Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must be reviewed by the FDA primarily for safety considerations before clinical trials in humans can begin.   

In
the United States, the FDA may grant "fast track" status (a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs) to products that treat serious diseases and fill an
unmet medical need. In addition, most drugs with fast track status would be considered candidates for priority review, which generally means that the time it takes the FDA to review a New Drug
Application, or NDA, is reduced.   

  12  

Table of Contents   

  The
FDA can also assign a Breakthrough Therapy designation to a drug or biologic. A drug intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or
life-threatening disease or condition, and that may be a substantial improvement over existing therapies, based on preliminary clinical evidence from one or more clinically significant
endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development may be designated a Breakthrough Therapy. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as Breakthrough
Therapies, robust FDA-Sponsor interaction and communication can help to identify the most efficient, expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients
placed in ineffective control regimens. A Breakthrough Therapy designation requires evidence of substantial improvement over current treatments in early clinical development.   

  Typically,
clinical trials involve a three-phase process as previously described. In some cases, further studies are required as a condition for an NDA or biologics license application, or BLA,
approval. The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials and reports of all adverse events must be made to the agency before drug approval and requires submission of
post-marketing adverse event reports after approval. The FDA may also require the Sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for the drug and indication under review if the application is for a
new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosing regimen, or route of administration.   

    FDA Review and Approval:       The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA for evaluation to determine
if there is substantial evidence that the product is safe and effective for approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval or deny approval
by requesting additional information, even new clinical trials, if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. When an NDA or BLA is approved, the NDA or BLA
holder must (a) employ a system for obtaining reports of drug adverse experience and side effects associated with the drug and make appropriate submissions to the FDA and (b) timely
advise the FDA if any marketed product fails to adhere to specifications established by the NDA or BLA.   

  The
FDA may grant "accelerated approval" to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful
therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For accelerated approval, the drug product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the
basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.   

  The
FDA may provide approval with restrictions to assure safe use. If the FDA concludes that a drug previously shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, the
FDA will require post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. The sponsor may be required to establish systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions.
In 2007, the FDA was granted authority to require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, to ensure that benefits of a drug outweigh risks. There are financial and other penalties
for non-compliance with a drug's REMS.   

For
all products that receive accelerated approval, the FDA may withdraw approval after a hearing if a post-marketing clinical study fails to verify clinical benefit, if the
applicant fails to perform the required post-marketing study with due diligence, if post-marketing restrictions are   

  13  

Table of Contents   

inadequate
to assure safe use of the product, if the applicant fails to adhere to agreed upon post-marketing restrictions, if promotional materials are false or misleading, or if other
evidence demonstrates the product is not safe or effective under its conditions of use.   

    Manufacturing Quality Control:       Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer's quality control and
manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations (which are regulations established by the FDA governing the manufacture,
processing, packing, storage and testing of drugs and biologics intended for human use). In complying with cGMP, manufacturers must devote extensive time, money and effort in the area of production
and quality control and quality assurance to maintain full technical compliance. Manufacturing facilities and company records are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance. If a
manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with these requirements, regulatory enforcement action may be taken by the FDA, which may include seeking an injunction against shipment of
products from the facility and/or recall of products previously shipped from the facility.   

    FDA Review and Enforcement:       The FDA closely reviews and regulates the marketing and promotion of drug and biologic products. FDA approval for a specified
indication is required before marketing or promoting a product for that indication. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product
("off-label promotion") or for other violations of advertising and labeling laws and regulations.   

  The
FDA may issue warning letters and untitled letters or non-compliance letters that are made public, which may require corrective actions including modification of advertising or other
corrective communications to consumers or healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions, such as license revocation or
suspension; orders for retention, recall, seizure or
destruction of product; cessation of manufacturing; injunctions; inspection warrants; search warrants; civil penalties, including fines based on the equitable remedy of disgorgement; restitution; and
criminal prosecution.   

    Post-approval:       After approval, a sponsor of a drug product has ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the drug,
including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events. Following assessment of these reports, regulatory authorities can require product label updates to reflect new safety data or
warnings. If the FDA becomes aware of new safety information, it can also require us to conduct studies or clinical trials at the time of approval or after approval to assess the potential for a
serious risk. The FDA can also impose marketing restrictions, including the suspension of marketing or complete withdrawal of a product from the market.   

    Markets Outside of the United States:       Approval procedures must be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the market for our products. The approval
procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing.   

    Exclusivities:       Pursuant to the United States Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug intended to treat a "rare disease or condition"
as an "orphan drug." The term "orphan drug" can refer to either a drug or biologic. A rare disease or condition is defined as one which affects less than 200,000 people in the United States, or which
affects more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not   

  14  

Table of Contents   

  expected
to be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of
that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States for the orphan drug for the same indication unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of
sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the approved indication and does
not prevent another company from seeking approval of an off-patent drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. The period of orphan
exclusivity is concurrent with any patent or other exclusivity that relates to the drug or biologic. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with the
drugs' development. In order to increase the development and marketing of drugs for rare disorders, regulatory bodies outside the United States have enacted regulations similar to the Orphan Drug Act.   

Under
the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the Act, products covered by approved NDAs or supplemental NDAs may be protected by periods of patent and/or
non-patent exclusivity. During the three-year marketing exclusivity period granted for reports of new clinical investigations conducted by the sponsor essential for approval,
the FDA is precluded from approving a potential competitor's Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) application. The FDA is also precluded from accepting an ANDA or
505(b)(2) application for a five-year marketing exclusivity period that is granted when an active moiety (which is a molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or
pharmacological action of the drug) has not been previously approved. An applicant is permitted to submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) after four years if it contains certification of invalidity or
non-infringement to a patent listed for the approved drug, but such application does not affect any regulatory or appropriate patent exclusivity.   

  The
FDA also grants an additional six months of market protection at the end of listed patents and/or exclusivity for the drug product's active moiety, when the drug sponsor has conducted pediatric
studies in response to a written request from the FDA. To qualify for pediatric exclusivity, an applicant must have received a written request for pediatric studies from the FDA.   

  NDAs
submitted under 505(b)(2) of the Act may not reference data contained in the NDA for a product protected by an effective and unexpired exclusivity and must include patent certifications. ANDAs
and 505(b)(2) applications are generally less burdensome than full NDAs in that, in lieu of new clinical data, the applications rely in whole, or in part, upon the safety and efficacy findings
of the referenced approved drug in conjunction with bridging data, typically bioequivalence data. Upon the expiration of the applicable exclusivities, through passage of time or successful legal
challenge, the FDA may grant effective approval of an ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a previously protected NDA in a 505(b)(2) application. Depending upon the scope of the
applicable exclusivities, any such approval could be limited to certain formulations and/or indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding exclusivities.   

  An
abbreviated pathway was established by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), enacted in 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act. The BPCI Act creates an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference product. Biological products   

  15  

Table of Contents   

  have
12 years of exclusivity, after which there may be biosimilar application approvals under the Public Health Service Act.   

  Manufacturers
also have the opportunity to take advantage of the ability for the FDA to consider single enantiomer drugs as new chemical entities for a five-year new chemical entity
exclusivity. For new chemical entity determination the new single enantiomer may not rely on clinical investigations from the racemic product's approval.   

  Under
the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act of 2011, an additional five years of marketing exclusivity is available for products approved and designated as qualified infectious disease
products, or QIDPs. A QIDP is defined as "an antibacterial or drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an
antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or (2) qualifying pathogens." A "qualifying pathogen" means a pathogen identified and listed by
the FDA as such.   

    COMPETITION     

  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive. We also compete with universities and research institutions in the
development of products and processes, and in the acquisition of technology from outside sources.   

  Competition
in the areas of oncology and inflammation and immunology areas, is particularly intense. Numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive anti-cancer and
anti-inflammatory drug discovery, development and commercial resources. AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai, Ltd., F. Hoffmann-LaRoche,
Johnson   Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, and
Takeda, are among the many companies researching and developing new compounds in the oncology and inflammation and immunology fields. We also have potential competition from generic drug
manufacturers.   

  The
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have undergone, and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change. Consolidation and competition are expected to
intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved and become more widely known. In order to compete effectively, we will be required to continually upgrade and expand our scientific expertise
and technology, identify and retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and commercially viable opportunities.   

  Our
competition will be determined in part by the indications and geographic markets for which our products are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The relative speed with
which we develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, receive pricing and reimbursement approvals, and finalize agreements with contract manufacturers, when needed, and
market our products are critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage. Competition among approved products depends, among other things, on product efficacy, safety, convenience, reliability,
availability, price, third-party reimbursement and patent and non-patent exclusivity.

    SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES     

  We have entered into a variety of alliances in the ordinary course of our business. Although we do not consider any individual alliance to be
material, the following is a brief description of certain of the more notable alliances:   

    Novartis Pharma AG:       We licensed the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) regarding certain chirally pure forms of methylphenidate for FOCALIN  and
FOCALIN XR  to Novartis. We also licensed to Novartis the rights related to long-acting formulations of methylphenidate and dex-methylphenidate products
which are used in
FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA . As a result of the grant of these licenses we sell FOCALIN  to Novartis and receive royalties of between 30%
and 35% on their sales of FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA . Under the agreement, we have received upfront and regulatory achievement milestone payments
totaling $55.0 million.   

  The
agreement will continue until the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial launch on a country-by-country basis or (ii) when the last
applicable patent expires with respect to that country. At the expiration date, we will grant Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make, have made, use,
import and sell products using the dex-methylphenidate and long-acting formulation technology.   

  The
agreement may be terminated by Novartis upon 12 months' prior written notice or by either party upon, among other things, the material breach of the other or in the event of withdrawal of
the dex-methylphenidate product or RITALIN  product from the market because of regulatory mandate.   

  If
the agreement is terminated by us, then all licenses granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate and Novartis will grant us a non-exclusive license to certain of their
intellectual property related to the compounds and products. If the agreement is terminated by Novartis then all licenses granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate.   

  When
generic versions of long-acting methylphenidate hydrochloride and dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride enter the market, we expect Novartis' sales of RITALIN LA 
and FOCALIN XR  products to decrease and therefore its royalties under this agreement to also decrease. In January 2012, Actavis Group announced the launch of a generic
version of RITALIN LA .   

    Array BioPharma Inc.:       We have a research collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma Inc., or Array, focused on the discovery, development and
commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation. As part of this agreement, we made payments to date in the aggregate amount of $59.0 million, which were recorded as research
and development expense, in return for an option to purchase exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against up to two research targets defined in the agreement. Array will be responsible
for all discovery and clinical development through phase I or phase IIa for each compound. Potential milestone payments for each compound of approximately $200.0 million (most of
which are payable subsequent to exercise of the relevant option) if certain discovery, development and
regulatory milestones are achieved, and $300.0 million if certain commercial milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on net sales.   

  17  

Table of Contents   

  During 2012
we exercised our option to extend the term of the agreement for an additional year. Our option will now terminate upon the earlier of (i) a termination of the agreement by
its terms, (ii) the date we have exercised our options for compounds developed against two of the four research targets identified, or (iii) September 21, 2013. We may
unilaterally extend the option term for an additional one-year term until September 21, 2014. During 2012, we made a $3.0 million payment to Array in order to extend
the research activities on one of the compounds.   

  If
we exercise the options for each compound, upon the expiration of the research collaboration agreement under certain circumstances, Array will grant us a fully paid-up,
royalty-free license to use certain intellectual property of Array to market and sell the compounds and products developed under the agreement.   

Acceleron Pharma:       We entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with Acceleron for the joint development and commercialization of sotatercept, or
ACE-011, currently being studied for treatment of renal anemia. The collaboration agreement, as amended, combines both companies' resources and commitment to developing products for the
treatment of cancer and cancer-related bone loss, and expands the joint development, manufacturing and commercialization of Acceleron's products to include anemia exclusivity. Under the terms of the
ACE-011 agreement, we and Acceleron will jointly develop, manufacture and commercialize Acceleron's products for the treatment of bone loss. We made a payment to Acceleron in
February 2008 of $50.0 million, which included a $5.0 million equity investment in Acceleron Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, with the remainder recorded
as research and development expense. In December 2011, we made a $25.0 million equity investment in Acceleron Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. In the event of an initial
public offering of Acceleron, we will purchase a minimum of $7.0 million of Acceleron common stock. We have agreed to pay all development costs related to ACE-011 incurred after
January 1, 2013.   

  Acceleron
is eligible to receive development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones of up to $367.0 million for the ACE-011 program and up to an additional
$348.0 million for each of three specific discovery stage programs. The parties also agreed to co-promote the products under the ACE-011 agreement in North
America. Acceleron will receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales upon the commercialization of a development compound. We made a $7.0 million development milestone payment to Acceleron
in April 2011 for the initiation of enrollment into a phase II study for chemotherapy-induced anemia.   

  In
August 2011, we also entered into a collaboration, license and option agreement with Acceleron, for the joint development and commercialization of ACE-536 for the treatment of
anemia. The ACE-536 agreement also includes an option for future Acceleron anemia programs. The ACE-536 agreement provides us with an exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-bearing license to the ACE-536 program and future Acceleron programs for the treatment of anemia. The parties also agreed to co-promote the products under the
ACE-536 agreement in the United States, Canada and Mexico.   

  In
connection with the ACE-536 agreement, we made a payment to Acceleron in the amount of $25.0 million. We have also agreed to pay all development costs incurred after
January 1, 2013. Acceleron is eligible to receive development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones of up to $217.5 million for the ACE-536 program and up to
an additional $170.8 million for the first   

  18

  discovery
stage program, $148.8 million for the second discovery stage program and $125.4 million for each additional discovery stage program thereafter. In October 2011, we made
a $7.5 million milestone payment for the initiation of a phase I clinical study of ACE-536. A $10.0 million milestone payment will be made for the January 2013
initiation of a phase II clinical study to evaluate ACE-536 for the treatment of anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Acceleron will receive tiered royalties on
worldwide net sales upon the commercialization of a development compound.   

  The
agreements for ACE-011 and ACE-536 may be terminated by us, at our sole discretion, at any time for the ACE-011 agreement, and, with respect to the
ACE-536 agreement, after completion of the initial phase II clinical trials, or by either party, among other things, upon a material breach by the other party.   

    GlobeImmune, Inc.:       We entered into a collaboration and option agreement with GlobeImmune, Inc., or GlobeImmune, as amended, focused on the discovery,
development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer. As part of this agreement, we made a payment in May 2009 of $30.0 million, which was recorded as research and
development expense, in return for the option to license certain compounds and products based on the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-6300 oncology drug
candidate programs, as well as oncology compounds and products resulting from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune. If the option is exercised, GlobeImmune will be entitled to receive potential
milestone payments of approximately $230.0 million for the GI-4000 program, $145.0 million for each of the GI-6200 and GI-3000 programs
and $161.0 million for each of the GI-6300 program and each additional future program if certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones are achieved. GlobeImmune
will also receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.   

  Our
options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-6300 oncology drug candidate programs will terminate if we do not exercise our
respective options after delivery of certain reports from GlobeImmune on the completed clinical trials with respect to each drug candidate program. If we do not exercise our options with respect to
any drug candidate program or future program, our option with respect to the oncology products resulting from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune will terminate three years after the last of the
options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-6300 oncology drug candidate programs terminates.   

    Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:       On April 14, 2010, we entered into a discovery and development collaboration and license agreement with Agios
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Agios, which focuses on cancer metabolism targets and the discovery, development and commercialization of associated therapeutics. As part of the agreement, as
amended, we paid Agios $121.2 million, which was recorded by us as research and development expense. We also made an $8.8 million equity investment in Agios Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock. In October 2011, we made a $20.0 million payment to Agios for a one year extension of our oncology collaboration and licensing agreement and in November 2011,
made a $28.7 million investment in Agios series C-2 Convertible Preferred Stock. With respect to each product in a program that we choose to license, Agios could receive up
to $120.0 million upon achievement of certain milestones plus royalties on sales, and Agios may also participate in the development and commercialization of certain products in the United
States. Agios may also receive a one-time milestone payment of $25.0 million upon dosing of the final human subject in a phase II study, such payment to be made only once
with respect to only one program. Our option will terminate on April 14, 2014.   

  19  

Table of Contents    

  We have determined that Agios is a variable interest entity; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of Agios. Although we would have the right to receive the benefits from
the collaboration and license agreement, we do not have the power to direct the activities under the collaboration and license agreement as Agios has the decision-making authority for the Joint
Steering Committee and Joint Research Committee until we exercise our option to license a product. Our interest in Agios is limited to our equity ownership and we do not have any obligations or rights
to the future losses or returns of Agios beyond this ownership.   

    Epizyme:       In April 2012, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Epizyme, Inc., or Epizyme, to discover, develop and commercialize
novel therapeutic
compounds by inhibiting histone methyltransferases (HMTs), an important epigenetic target class.   

  Under
the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $65.0 million to Epizyme and also made a $25.0 million equity investment in Epizyme Series C Preferred Stock. If
the option is exercised, Epizyme could receive up to $165.0 million in milestone payments associated with each Epizyme compound developed to inhibit each distinct HMT target under the
collaboration plus royalties on sales. Under this agreement, we have the exclusive option to license rights to HMT targets outside the United States and each Epizyme compound associated with such
target during the option term. Epizyme will have the sole responsibility to develop and commercialize compounds in the United States.   

  The
option term expires on either July 9, 2015, or July 9, 2016 if we unilaterally extend the option term for a fourth year and pay an option extension fee. Further, if an HMT target or
targets are selected then the agreement will expire upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms under the agreement with respect to all licensed Epizyme compounds. Upon the expiration of the
agreement, we will have a fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use Epizyme intellectual property to manufacture, market, use and sell such licensed Epizyme compounds
developed under the agreement outside the United States.   

    Other Collaboration Arrangements in 2012:       In addition to the collaboration arrangements described above, we entered into a number of collaborative
arrangements during 2012 that resulted in $34.5 million of assets for investments in equity or other assets and research and development expenses of $113.5 million. These
additional arrangements entered into during 2012 include the potential for future milestone payments of up to an aggregate $1.420 billion related to the attainment of specified
development and regulatory approval milestones over a period of several years. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any
adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the programs.   

    MANUFACTURING     

  We own and operate an FDA approved manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland which produces the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for
REVLIMID  and THALOMID  and have contracted with FDA approved third-party contract manufacturers to provide backup API manufacturing services for these products.
Manufacturing services for REVLIMID  and THALOMID , which consist of formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution, are performed at our FDA
approved drug product manufacturing facility in Boudry, Switzerland. We have contracted with a number of third-party drug product manufacturing   

  20  

Table of Contents   

  service
providers and packaging service providers to provide backup manufacturing and packaging services. All of our third-party service providers are approved by the regulatory authorities for the
geographies that they serve.   

  The
API for ABRAXANE  is generally available from multiple sources and is normally available in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Manufacturing services for
ABRAXANE  are performed at our manufacturing facility in Arizona and by an approved third party contract manufacturing facility.   

  The
API for VIDAZA  is supplied by two suppliers, and the API for ISTODAX  is supplied by a single-source supplier. Manufacturing and packaging services for these
products are provided by a number of third-party service providers.   

  The
API for POMALYST  is supplied by a single-source supplier with primary manufacturing services being performed at our Boudry manufacturing facility. We expect to utilize third-party
service providers for backup manufacturing and packaging services for this product.   

  The
API for FOCALIN  and FOCALIN XR  is currently obtained from two suppliers, and we rely on a single manufacturer for the tableting and packaging of
FOCALIN  finished product.   

  CCT
currently operates an FDA registered facility in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey for the recovery and storage of cord blood and placental stem cells for LifeBankUSA . In addition, our
Warren, New Jersey facility is FDA registered for production of PDA-001, a culture-expanded placenta-derived stem cell under cGMP to supply clinical studies. This is a multi-purpose
facility capable of supporting other products.   

    INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS     

  We have significant operations outside the United States conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors. Revenues from operations
outside the United States were $2.338 billion, or 42.4% of total revenues in 2012, $1.981 billion, or 40.9% of total revenues in 2011, and $1.437 billion, or 39.6% of total
revenues in 2010. The increase in the percentage of total revenues from outside of the United States is the result of our ongoing efforts to increase the availability of our products to patients
worldwide.   

  Our
international headquarters and a drug product manufacturing facility which performs formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution are located in Boudry, Switzerland. We
continue to expand our international regulatory, clinical and commercial infrastructure and currently conduct our international operations in over 50 countries and have sales in over 70 countries and
regions including Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Asia/Pacific and Canada.   

  Our
international operations are subject to risks associated with operating on an international basis including currency fluctuations, price and exchange controls and other restrictive governmental
actions. Our international operations are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws on pricing, reimbursement and access to our products. Depending on the direction of change
relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While we cannot   

  21  

Table of Contents   

  predict
with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have, we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using foreign currency derivative
instruments. See the discussions under "Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."   

    SALES AND COMMERCIALIZATION     

  We promote our brands globally through our commercial organization which is comprised of highly trained individuals who have significant experience
in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the areas of oncology and immunology. Our commercial organization supports our currently marketed brands and prepares for the launches of new products, as
well as new indications for existing products. We have a team of dedicated market access professionals to help physicians, patients and payers understand the value our products deliver. Given our goal
to ensure that patients who might benefit from our therapies have the opportunity to do so and given the complex reimbursement environment in the United States, we offer the services of Celgene
Patient Support , a dedicated, central point of contact for patients and healthcare professionals who use or prescribe Celgene products. Celgene Patient Support  is a free
service that helps patients and healthcare professionals navigate the challenges of reimbursement, providing information about co-pay assistance and answering questions about obtaining
Celgene products.   

  In
most countries, we sell our products through our own sales organizations. In some countries, particularly in Latin America, we partner with third-party distributors. See the section entitled
"COMMERCIAL STAGE PRODUCTS" above. Generally, we distribute our products through the commonly used channels in local markets. However, REVLIMID , POMALYST , and
THALOMID  are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities' specifications to provide for their safe and
appropriate distribution and use.   

    EMPLOYEES     

  As of December 31, 2012, we had 4,700 full-time employees, of whom 2,020 were engaged primarily in research and development
activities, 1,451 engaged primarily in sales and commercialization activities, 452 engaged primarily in manufacturing, and the remaining 777 engaged primarily in executive and general and
administrative activities. The number of full-time employees in our international operations has grown from 1,654 at the end of 2011 to 1,834 at the end of 2012. We also employ a number of
part-time employees and maintain consulting arrangements with a number of researchers at various universities and other research institutions around the world.

ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORS             

  The following statements describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and
negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results or credit ratings, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The risks described below are
not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect our business, financial
results and operations.   

     We may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results which could cause our financial results to be below expectations and cause our stock price to
be volatile.      

  We have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These fluctuations are
due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, and may result in volatility of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many factors,
including:  

demand or lack of demand for our products, including demand that adversely affects our ability to optimize the use of our
manufacturing facilities;   
           the introduction and pricing of products competitive with ours, including generic competition;    
           developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products;   
           regulatory approvals for our products and pricing determinations with respect to our products;    
           regulatory approvals for our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers;    
           timing and levels of spending for research and development, sales and marketing;    
           timing and levels of reimbursement from third-party payers for our products;    
 
  24  

Table of Contents   

development or expansion of business infrastructure in new clinical and geographic markets;    
           the acquisition of new products and companies;   
           tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;   
           timing and recognition of certain research and development milestones and license fees;    
           ability to control our costs;   
           fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and  
           economic and market instability.    

We are dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary products REVLIMID , VIDAZA , THALOMID  and ABRAXANE , and
a significant decline in demand for or use of these products or our other commercially available products could materially and adversely affect our operating results.      

  During the next several years, the growth of our business will be largely dependent on the commercial success of REVLIMID ,
VIDAZA , THALOMID  and ABRAXANE . We cannot predict the extent to which these or our other existing or new products will be accepted by regulators, physicians,
patients and other key opinion leaders as effective drugs with certain advantages over existing or future therapies. We are continuing to introduce our products in additional international markets and
to obtain approvals for additional indications both in the United States and internationally. A delay in gaining the requisite regulatory approvals for these markets or indications could negatively
impact our growth plans and the value of our stock.   

  Further,
if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of any of our products, physician and patient comfort with the product could be undermined, the commercial success of
such product could be adversely affected and the acceptance of our other products could be negatively impacted. We are subject to adverse event reporting regulations that require us to report to the
Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or similar bodies in other countries if our products are associated with a death or serious injury. These adverse events, among others, could result in additional
regulatory controls, such as the performance of costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved labeling, which could limit the indications or patient population for our
products or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market. Similarly, the occurrence of serious adverse events known or suspected to be related to the products could negatively impact
product sales. For example, THALOMID  is known to be toxic to the human fetus and exposure to the drug during pregnancy could result in significant deformities in the baby.
REVLIMID  is also considered fetal toxic and there are warnings against use of VIDAZA  in pregnant women as well. While we have restricted distribution systems for both
THALOMID  and REVLIMID  and we endeavor to educate patients regarding the potential known adverse events including pregnancy risks, we cannot ensure that all such warnings and
recommendations will be complied with or that adverse events resulting from non-compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business.   

  25  

Table of Contents   

  It
is necessary that our primary products achieve and maintain market acceptance. A number of factors may adversely impact the degree of market acceptance of our products, including the products'
efficacy, safety, price and benefits, if any, over competing products, as well as the reimbursement policies of third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans, patent disputes and
claims about adverse side effects.   

     If we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products we will be unable to sell our current products and products in development.      

  Changes in law, government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The discovery, preclinical
development, clinical trials, manufacturing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our S.T.E.P.S.  and RevAssist  programs), marketing and labeling of
pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Public Health
Service Act, Medicare Modernization Act, Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, and other federal and state statutes, as well as similar laws in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in laws,
government regulations or policies can have a significant adverse impact on our ability to continue to commercialize our products or introduce new products to the market, which would adversely affect
our results of operations.   

  If
we or our agents, contractors or collaborators are delayed in receiving, or are unable to obtain all, necessary governmental approvals, we will be unable to effectively market our products.   

The
testing, marketing and manufacturing of our products requires regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA and, in some cases, from the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, or
governmental authorities outside of the United States that perform roles similar to those of the FDA and EPA, including the EMA, European Commission, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices
Agency, the Swissmedic, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Health Canada. Certain of our pharmaceutical products, such as FOCALIN , fall under the Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 that requires authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, of the U.S. Department of Justice in order to handle and distribute these products.   

The
regulatory approval process presents a number of risks to us, principally:  

In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years, and require the expenditure of substantial
resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;    
           Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical
or other data to demonstrate compliance with a regulatory agency's requirements for safety, efficacy and quality or, in the case of a product seeking an orphan drug indication, because another
designee received approval first or receives approval of other labeled indications;   
           Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new
regulations or legislation;    
 
  26  

Table of Contents   

The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be
marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and contra-indications that could materially affect the sales and profitability of the drug;    
           Approved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to continuing and ongoing review, and discovery of
previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their
withdrawal from the market;   
           Regulatory authorities and agencies of the United States or foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations
restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products, including specifically tailored risk evaluation and mitigation strategies;   
           Guidelines and recommendations published by various governmental and non-governmental organizations can reduce
the use of our products;   
           Once a product receives marketing approval, we may not market that product for broader or different applications, and the
FDA may not grant us approval with respect to separate product applications that represent extensions of our basic technology. In addition, the FDA may withdraw or modify existing approvals in a
significant manner or promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. The FDA may also request that we perform additional clinical trials or change the
labeling of our existing or proposed products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market;   
           Products, such as REVLIMID , that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an expedited
withdrawal if the post-marketing restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to assure the safe use of the drug, or evidence demonstrates that the drug is not shown to be
safe and effective under its conditions of use. Additionally, promotional materials for such products are subject to enhanced surveillance, including pre-approval review of all promotional
materials used within 120 days following marketing approval and a requirement for the submissions 30 days prior to initial dissemination of all promotional materials disseminated after
120 days following marketing approval; and  
           Our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, labeling and promotional activities relating to our products as well as our
post-marketing activities are regulated by the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, the DEA, state regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory
agencies and are subject to associated risks. In addition, individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription
drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. If we fail to comply with regulations regarding the promotion and sale of our products, appropriate distribution of our products under
our restricted distribution systems, off-label promotion and the promotion of unapproved products, such agencies may bring enforcement actions against us that could inhibit our commercial
capabilities as well as result in significant penalties.

  Other
matters that may be the subject of governmental or regulatory action which could adversely affect our business include:  

changes in laws and regulations, including without limitation, patent, environmental, privacy, health care and competition
laws;   
           importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States at prices that are regulated by the governments of
various foreign countries;   
           additional restrictions on interactions with healthcare professionals;
and  
           privacy restrictions that may limit our ability to share data from foreign jurisdictions.    

We
collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our unrelated allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses. The FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research currently regulates human
tissue or cells intended for transplantation, implantation, infusion or transfer to a human recipient under 21 CFR Parts 1270 and 1271. Part 1271 requires cell and tissue establishments
to screen and test donors, to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to register the establishment with FDA. This part also provides for
inspection by the FDA of cell and tissue establishments. Currently, we are required to be, and are, licensed to operate in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California. If other states adopt similar
licensing requirements, we would need to obtain such licenses to continue operating any stem cell banking businesses if we are deemed to be operating in those states. If we are delayed in receiving,
or are unable to obtain at all, necessary licenses, we will be unable to provide services in those states and this could impact negatively on our revenue.   

Sales of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and reimbursement for our products by governmental and other third-party payers is reduced or terminated.      

  Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care,
pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers.
Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, the government-sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of healthcare costs of patients. These health care management
organizations and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the 2010 U.S. Health Care Reform Law, which became effective in
January 2011, has provided sweeping health care reform in the United States, which may impact access to and reimbursement for our products. In addition to the federal legislation, state legislatures
and foreign governments have also shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for
substitution of generic products. The establishment of limitations on patient access to our drugs, adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures in new jurisdictions or
programs, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, including the impact of the 2010 U.S. Health Care Reform Law, could adversely impact our
business and future results. If these organizations and third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not reimburse   

  28  

Table of Contents   

  providers
or consumers of our products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.   

  Our
ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United States depends in part on our relationships with group purchasing organizations, or GPOs. Many existing and potential customers for
our products become members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes on an exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these
negotiated prices are made available to a GPO's affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may
be less likely to purchase our products, and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer's products, we may be
precluded from making sales to members of the GPO for the duration of
that contractual arrangement. Our failure to renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results
of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these contracts at the current or substantially similar terms. If we are unable to keep our relationships and develop new
relationships with GPOs, our competitive position may suffer.   

  We
encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the United States. International operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other
market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on access to and
reimbursement for our products. Although we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future cost-containment measures or other potential legislative or regulatory
developments, additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict access to and reimbursement for our current and future products, which could adversely affect our
revenue and results of operations.   

     Our long-term success depends, in part, on intellectual property protection     .     

  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third
parties and to conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, can be uncertain
and involve complex legal and factual questions including those related to our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our S.T.E.P.S.  and RevAssist  programs). In
addition, the coverage sought in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.   

  Consequently,
we do not know whether any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications, which have not already been allowed, will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are
issued, whether they will be dominated by third-party patent rights, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they will be circumvented, opposed,
invalidated, rendered unenforceable or infringed by others. Further, we are aware of third-party U.S. patents that relate to, for example, the use of certain stem cell technologies and cannot be
certain as to any impact to our potential products, or guarantee that our patents or pending applications will not be involved in, or be defeated as a result of,   

  29  

Table of Contents   

  opposition
proceedings before a foreign patent office or any interference proceedings before the United States Patent   Trademark Office, or PTO.   

  With
respect to patents and patent applications we have licensed-in, there can be no assurance that additional patents will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have licensed
patent rights, or that, if any new patents are issued, such patents will not be opposed, challenged, invalidated, infringed or dominated or provide us with significant proprietary protection or
commercial advantage. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed patents will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Nor can we guarantee that these
licensed patents will not be either infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others, or that the relevant agreements will not be terminated. A termination of material licenses granted to us could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   

  Because
(1) patent applications filed in the United States on or before November 28, 2000 are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, (2) patent applications filed in the
United States on or after November 29, 2000 are not published until approximately 18 months after their earliest claimed priority date, (3) United States patent applications that
are not filed outside the United States may not publish at all until issued and (4) publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we
cannot be certain that we, or our licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each of the issued patents or pending patent applications or that we, or our licensors, were the first to
file patent applications for such inventions. In the event a third party has also filed a patent for any of our inventions, we, or our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings
before the PTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in the loss of a U.S. patent or loss of any opportunity to secure U.S. patent protection for the invention. Even if the eventual
outcome is favorable to us, such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us.   

  Our
intellectual property rights will further be affected in ways that are difficult to anticipate at this time by the provisions of the America Invents Act, signed into law on September 16,
2011. The new patent law is the first major overhaul of the U.S. patent system since 1952, and includes a number of changes to established practices. The most significant changes in the new law
include the transition to a first-to-file system, the availability of new post-grant review for issued patents, various procedural changes, including the submission
of prior art and the availability of derivation proceedings and supplemental examination, and an expanded prior commercial user rights defense to a claim of patent infringement. The scope of these
changes and the lack of experience with their practical implementation, suggest a transitional period with some uncertainty over the
next few years. For example, while some provisions of the new patent law have already taken effect, others will take effect up to 18 months from enactment. The U.S. PTO is still in the process
of publishing regulations concerning the implementation of the law. Several provisions of the new law will likely be tested in courts over time.   

  The
changes in the new U.S. patent law will have an impact on our intellectual property rights and how business is conducted in general. For example, the first-to-file system
places a premium on filing as early as possible and appears to increase what is available as prior art, by changing the applicable definitions. In the future, in addition to patents and printed
publications, we may be required to deal with unfamiliar prior art categories such as art that is "otherwise available to the   

  30  

Table of Contents   

  public."
For patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013, we may expect post-grant review challenges initiated up to nine months after the corresponding patent issues.   

While
the new patent law was intended to make the resolution of intellectual property disputes easier and less expensive, we may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing patents or we
may be required to obtain licenses to such patents. However, we do not know whether such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Prosecution of patent applications,
post-grant opposition proceedings and litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents, to assert patent infringement claims against others and to defend against patent
infringement claims by others can be expensive and time-consuming. There can be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or
more third parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation or
post-grant proceeding could cause us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated by such patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on our business. If a third
party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease using the products or processes covered by the disputed rights, be subject to significant
liabilities to such third party and/or be required to license technologies from such third party. Also, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued by
different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent
covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the
claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the
judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country. Competitors have chosen and in the future may choose to file oppositions to patent applications, which have been
deemed allowable by foreign patent examiners. Furthermore, even if our owned or licensed patents are determined to be valid and enforceable, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able
to challenge the validity or our patent claims in post-grant proceedings, or to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. Additionally, for
these same reasons, we cannot be sure that patents of a broader scope than ours may be issued and thereby create freedom to operate issues. If this occurs we may need to reevaluate pursuing such
technology, which is dominated by others' patent rights, or alternatively, seek a license to practice our own invention, whether or not patented.   

  We
also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside
scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. There can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached, that we would have
adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technological advances will not otherwise become known to others. In addition, there can be no
assurance that, despite precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain access to our proprietary technology or that such technology will not be found to be non-proprietary or
not a trade secret.

     Our products may face competition from lower cost generic or follow-on products and providers of these products may be able to sell them at a substantially lower
cost than us.      

  Generic drug manufacturers are seeking to compete with our drugs and present an important challenge to us. Even if our patent applications, or those
we have licensed-in, are issued, innovative and generic drug manufacturers and other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of such patents in court, requiring us
to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation. Alternatively, innovative and generic drug manufacturers and other competitors may be able to design around our owned or licensed patents and
compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. If any of our issued or licensed patents are infringed or challenged, we may not be successful in enforcing or defending our or our
licensor's intellectual property rights and subsequently may not be able to develop or market the applicable product exclusively.   

Upon
the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the "at-risk" launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a
generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products, we can quickly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product, which can adversely affect our business. In addition, if
generic versions of our competitors' branded products lose their market exclusivity, our patented products may face increased competition which can adversely affect our business.   

  The
FDA approval process allows for the approval of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) application for a generic version of our approved products upon the expiration, through
passage of time or successful legal challenge, of relevant patent or non-patent exclusivity protection. Generic manufacturers pursuing ANDA approvals are not required to conduct costly and
time-consuming clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of their products; rather, they are permitted to rely on the innovator's data regarding safety and efficacy. Thus,
generic manufacturers can sell their products at prices much lower than those charged by the innovative companies who have incurred substantial expenses associated with the research and development of
the drug product. Accordingly, while our products currently may retain certain regulatory and or patent exclusivity, our products are or will be subject to ANDA applications to the FDA in light of the
Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The ANDA procedure includes provisions allowing generic manufacturers to challenge the effectiveness of the innovator's patent
protection prior to the generic manufacturer actually commercializing their products   the so-called "Paragraph IV" certification procedure. In recent years,
generic manufacturers have used Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge the applicability of Orange Book-listed patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals,
and we expect this trend to continue. During the exclusivity periods, the FDA is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an ANDA. Upon the expiration of the applicable exclusivities,
through passage of time or successful legal challenge, the FDA may grant effective approval of an ANDA for a generic drug, or may accept reference to a previously protected NDA in a 505(b)(2)
application. Further, upon such expiration event, the FDA may require a generic competitor to participate in some form of risk management system which could include our participation as well.
Depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities, any such approval could be limited to certain formulations and/or indications/claims, i.e., those not covered by any outstanding
exclusivities.   

  32  

Table of Contents   

  If
an ANDA filer or a 505(b)(2) applicant were to receive approval to sell a generic or follow-on version of one of our products, that product would become subject to increased competition
and our revenues for that product would be adversely affected.   

  We
received two Paragraph IV Certification Letters dated August 30, 2010 and June 12, 2012, respectively, advising us that Natco Pharma Limited of Hyderabad, India, or Natco,
submitted an ANDA to the FDA with respect to REVLIMID . See "Legal Proceedings" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
information.   

     If we are not able to effectively compete our business will be adversely affected.      

  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
Our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms, including, but not limited to:  

Takeda and Johnson   Johnson, which compete with REVLIMID  and THALOMID  in the treatment
of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with our compounds;   
           Eisai, SuperGen and Johnson   Johnson, which compete or may potentially compete with VIDAZA , in
addition Eisai potentially competes with ABRAXANE , and in other oncology products in general;   
           Amgen, which potentially competes with our TNF- a  and kinase inhibitors;    
           AstraZeneca, which potentially competes in clinical trials with our compounds and
TNF- a  inhibitors;   
           Biogen Idec is generally developing drugs that address the oncology and immunology markets;    
           Bristol Myers Squibb, which potentially competes with ABRAXANE , and in clinical trials with our compounds and
TNF- a  inhibitors, in addition to other oncology products in general;   
           F. Hoffman-La Roche, which potentially competes in clinical trials with our
 TNF- a  inhibitors, in addition to other oncology products in general;   
           Johnson   Johnson, Pfizer, and Abbott Laboratories also compete with our oral anti-inflammatory
programs;   
           Novartis, which potentially competes with our compounds and kinase programs;    
           Pfizer, which potentially competes in clinical trials with our kinase inhibitors;
and  
           Sanofi, which competes with ABRAXANE , in addition to other oncology products in general.

  Many of these companies have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. This enables them, among other things, to make greater research and
development investments and spread their research and development costs, as well as their marketing and promotion costs, over a broader revenue base. Our competitors may also have more experience and
expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA, and other regulatory authorities. We also experience competition from universities and other research institutions, and in some instances, we
compete with others in acquiring technology from these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change, and we
expect competition to intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known. The development of products, including generics, or processes by our competitors with
significant advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline.   

     A decline of global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations.      

  Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers,
distribution partners and other organizations. As a result of global credit and financial market conditions, these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay
payment. In addition, U.S. federal and state health authorities may reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, and private insurers may limit access to and reimbursement for our products. A
reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales, revenue and cash flows.   

  See
our discussion of accounts receivable from Spain, Italy and Portugal in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the caption
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" for details related to amounts receivable from the government owned or controlled hospitals in Spain, Italy and Portugal.   

  Due
to tightened global credit, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or collaborators. We rely on third parties for several important aspects
of our business, including portions of our product manufacturing, royalty revenue, clinical development of future collaboration products, conduct of clinical trials and raw materials. If such third
parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business could be adversely affected.   

     We may be required to modify our business practices, pay fines and significant expenses or experience losses due to litigation or governmental investigations.      

  From time to time, we may be subject to litigation or governmental investigation on a variety of matters in the United States or foreign
jurisdictions, including, without limitation, regulatory, intellectual property, product liability, antitrust, consumer, false claims, whistleblower, Qui Tam, privacy, anti-kickback, anti-bribery,
environmental, commercial, securities and employment litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that may arise from the conduct of our business.   

  Our
activities relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Like many companies in our
industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of   

  34  

Table of Contents   

  information
requests from government authorities, and we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities.   

  We
are also subject to significant product liability risks as a result of the testing of our products in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Although we have
insurance coverage with respect to potential product liability claims, there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage will be adequate or continue to be available at sufficient levels to fully
cover claims that may arise in the future.   

  In
the fourth quarter of 2009, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC. The FTC requested documents and other information relating to requests
by generic companies to purchase our patented REVLIMID  and THALOMID  brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to believe that we have engaged in unfair methods
of competition. In the first quarter of 2010, the State of Connecticut referenced the same issues as those referenced in the 2009 CID and issued a subpoena. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received
a second CID from the FTC relating to this matter. We continue to respond to requests for information.   

  In
the first quarter of 2011, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California informed us that they are investigating possible off-label marketing and improper
payments to physicians in connection with the sales of THALOMID  and REVLIMID . In the third quarter of 2012, we learned that two other United States Attorneys' offices (the
Northern District of Alabama and the Eastern District of Texas) and various state Attorneys General are conducting related investigations. We are cooperating with these investigations.   

  While
the ultimate outcome of investigations and legal proceedings are difficult to predict, adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition and result in, among other things:  

rulings that are materially unfavorable to us, including significant damage awards, fines or penalties, and administrative
remedies, such as exclusion and/or debarment from government programs, or other rulings that prevent us from operating our business in a certain manner;    
           changes to our business operations to avoid perceived risks associated with such litigation or investigations;    
           modification of our business practices;   
           product recalls;   
           reputational damage and decreased demand for our products; and  
           expenditure of significant time and resources, which may divert the attention of our management and interfere with the
pursuit of our strategic objectives.    

While
we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to   

  35  

Table of Contents   

  obtain
insurance to protect against all potential risks and liabilities. If any litigation or governmental investigation were to have a material adverse result, there could be a material impact on our
results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. See also "Legal Proceedings" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

     The development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize any of the products we are currently
developing.      

  Many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial
financial resources, extensive research, development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. This process
involves a high degree of risk and takes many years. Our product development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail for many reasons, including the failure of the product candidate in
preclinical studies; adverse patient reactions to the product candidate or indications or other safety concerns; insufficient clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority of the
product candidate; our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner; our
failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate, the facilities or the process used to manufacture the product candidate; or changes in the
regulatory environment, including pricing and reimbursement, that make development of a new product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer desirable. Moreover, our commercially
available products may require additional studies with respect to approved indications as well as new indications pending approval.   

  The
stem cell products that we are developing through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete
with a number of traditional products and therapies which are now, or may be in the future, manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public
attitudes may be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe, and stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community.   

Due
to the inherent uncertainty involved in conducting clinical studies, we can give no assurances that our studies will have a positive result or that we will receive regulatory approvals for our new
products or new indications.   

     Manufacturing and distribution risks including a disruption at certain of our manufacturing and distribution sites, would significantly interrupt our production
capabilities, which could result in significant product delays and adversely affect our results.      

  We have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our products and we have contracted with third-party manufacturers and distributors to provide
active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, encapsulation, finishing services, packaging and distribution services to meet our needs. These operations expose us to risks that include the possibility
that our or our suppliers' manufacturing processes and distribution channels could be partially or completely disrupted by a fire, natural disaster, terrorist attack, governmental action or military
action. In the case of a disruption, we may need to establish alternative manufacturing sources for these products. This would likely lead to substantial production delays as we build or locate
replacement facilities and seek and   

  36  

Table of Contents   

  obtain
the necessary regulatory approvals. If this occurs, and our finished goods inventories are insufficient to meet demand, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis, if at all.
Further, our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur and we would have to bear the uncovered cost of any disruption. For these reasons, a
significant disruptive event affecting these manufacturing facilities or sites could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if we inaccurately predict
market demand for our products, we may be unable to sufficiently increase production capacity to satisfy demand or may incur costs associated with excess inventory that we manufacture.   

In
all the countries where we sell our products, governmental regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and storing. All of our suppliers of raw
materials, contract manufacturers and distributors must comply with these regulations, as applicable. In the United States, the FDA requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve and maintain compliance with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and guidelines. Our failure to
comply, or failure of our third-party manufacturers
to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license
revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In addition, before any
product batch produced by our manufacturers can be shipped, it must conform to release specifications pre-approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical product. If the
operations of one or more of our manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason, any required FDA review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier could cause a delay in the
manufacture of our products.   

  If
our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality, quantity or timeliness, or do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, our ability to continue
supplying such products at a level that meets demand could be adversely affected.   

  We
have contracted with distributors, to distribute REVLIMID , THALOMID , VIDAZA , ABRAXANE  and ISTODAX . If our distributors fail to
perform and we cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable period of time, we may experience adverse effects to our business and results of operations.   

  We
are continuing to establish marketing and distribution capabilities in international markets with respect to our products. At the same time, we are in the process of obtaining necessary
governmental and regulatory approvals to sell our products in certain countries. If we have not successfully completed and implemented adequate marketing and distribution support services upon our
receipt of such approvals, our ability to effectively launch our products in these countries would be severely restricted.   

  37  

Table of Contents   

     The consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions could increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.      

  We sell our pharmaceutical products in the United States primarily through wholesale distributors and contracted pharmacies. These wholesale
customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation. As a
result, a smaller number of large wholesale distributors and pharmacy chains control a significant share of the market. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains will
increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us. In addition, wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through fee-for-service
arrangements, and their purchases may exceed customer demand, resulting in reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters. We cannot assure you that we can manage these pressures or that wholesaler
purchases will not decrease as a result of this potential excess buying.   

     Risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents or contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation.      

  We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees,
agents, contractors or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including without limitation, employment, foreign corrupt practices,
environmental, competition and privacy laws. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties and could adversely impact our ability to
conduct business, our results of operations and our reputation.   

     The integration of acquired businesses may present significant challenges to us.      

  We may face significant challenges in effectively integrating entities and businesses that we may acquire and we may not realize the benefits
anticipated from such acquisitions. Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquired businesses will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner.
Our integration of acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:  

demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition;    
           the diversion of management's attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;    
           higher integration costs than anticipated;   
           failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;   
           difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;    
 
  38  

Table of Contents   

difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and
geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and  
           difficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records,
and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related procedures and
policies.    

If
we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Successful integration of
acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage these operations, to
realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by product offerings and expanded geographic market coverage and, to some degree, to eliminate redundant and excess costs.   

     An inability to continue to attract and retain key leadership, managerial, commercial and scientific talent could adversely affect our business.      

  The success of our business depends, in large part, on our continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly qualified management,
scientific, manufacturing and commercial personnel, (ii) successfully integrate large numbers of new employees into our corporate culture and (iii) develop and maintain important
relationships with leading research and medical institutions and key distributors. Competition for these types of personnel and relationships is intense.   

  Among
other benefits, we use share-based compensation to attract and retain personnel. Share-based compensation accounting rules require us to recognize all share-based compensation costs as expenses.
These or other factors could reduce the number of share-based compensation awards we grant under our incentive plan. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled personnel or
maintain key relationships, or that the costs of retaining such personnel or maintaining such relationships will not materially increase.   

     We could be subject to significant liability as a result of risks associated with using hazardous materials in our business.      

We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development, manufacturing and general business activities. While we believe we are currently in
substantial compliance with the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use of these materials, we cannot be certain that accidental injury or contamination will not occur. If an
accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup
obligations, damages and fines. This could result in substantial liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with environmental
and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage.   

     Changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.      

  We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are
largely dependent upon the distribution of   

  39  

Table of Contents   

  income
among these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations
of existing tax laws, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development spending, changes in accounting
standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other jurisdictions, the accuracy
of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax assets, and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The impact on our income tax provision resulting
from the above-mentioned factors and others may be significant and could have an impact on our results of operations.   

     Currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline.      

  We collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and expenditures in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates affect our operating results.   

  We
utilize foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts, which are derivative instruments, to manage foreign currency risk, but not to engage in currency speculation. We use these
derivative instruments to hedge certain forecasted transactions and balance sheet exposures denominated in foreign currencies. The use of these derivative instruments is intended to mitigate the
exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost, but may not fully offset any change in operating results as a consequence of fluctuations in foreign currencies. Any significant
foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see Part II,
Item 8, Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

     We may experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet our financial reporting obligations.      

  As we continue to expand at a rapid pace, the development of new and/or improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority. During this
expansion period, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting. Such misstatements may result in litigation and/or negative
publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock.   

     The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you may lose some or all of your investment in us.      

  The market for our shares of common stock may be subject to conditions that cause prices to fluctuate significantly. The following key factors may
have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock:  

results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our marketed products;    
           fluctuations in our commercial and operating results;    
 
  40  

Table of Contents   

announcements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors;    
           market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular;    
           stock market conditions generally;   
           changes in governmental regulations and laws, including, without limitation, changes in tax laws, health care legislation,
environmental laws, competition laws, and patent laws;   
           new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;   
           public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of the disease states that we are targeting;    
           patent or proprietary rights developments;   
           changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for our products;    
           the outcome of litigation involving our products or processes related to production and formulation of those products or
uses of those products;   
           other litigation or governmental investigations;   
           competition; and  
           investor reaction to announcements regarding business or product acquisitions.    

In
addition, our operations may be materially impacted by conditions affecting global markets generally. Global markets may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control, including global,
regional and industrial economic instability and market volatility, sovereign debt issues, rising interest rates or inflation, terrorism or political uncertainty. A market downturn in general and/or
in the biopharmaceutical sector in particular, may adversely affect the market price of our securities, which may not necessarily reflect the actual or perceived value of our company.   

Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to service our obligations under our incurred indebtedness.      

  We have incurred various forms of indebtedness including senior notes, commercial paper, and a senior unsecured credit facility. Our ability to pay
interest, principal amounts when due at maturity, to comply with debt covenants or to repurchase the senior notes if a change of control occurs will depend upon, among other things, continued
commercial success of our products and other factors that affect our future financial and operating performance, including, without limitation, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business,
and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond our control.   

  41  

Table of Contents   

  If
we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the debt service requirements under our incurred indebtedness, we may be forced to take actions such as:  

restructuring or refinancing our debt;   
           seeking additional debt or equity capital;   
           reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, including research and
development expenditures; or  
           selling assets, businesses, products or other potential revenue streams.    

Such
measures might not be successful and might not enable us to service our obligations under our indebtedness. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available
on economically favorable terms, if at all.   

     A breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.      

  We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them
potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be
exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance
that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.   

     We have certain charter and by-law provisions that may deter a third-party from acquiring us and may impede the stockholders' ability to remove and replace our
management or board of directors.      

  Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and
to determine the price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
Additionally, our by-laws contain provisions intended to strengthen the board's position in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders' ability
to remove and replace our management and/or board of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an
anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer of our common stock.   

     In addition to the risks relating to our common stock, holders of our contingent value right, or CVRs, are subject to additional risks.      

  On October 15, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis and in connection with our acquisition, CVRs, were issued
under a CVR Agreement entered into between us and American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC, as trustee. Pursuant to the CVR Agreement, each holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a     pro rata    portion, based on the number of CVRs then outstanding, of certain milestone and net sales payments if certain   

  42  

Table of Contents   

  specified
conditions are satisfied. For more information, see Part II, Item 8, Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.   

  In
addition to the risks relating to our common stock, CVR holders are subject to additional risks, including:  

an active public market for the CVRs may not continue to exist or the CVRs may trade at low volumes, both of which could
have an adverse effect on the resale price, if any, of the CVRs;   
           in the absence of an active public market for the CVRs, the market price and trading volume of the CVRs may be volatile;    
           if the clinical approval milestones specified in the CVR Agreement are not achieved for any reason within the time periods
specified therein, and if net sales do not exceed the thresholds set forth in the CVR Agreement for any reason within the time periods specified therein, no payment will be made under the CVRs and the
CVRs will expire valueless;   
           since the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the CVRs is unclear, any part of any CVR payment could be treated as
ordinary income and required to be included in income prior to the receipt of the CVR payment;   
           any payments in respect of the CVRs are subordinated to the right of payment of certain of our other indebtedness;    
           we may under certain circumstances redeem the CVRs; and  
           upon expiration of our obligations to achieve each of the CVR milestones and to commercialize ABRAXANE  or any
of the other Abraxis pipeline products, we may discontinue such efforts, which would have an adverse effect on the value, if any, of the CVRs.

We
occupy the following facilities, located in the United States, under operating lease arrangements, none of which are individually material to us. Under these lease arrangements, we may be required
to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. All leases are with unaffiliated parties.   

We
also lease a number of offices under various lease agreements outside of the United States for which the minimum annual rents may be subject to specified annual rent increases. At
December 31, 2012, the non-cancelable lease terms for our operating leases expire at various dates between 2013 and 2023 and in some cases include renewal options. The total amount
of rent expense recorded for all leased facilities in 2012 was $35.4 million.    

ITEM 3.         LEGAL PROCEEDINGS             

  We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, trademark, commercial and other claims; government investigations; and other legal
proceedings that arise from time to time   

  44  

Table of Contents   

  in
the ordinary course of business. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities,
and we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations and legal proceedings are difficult to predict, adverse
resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, product recalls, incurrence of costs and payment of significant penalties, which
may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.   

  Pending
patent proceedings include challenges to the scope, validity or enforceability of our patents relating to certain of our products or processes. Although we believe we have substantial defenses
to these challenges with respect to all our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection
for the drug at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations.   

Among
the principal matters pending to which we are a party are the following:   

  In
the fourth quarter of 2009, we received a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC. The FTC requested documents and other information relating to
requests by generic companies to purchase our patented REVLIMID  and THALOMID  brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to believe that we have engaged in
unfair methods of competition. In the first quarter of 2010, the State of Connecticut referenced the same issues as those referenced in the 2009 CID and issued a subpoena. In the fourth quarter of
2010, we received a second CID from the FTC relating to this matter. We continue to respond to requests for information.   

In
the first quarter of 2011, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California informed us that they are investigating possible off-label marketing and improper
payments to physicians in connection with the sales of THALOMID  and REVLIMID . In the third quarter of 2012, we learned that two other United States Attorneys' offices (the
Northern District of Alabama and the Eastern District of Texas) and various state Attorneys General are conducting related investigations. We are cooperating with these investigations.   

    REVLIMID :       We have publicly announced that we received a Notice Letter dated August 30, 2010, sent from Natco Pharma Limited of India ("Natco")
notifying us of Natco's Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, which contains Paragraph IV certifications against certain of Celgene's patents that are listed in the U.S. Federal Drug
Administration's, or FDA,    Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations    (the "Orange Book") for REVLIMID  (lenalidomide).
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA containing a certification (a "Paragraph IV certification") challenging the validity or infringement of a patent
listed in the Orange Book. Natco's Notice letter alleges, among other things, that certain claims of United States Patent Nos. 5,635,517 (the "'517 patent"), 6,045,501 (the "'501 patent"),
6,315,720 (the "'720 patent"), 6,555,554 (the "'554 patent"), 6,561,976 (the "'976 patent"), 6,561,977 (the "'977 patent"), 6,755,784 (the "'784 patent"), 7,119,106 (the "'106 patent") and 7,465,800
(the "800 patent") are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed. Natco's Notice Letter was sent in connection with its filing of an ANDA seeking permission from the FDA to market a generic version
of 25mg, 15mg, 10mg and 5mg REVLIMID  capsules.   

  45  

Table of Contents   

  On
October 8, 2010, we filed an infringement action in the United States District Court of New Jersey against Natco in response to the Notice Letter with respect to the '517 patent, the '501
patent, United States Patent No. 6,281,230 (the "'230 patent"), the '720 patent, the '554 patent, the '976 patent, the '977 patent, the '784 patent, the '106 patent and the '800 patent.   

  Natco
responded to our infringement action on November 18, 2010, with its Answer, Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims. Natco has alleged (through Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims) that
the patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed by Natco's proposed generic products. After filing the infringement action, we learned the identity of Natco's U.S. partner, Arrow
International Limited ("Arrow"), and filed an amended complaint on January 7, 2011, adding Arrow as a defendant. On March 25, 2011, We filed a second amended complaint naming Natco,
Arrow and Watson Laboratories, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Actavis, Inc. (formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which is Arrow's parent) as defendants. Those
three entities remain the current defendants in that action.   

  On
June 12, 2012, we received a Second Notice Letter from Natco, notifying us of Natco's submission in its ANDA of new, additional Paragraph IV certifications against the '517 patent,
the '230 patent and United States Patent Nos. 7,189,740 (the "'740 patent"), 7,855,217 (the "'217 patent") and 7,968,569 (the "'569 patent"). On July 20, 2012, we filed a new
infringement action in the United States District Court of New Jersey against Natco, Arrow, Watson Laboratories, Inc. and Actavis, Inc. in response to the Second Notice Letter with
respect to the '517 patent, the '230 patent, the '740 patent, and the '569 patent, as well as two non-Orange Book listed patents, United States Patent Nos. 7,977,357 (the "'357
patent") and 8,193,219 (the "'219 patent"). Natco filed its Answer and Counterclaims on September 28, 2012. Natco's counterclaims in the second action are similar to its counterclaims in the
first action. In the second action, Natco added counterclaims against United States Patent No. 8,204,763 (the "'763 patent"), which Celgene has not asserted against Natco. Celgene has moved to
dismiss those counterclaims related to the '763 patent for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   

A
revised Scheduling Order was entered by the Court on November 9, 2012, setting the close for fact discovery on August 14, 2013. A Markman hearing is currently expected to be fully
briefed by the end of July 2013. Dates for a Markman hearing and trial have yet to be set.   

  We
believe that Natco's defenses and counterclaims are unlikely to be sustained and we intend to vigorously defend our patent rights. We believe it unlikely that Natco will prevail on each and every
patent and patent claim subject to the lawsuits, and that all of the patent claims will be deemed to be invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome is not expected
to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   

  However,
if Natco is successful in challenging our patents, and the FDA were to approve Natco's ANDA with a comprehensive education and risk management program for a generic version of lenalidomide
and a generic product were to be introduced, sales of REVLIMID  could be significantly reduced in the United States, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition.   

    ABRAXANE :       On December 14, 2011, Cephalon, Inc. and Acusphere, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging, among other things, that the making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing of ABRAXANE    

  46  

Table of Contents   

  brand
drug infringes claims of United States Patent No. RE40,493. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. We intend to vigorously defend against this infringement suit. If the suit
against us is successful, we may have to pay damages, ongoing royalties and may have to license rights from plaintiffs. However, we believe that (a) it is unlikely that the plaintiffs in this
matter will prevail and (b) the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   

    VIDAZA :       On September 28, 2012, we were named as a defendant in a complaint filed by Ivax LLC (formerly Ivax Corporation) in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Ivax LLC alleges that we have infringed the claims of United States Patent No. 7,759,481 by making, using, and selling
VIDAZA  brand drug in the United States. We filed an answer to this complaint on October 19, 2012. We filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on November 15, 2012, to
which Ivax LLC filed an opposition on December 7, 2012. We intend to vigorously defend against this infringement suit. If the suit against us is successful, we may have to pay damages,
ongoing royalties or license rights from the plaintiff. However, we believe (a) that it is unlikely that the plaintiff in this matter will prevail and (b) that the ultimate outcome will
not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 7.         MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS             

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY     

  Celgene Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, "we," "our," "us," "Celgene" or the "Company") is a global biopharmaceutical company
primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory related diseases. We are dedicated to innovative research
and development, designed to bring new therapies to market and are involved in research in several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, targeting areas
such as intracellular signaling pathways in cancer and immune cells, immunomodulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases, and therapeutic application of cell therapies. Celgene was incorporated in the
State of Delaware in 1986.   

  Our
primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID , VIDAZA , ABRAXANE , THALOMID  (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene ), and
ISTODAX . POMALYST  (pomalidomide) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2013 for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least
two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.   

REVLIMID  is an oral immunomodulatory drug marketed in the United States and many international markets, in
combination with dexamethasone, for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. It is also marketed in the United States and certain international markets
for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic
abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.   
           VIDAZA  is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation
and promote subsequent gene re-expression. VIDAZA  is a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS,
according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and is marketed in the United States for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS. The U.S. regulatory exclusivity for VIDAZA  expired
in May 2011. If a generic version of VIDAZA  is successfully launched, we may quickly lose a significant portion of our sales for this product in the United States. In Europe,
VIDAZA  is marketed for the treatment of intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, as well as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, with 30% blasts and has been granted orphan
drug designation for the treatment of MDS and AML. European regulatory exclusivity is expected to continue through 2018.   
           ABRAXANE  is a solvent-free chemotherapy treatment option for metastatic breast cancer which was
developed using our proprietary nab  technology platform. This protein-bound chemotherapy agent combines paclitaxel with albumin. It is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer in the United States and many international markets and for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in the United States. In January 2013, we announced the results from a
phase III trial for ABRAXANE  in    
 
  51  

Table of Contents   

combination
with gemcitabine in treatment-na ve patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The ABRAXANE  combination demonstrated a statistically significant
improvement in overall survival compared to patients receiving gemcitabine alone. Based on these results, we plan to submit dossiers for registration in the U.S. and Europe during the first half of
2013 followed by submissions in other countries and regions during the second half of 2013. ABRAXANE  is currently in various stages of investigation for the treatment of the following
cancers: expanded applications for metastatic breast; malignant melanoma; and bladder and ovarian. In October 2012, the FDA approved ABRAXANE  for the first-line treatment of
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. The FDA
approval was based on tumor response rates and did not result in the use of a marketing label that
includes a progression-free survival claim, and accordingly, the Contingent Value Rights, or CVR, milestone payment, as described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, has not been achieved.   

THALOMID , in combination with dexamethasone, is marketed for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
and for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, an inflammatory complication of leprosy and as maintenance therapy for prevention
and suppression of the cutaneous manifestation of ENL recurrence.   
           ISTODAX  is approved in the United States for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL,
in patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy and for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, in patients who have received at least one prior therapy.
ISTODAX  has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphomas, which includes CTCL and PTCL. The European Medicines Agency, or
EMA, has granted orphan drug designation for ISTODAX  for the treatment of both CTCL and PTCL.   
           POMALYST  (pomalidomide) was approved by the FDA in February 2013 for patients with multiple myeloma who have
received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy, and is under
review by the EMA for use in Europe. POMALYST  is a proprietary, distinct, small molecule that is administered orally and modulates the immune system and other biologically important
targets. POMALYST  is also being evaluated in a phase III clinical trial for the treatment of myelofibrosis, in multiple trials in various phases for expanded usage in multiple
myeloma, and in a phase II trial for systemic sclerosis.    

Additional
sources of revenue include royalties from Novartis on their sales of FOCALIN XR  and the entire RITALIN  family of drugs, the sale of services through our Celgene
Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary, and other licensing agreements.   

  We
continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing clinical proprietary development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug
candidates. REVLIMID is in several phase III trials across a range of hematological   

  52  

Table of Contents   

  malignancies
that include newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and maintenance, lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and MDS. Phase III trials with POMALYST  in relapsed
refractory multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis, in addition to VIDAZA for AML, and CC-486 for MDS and AML are also underway. In solid tumors, we are evaluating ABRAXANE in a
phase III trial for metastatic melanoma. Our lead product candidate in Inflammation   Immunology, apremilast, is being evaluated in a broad phase III program for psoriatic
arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.   

  Beyond
our phase III programs is a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel therapies addressing significant unmet medical needs, including
CC-292 (BTK inhibitor), CC-223 (dual TORK inhibitor), CC-115 (dual TORK/DNA PK inhibitor), CC-122 (pleiotropic pathway modulator), CC-220
and CC-11050 (anti-inflammatory), PDA-001 and PDA-002 (cellular therapies), in addition to partnered molecules ACE-011 (ActR fusion
protein), ACE-536 (GDF trap), and EPZ-5676 (DOT1L inhibitor).   

  We
believe that continued acceptance of our primary commercial stage products, participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, regulatory approvals
of new products, and expanded use of existing products will provide the catalysts for future growth.   

  The
following table summarizes total revenue and earnings for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data):   

Revenue
increased by $664.6 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of REVLIMID , VIDAZA  and ABRAXANE  in both U.S.
and international markets. The $138.0 million increase in net income and $0.45 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2012 compared to 2011 reflected a higher level of net product sales,
reduction in amortization of acquired intangible assets, primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized at the end of 2011, and a decrease in cost of goods sold resulting from the
2011 inclusion of inventory step-up amortization for sales of ABRAXANE . These favorable items were partly offset by an increase in the fair value of our liability related to
publicly traded CVRs that were issued as part of the acquisition of Abraxis, increase in payments related to research and development collaboration arrangements and increase in marketing activity,
primarily related to prelaunch expenses for POMALYST  and ABRAXANE  for new indications.

    Results of Operations:     

    Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010     

Total Revenue:       Total revenue and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands,
except per share data):   

Total
revenue increased by $664.6 million, or 13.7%, to $5.507 billion in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting increases of $309.1 million, or 10.8%, in the United States, and
$355.5 million, or 17.9%, in international markets. The $1.216 billion, or 33.5%, increase in 2011 compared to 2010 included increases of $672.4 million, or 30.7%, in the United
States and $544.0 million, or 37.8%, in international markets.   

    Net Product Sales:       Total net product sales for 2012 increased by $685.9 million, or 14.6%, to $5.386 billion compared to 2011. The increase was
comprised of net volume increases of $559.1 million and price increases of $162.2 million, partly offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $35.4 million. The
increase in price was primarily due to price increases on REVLIMID , VIDAZA  and THALOMID  in the U.S. market.   

  Total
net product sales for 2011 increased by $1.191 billion, or 34.0%, to $4.7 billion compared to 2010. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.157 billion,
price decreases of $4.9 million and a favorable impact from foreign exchange of $38.7 million. The decrease in prices was primarily due to increased Medicare Part D Coverage Gap
rebates resulting from the Health Care Reform Act and an increase in rebates to U.S. and international governments resulting from their attempts to reduce health care costs, partly offset by product
price increases.   

  REVLIMID 
net sales increased by $558.5 million, or 17.4%, to $3.767 billion in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international
markets. Increases in market penetration, treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID  in multiple myeloma and   

  54  

Table of Contents   

  price
contributed to U.S. growth. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains.   

Net
sales of REVLIMID  increased by $739.0 million, or 29.9%, to $3.208 billion in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international
markets. Increased treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID  in multiple myeloma and an increase in market penetration contributed to U.S. growth. The growth in international markets
reflects the expansion of our commercial activities in addition to product reimbursement approvals and the launch of REVLIMID  in Japan in the latter part of 2010.   

  VIDAZA 
net sales increased by $117.9 million, or 16.7%, to $823.2 million in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting increases in both U.S. and international markets. The U.S.
growth reflects an increase in volume and price. The growth in international markets was partly due to the increase in treatment duration of patients using VIDAZA  and launches of
VIDAZA  in new markets, including the United Kingdom and Japan. VIDAZA  retains orphan drug exclusivity in Europe through the end of 2018 and in Japan until January 2021.   

  Net
sales of VIDAZA  increased by $171.0 million, or 32.0%, to $705.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010, with sales increases in both U.S. and international markets. The
growth in the U.S. was the result of increased volume and price. The growth in international markets was primarily due to the increase in treatment duration of patients using VIDAZA  and
product launches in multiple markets, including the United Kingdom and Japan.   

  ABRAXANE 
net sales increased by $40.8 million, or 10.6%, to $426.7 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increased unit volumes in both U.S. and international
markets, reflecting increased acceptance of the product in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and the October 2012 approval for NSCLC.   

  Net
sales of ABRAXANE  increased by $314.5 million to $385.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the inclusion of a full year of sales in 2011 compared to the
2.5 month period in 2010 subsequent to the acquisition of Abraxis.   

  THALOMID 
net sales decreased by $36.9 million, or 10.9%, to $302.1 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower unit volumes in the United States, partly
resulting from the increased use of REVLIMID , partially offset by an increase in price and lower gross to net adjustments.   

Net
sales of THALOMID  decreased by $50.5 million, or 13.0%, to $339.1 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to lower unit volumes in the United States.   

  ISTODAX 
net sales increased by $19.1 million, or 61.7%, to $50.0 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increased unit sales in the treatment of CTCL and the
June 2011 FDA approval of ISTODAX  for the treatment of PTCL in patients who have received at least one prior therapy.   

  Net
sales of ISTODAX  increased by $15.1 million, or 95.9%, to $30.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010. ISTODAX  was launched for the treatment of CTCL in March of
2010 and was   

  55  

Table of Contents   

  approved
by the FDA for the treatment of PTCL in June 2011 in patients who have received at least one prior therapy.   

  The
"other" net product sales category decreased by $13.4 million, or 44.1%, to $17.0 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the April 2011 sale of Abraxis
non-core assets, resulting in the elimination of future Abraxis non-core product sales. Sales of Abraxis non-core products totaled $21.3 million in 2011.   

"Other"
net product sales in 2011 primarily included $21.3 million in Abraxis non-core product sales, $5.4 million in sales of non-core Pharmion products to be
exited and $1.3 million in sales of FOCALIN .   

    Collaborative Agreements and Other Revenue:       Revenue from collaborative agreements and other sources decreased by $8.8 million to $10.7 million in
2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a $6.3 million milestone payment received in 2011 related to VIDAZA  and a $2.4 million reduction in certain
manufacturing and management fees received in 2012.   

  Revenue
from collaborative agreements and other sources increased by $9.0 million to $19.5 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the $6.3 million milestone payment
received in February 2011 related to the approval of VIDAZA  in Japan and a $2.2 million increase in certain manufacturing and management fees received in 2011.   

    Royalty Revenue:       Royalty revenue decreased by $12.5 million to $110.4 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to reduced royalties earned
from Novartis based upon its sales of RITALIN , which was negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets, partly offset by an increase in royalties from sales of FOCALIN
XR .   

  Royalty
revenue increased by $16.1 million to $122.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in royalties earned from Novartis based upon its sales of FOCALIN
XR  and the entire RITALIN  family of drugs. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in residual payments earned by us from the ALKERAN  revenues of
GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK.   

    Gross to Net Sales Accruals:       We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and
distributor service fees.   

  REVLIMID 
is distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the RevAssist  program, which is a proprietary risk-management
distribution program tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID . Internationally, REVLIMID  is distributed under mandatory
risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities' specifications to provide for the product's safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs
may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail
pharmacies. THALOMID  is distributed in the United States under our proprietary "   System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety,"   
or S.T.E.P.S. , program which is a comprehensive education and risk-management distribution program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution
and use of THALOMID . Internationally, THALOMID  is distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities'
specifications to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of THALOMID . These programs may vary by country and,   

  56  

Table of Contents   

  depending
upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. VIDAZA , ABRAXANE  and
ISTODAX  are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as
REVLIMID  and THALOMID .   

  We
base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history
and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as
applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination
is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer
eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical
return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. As noted above, REVLIMID  is distributed primarily through
hospitals and contracted pharmacies, lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity. THALOMID  is
drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a result, wholesalers do not stock the product.   

  Sales
discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.   

  Government
rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are
generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare
Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations
is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We have also analyzed actual billings received from certain states to further support the
accrual rates. Subsequent to implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the 2010 U.S. Health Care
Reform Law, certain states have not yet submitted actual Medicaid Managed Care Organization bills, resulting in an increasing accrual balance. Effective January 1, 2011, manufacturers of
pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this
coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical
invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as incurred. In addition, certain international markets have government-sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program
specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.   

  Rebates
or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices.   

  57  

Table of Contents   

  Settlement
of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical
redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related
to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.   

  Chargeback
accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally
qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S.
Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health
benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.   

  See
Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies below for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.   

Gross
to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in thousands):   

58  

Table of Contents    

  A comparison of provisions for allowances for sales within each of the four categories noted above for 2012 and 2011 follows:   

    2012 compared to 2011:       Returns and allowances decreased by $9.3 million in 2012 compared 2011, primarily due to the reversal of approximately
$7.5 million in reserves established for certain products with quality issues which were resolved in 2012 and lower returns experience on all products, partially offset by a $7.6 million
increase in the returns allowance related to increased levels of VIDAZA  inventory held by distributors at the end of 2012.   

Discounts
increased by $8.8 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to revenue increases in the U.S. and international markets, both of which offer different discount programs, and
expansion into new international markets. These amounts were partly offset by rebates related to VIDAZA  sales in the Japanese market being included in the chargebacks and distributor
service fees category in 2012.   

  Government
rebates increased by $8.7 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase of approximately $15.8 million in rebates related to various U.S. programs, partly
offset by a $7.0 million decrease in rebates in certain international markets. The U.S. programs increase was primarily attributable to volume increases and the refinement of accrual rates for
Medicaid Managed Care Organizations and Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. The decrease in government rebates of $7.0 million in international markets was primarily driven by the refinement
of select government rebates during the third quarter of 2012.   

  Chargebacks
and distributor service fees increased by $16.3 million in 2012 compared to 2011. Chargebacks increased by approximately $2.8 million primarily due to higher sales volumes.
Distributor service fees increased by approximately $13.5 million, primarily due to $8.3 million in service fees associated with higher sales of ABRAXANE  , and
$7.7 million of rebates related to VIDAZA  sales in the Japanese market which were included within discounts during the 2011 period. The increases were partly offset by a
$4.1 million decrease in TRICARE rebates, reflecting lower utilization of THALOMID .   

    2011 compared to 2010:       Returns and allowances increased by $10.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010, including approximately $7.7 million related to
provisions for products with quality issues from contract manufacturers.   

  Discounts
increased by $3.1 million in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to revenue increases in the United States and international markets, both of which offer discount programs, and
expansion into new international markets.   

  Government
rebates increased by $69.0 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $52.5 million in rebate rates in certain international markets
and $23.9 million in increased costs associated with the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap, partly offset by a $5.4 million benefit related to a refinement of prior year estimates for
Medicaid Managed Care Organizations.   

  Chargebacks
and distributor service fees increased by $70.2 million in 2011 compared to 2010. Chargebacks increased by $33.3 million, including $23.2 million related to the
inclusion of ABRAXANE  sales in 2011 and $8.8 million related to sales of VIDAZA , which included   

  59  

Table of Contents   

  $2.1 million
related to disputed claims from 2010. Distributor service fees increased by $36.9 million, including $22.8 million in service fees primarily attributable to sales of
ABRAXANE , $7.8 million in rebates related to the launch of VIDAZA  in Japan and a $3.6 million increase in TRICARE rebates.   

Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets):       Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):   

Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets):       Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased by
$126.7 million to $299.1 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the 2011 inclusion of the following items: a $90.3 million inventory
step-up amortization adjustment related to sales of ABRAXANE , an aggregate $13.2 million in costs related to the sale of non-core Abraxis products which
were divested in April 2011, $8.6 million in higher costs related to former Pharmion products to be exited and a $15.3 million higher allocation of prepaid royalties related to sales of
VIDAZA . These items were partly offset by an increase in 2012 product material costs resulting from a higher level of sales activity. As a percent of net product sales,
cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 5.6% in 2012 compared to 9.1% in 2011. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization for
ABRAXANE , the cost of goods sold ratio in 2011 was 7.1%. The cost of goods sold ratio in 2012 was favorably impacted by 0.3% from a reduction in prepaid royalties expensed in 2012 related
to sales of VIDAZA  and lower cost products, such as REVLIMID , comprising a larger portion of total net sales.   

Cost
of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $119.3 million to $425.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to the
inclusion in 2011 of a $90.3 million inventory step-up amortization adjustment related to sales of ABRAXANE  subsequent to the acquisition of Abraxis compared to a
$34.7 million step-up amortization adjustment included in 2010. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to an increase in material costs resulting from a higher level of
sales activity. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased to 9.1% in 2011 compared to 8.7% in 2010 primarily due to the
inventory step-up amortization adjustment for ABRAXANE . Excluding the step-up amortization adjustments in both years, the cost of goods sold ratios were 7.1% and
7.7% in 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

    Research and Development:       Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid
to clinical research organizations, supplies and upfront and milestone payments resulting from collaboration arrangements.

Table of Contents   

  Research
and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):   

Research and Development:       Research and development expenses increased by $123.9 million to $1.724 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was
primarily due to a $31.9 million increase in payments related to research and development collaboration arrangements, an
increase in 2012 research and development project spending in support of multiple programs across a broad range of diseases and the inclusion of Avila expenses incurred subsequent to the March 2012
acquisition date. The expense for 2012 also includes a $53.4 million in-process research and development, or IPR D, asset impairment charge related to ISTODAX  for PTCL
in Europe and a $69.2 million impairment related to an adjustment to the probability weighted forecasted sales of CC-292 compared to prior estimates.   

  Research
and development expenses increased by $471.8 million to $1.600 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in 2011 was partly due to an increase of $230.1 million
related to the Abraxis business, including a $118.0 million impairment charge related to the IPR D acquired intangible asset. The impairment charge resulted from a change in the probability of
obtaining progression-free survival labeling for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer for ABRAXANE  in the United States. The remainder of the increase was
primarily due to an increase in research and development project spending in support of multiple programs across a broad range of diseases, with late stage clinical trials completing enrollment during
2011. Expenses for 2011 also included $128.5 million in upfront payments related to research and development collaboration arrangements, a $20.0 million payment to Agios for a one year
extension of our collaboration agreement and $14.5 million in milestone payments.

  We make significant investments in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical proprietary development programs which support
both our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. REVLIMID is in several phase III trials across a range of hematological malignancies that include newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma and maintenance, lymphomas, CLL, and non-deletion 5q MDS. Phase III trials for POMALYST  in myelofibrosis, in addition to VIDAZA in AML, and CC-486
for MDS and AML are also underway. In solid tumors, we continue to evaluate ABRAXANE in a phase III trial for metastatic melanoma and have recently completed a phase III trial for
ABRAXANE  in pancreatic cancer. Our lead product candidate
in Inflammation   Immunology, apremilast, is being evaluated in broad phase III programs for psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.   

  Beyond
our phase III programs is a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel therapies addressing significant unmet medical needs, including
CC-292 (BTK inhibitor), CC-223 (dual TORK inhibitor), CC-115 (dual TORK/DNA PK inhibitor), CC-122 (pleiotropic pathway modulator), CC-220
and CC-11050 (anti-inflammatory), PDA-001 and PDA-002 (cellular therapies), in addition to partnered molecules ACE-011 (ActR fusion
protein), ACE-536 (GDF trap), and EPZ-5676 (DOT1L inhibitor).   

  We
do not collect costs on a project basis or for any category of projects for the majority of costs involved in carrying out research projects. While we do perform cost calculations to facilitate our
internal evaluation of individual projects, these calculations include significant estimations and allocations that are not relevant to, or included in, our external financial reporting mechanisms. As
a consequence, we do not report research and development costs at the project level.

Selling, General and Administrative:       Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include salary and benefit costs for employees included in our sales,
marketing, finance, legal and administrative organizations, costs related to the launch of new products or those approved for new indications, outside legal and professional services, donations to
non-profit foundations and facilities costs.

  Selling,
general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased by $147.2 million to $1.374 billion in 2012 compared to 2011, partly due to a $72.0 million increase in donations to
non-profit foundations, a $6.1 million increase in allowances for doubtful accounts related to our European operations and increased marketing activities related to the prelaunch of
ABRAXANE  for first-line treatment of advanced NSCL in the United States and prelaunch activities for POMALYST  globally.   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased by $275.7 million to $1.226 billion in 2011 compared to 2010, partly due to higher marketing and sales-related expenses resulting
from ongoing product launch activities, including REVLIMID  in Japan, preparation for the filing and launch of REVLIMID  in China,
ISTODAX  in PTCL in the United States and ABRAXANE  in the United States and Europe. In addition, 2011 included an increase of $72.1 million in expenses related to the
Abraxis business, resulting from a full year's expense being included in 2011.   

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets:       Amortization of intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations is summarized below for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):   

Amortization
of acquired intangible assets decreased by $94.7 million to $194.5 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to certain Pharmion intangible assets becoming fully
amortized at the end of 2011, which reduced amortization expense by $155.8 million. The decrease was partly offset by intangible assets obtained in the March 2012 acquisition of Avila, which
increased amortization expense by $39.4 million. In addition, the June 2011 FDA approval of ISTODAX  for treatment of PTCL in patients who have received at least one prior therapy
and the October 2012 approval of ABRAXANE  in the U.S. for the treatment of NSCLC resulted in the commencement of amortization of the related intangible assets. The approval of
ABRAXANE  increased amortization expense by $16.3 million and is expected to result in annual amortization expense of approximately $78.0 million over the 15 year
estimated useful life of the associated intangible asset.   

  64  

Table of Contents   

  Amortization
of acquired intangible assets increased by $86.0 million to $289.2 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to a full year's
amortization of intangible assets obtained in the October 2010 acquisition of Abraxis being included in 2011. In addition, in June 2011, the FDA approved ISTODAX , which was obtained in
the January 2010 acquisition of Gloucester, for treatment of PTCL in patients who have received at least one prior therapy. As a result of the FDA approval, amortization of the intangible asset
commenced with an 8.8 year expected useful life, increasing amortization expense by $17.8 million.   

Acquisition Related (Gains) Charges and Restructuring, net:       Acquisition related (gains) charges and restructuring, net was a net charge of $169.0 million in
2012 and a net gain of $142.3 million in 2011. The net increase of $311.3 million in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to a $368.3 million change in the income statement
impact related to our publicly traded contingent value rights, or CVRs. We recorded a $216.8 million charge in 2012 and a $151.5 million favorable adjustment in 2011. In addition, we
recorded a $9.2 million accretion of the contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of Avila. The increases were partly offset by a $63.6 million reduction in the
contingent consideration liability related to the approval of ISTODAX  for PTCL in Europe.   

  Acquisition
related (gains) charges and restructuring, net was a net gain of $142.3 million in 2011, primarily due to a $151.5 million favorable adjustment to the fair value of our
liability
related to our publicly traded CVRs. The favorable adjustment was partly offset by $4.0 million in accretion of contingent consideration related to U.S. and EU approval of ISTODAX 
for treatment of PTCL and $5.2 million in restructuring and other acquisition related charges.   

Interest and Investment Income, Net:       Interest and investment income, net is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollar
amounts in thousands):   

Interest and Investment Income, Net:       Interest and investment income, net decreased by $10.6 million to $15.3 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The
decrease was primarily due to a $3.7 million reduction in interest income due to lower overall interest rates, a $5.1 million net decrease in gains on sales of marketable securities and
a $1.9 million net increase in the cost of amortization of discounts and premiums related to marketable securities.   

Interest
and investment income, net decreased by $18.9 million to $25.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a $14.2 million reduction in interest
income due to lower overall yields, a $7.4 million net reduction in gains on sales of marketable securities and a $0.3 million decrease in dividend income, partly offset by a
$3.0 million net decrease in the amortization of premiums and discounts related to the purchase of marketable securities.

    Interest (Expense):       Interest (expense) is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):   

Interest
(expense) increased by $20.5 million to $63.2 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to interest and fees associated with the issuance of an additional
$1.500 billion in senior notes in August 2012 and an increase in interest on Commercial Paper borrowings, which was in effect for full year 2012.   

  Interest
expense increased by $30.1 million to $42.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $29.6 million increase in interest accrued on the
$1.250 billion in senior notes issued in October 2010 and to the issuance of commercial paper beginning in September 2011.   

    Other Income (Expense), Net:       Other income, net is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):   

Other
income (expense), net was a net expense of $17.0 million in 2012 and primarily included $25.5 million in impairment losses related to cost method investments and net foreign
exchange losses/forward point amortization of $8.4 million, partly offset by a $7.4 million gain on the sale of equity securities, net gains of $3.7 million related to the short
period in June 2012 when certain treasury rate lock agreements were not designated as hedges and a $3.7 million economic development grant from the State of New Jersey. Included in 2011 were
net foreign exchange losses/forward point amortization of $10.9 million and equity method investment losses of $2.8 million, partly offset by a $2.9 million gain on the sale of
non-core assets and $3.6 million in economic development grant proceeds received from the State of New Jersey.   

    Income Tax Provision:       The income tax provision increased by $123.2 million to $225.3 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The full year 2012 underlying
effective tax rate of 13.5% reflects the impact of our global business footprint. The increase in the underlying effective tax rate from 2011 reflects a decrease in tax benefits from certain
acquisition-related items. The effective tax rate for 2012 was reduced by 0.1 percentage points as a result of discrete items, including tax benefits related to the settlement of tax
examinations and expirations of statutes of limitations offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities recorded on certain unremitted foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested
in such foreign jurisdictions and tax expense related to the filing of our 2011 income tax returns with certain items being less favorable than originally estimated. The U.S. research and development
tax credit expired on December 31, 2011 and was retroactively reinstated in the first quarter of 2013. The tax benefit of our 2012 research credit will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
This change in tax law does not have a significant impact on our income tax provisions.   

  66  

Table of Contents    

  The income tax provision decreased by $30.4 million to $102.1 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The full year 2011 underlying effective tax rate of 11.5% reflects
the impact of our global business footprint, the favorable impact of a shift in earnings between the United States and lower tax foreign jurisdictions, and tax deductions related to our acquisitions.
The decrease in the underlying effective tax rate also reflects benefits from an increase in acquisition-related charges, including an IPR D asset impairment charge of $118.0 million and a
non-taxable gain from a decrease in the fair value of our liability under the CVR Agreement related to the acquisition of Abraxis of $151.5 million. The effective tax rate was
reduced by 4.3 percentage points in 2011 as a result of discrete items which included tax benefits related to a foreign tax credit, a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for certain ongoing
income tax audits and expirations of statutes of limitations, and a net tax benefit related to changes in state tax laws.   

  The
income tax provision for 2010 included a full year underlying effective tax rate of 15.9%. The effective tax rate was reduced by 2.8 percentage points in 2010 as a result of discrete items
which included tax benefits related to a settlement of a tax examination and a reduction in a valuation allowance related to certain tax carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in unrecognized
tax benefits for certain ongoing income tax audits.   

    Net Income:       Net income and per common share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands,
except per share data):   

The
$138.0 million increase in net income and $0.45 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2012 compared to 2011 reflected a higher level of net product sales, reduction in amortization of
acquired intangible assets primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully
amortized at the end of 2011 and a decrease in cost of goods sold, resulting from the 2011 inclusion of inventory step-up amortization for sales of ABRAXANE . These favorable
items were partly offset by an increase in the fair value of our liability related to publicly traded CVRs, an increase in payments related to research and development collaboration arrangements and
increase in marketing activity, primarily related to prelaunch expenses for POMALYST  and ABRAXANE  for new indications. Earnings per diluted share were also favorably impacted
in 2012 by the repurchase of 28.6 million common shares under our common share repurchase program, reducing our outstanding share base.   

  Net
income for 2011 reflects the earnings impact from higher sales of REVLIMID , VIDAZA  and a full year's sales of ABRAXANE . The favorable impact of higher
revenues was partly offset by increased spending for new product launches, research and development activities, expansion of our international operations, increase in amortization of intangible assets
related to   

  67  

Table of Contents   

  acquisitions
and an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of senior notes in October 2010. Earnings per diluted share were also favorably impacted in 2011 by the repurchase of
38.3 million common shares under our common share repurchase program, reducing our outstanding share base.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources     

  The following table summarizes the components of our financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):   

(1)    Includes
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale, accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory and other current assets,
less short-term borrowings, accounts payable, accrued expenses, income taxes payable and other current liabilities.    

We rely primarily on positive cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from sales of available-for-sale marketable securities, and
borrowings in the form of long-term notes payable and short-term Commercial Paper to provide for our liquidity requirements. We expect continued growth in our expenditures,
particularly those related to research and development, clinical trials, commercialization of new products, international expansion and capital investments. However, we anticipate that existing cash
and cash equivalent balances, marketable securities available
for sale, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to fund our operating needs, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and our plans to
repurchase stock or pursue other strategic business initiatives for the foreseeable future.   

  Many
of our operations are conducted outside the United States, and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. As of
December 31, 2012, we held approximately $2.700 billion of these short-term funds in foreign tax jurisdictions. The amount of funds held in U.S. tax jurisdictions can
fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as repurchases of our   

  68  

Table of Contents   

  common
stock and business-development activities. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows).
Repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional U.S. federal, state and local income tax payments. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts
earned overseas are expected to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S., no accrual for U.S. taxes is provided. During 2012, we concluded that approximately $900.0 million of our foreign
earnings may not be required for use in offshore operations and may be available for use in the United States. These earnings are no longer treated as permanently reinvested, and accordingly, we
recorded a deferred tax liability of $316.5 million for the estimated U.S. federal and state income taxes that may be incurred should these earnings be repatriated. The remaining foreign
earnings are unremitted and expected to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. We do not rely on these unremitted earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have
sufficient current cash resources combined with future cash flows in the United States to fund our U.S. operational and strategic needs.   

    Share Repurchase Program:       Our Board of Directors has approved an aggregate $6.500 billion stock repurchase program of which we have approximately
$1.837 billion remaining for future share repurchases. During 2012, we used $2.044 billion for repurchases of our common stock, measured on a settlement date basis.   

Components of Working Capital    

    Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available for Sale:       We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, non-U.S. government agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt
securities. All liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than three months
from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities available for sale. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt and equity securities at the
time of purchase. The $1.252 billion increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale at December 31, 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the
issuance of $1.500 billion in senior notes in August 2012 and by cash generated from operations, partly offset by $2.044 billion paid under our share repurchase program,
$352.2 million paid for the acquisition of Avila, and a net repayment of $217.4 million in short-term borrowings.   

  Marketable
securities available for sale are carried at fair value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses
on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges, is included in
interest and investment income, net. For more information related to the fair value and valuation of our marketable securities, see Note 4 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this report.   

    Accounts Receivable, Net:       Accounts receivable, net increased by $15.0 million to $960.5 million at the end of 2012 compared to 2011. The impact of
increased U.S. and international sales of   

  69  

Table of Contents   

  REVLIMID ,
VIDAZA  and ABRAXANE  was partly offset by increased collections in certain markets. Sales made outside the United States typically have payment terms
that are greater than 60 days, thereby extending collection periods beyond those in the United States. We expect our accounts receivable balance to continue to grow as our international sales
continue to expand.   

  We
continue to monitor economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies, the sovereign debt crisis in certain European countries and associated impacts on the
financial markets and our business. Our current business model in these markets is typically to sell our products directly to principally government owned or controlled hospitals, which in turn
directly deliver critical care to patients. Our products are used to treat life-threatening diseases and we believe this business model enables timely delivery and adequate supply of
products. Many of the outstanding receivable balances are related to government-funded hospitals and we believe the receivable balances are ultimately collectible. Similarly, we believe that future
sales to these customers will continue to be collectible.   

  The
credit and economic conditions within Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece, as well as increasing sales levels in those countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the
average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable. Our total net receivables in Spain, Italy and Portugal are composed almost entirely of amounts receivable from government-owned or
controlled hospitals and the public sector and amounted to $324.2 million in 2012 compared to $396.1 million in 2011. Approximately $51.9 million of the $324.2 million
receivable in 2012 was greater than one year past due. Our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in Greece is limited, as we do not have a material amount of receivables in Greece. We maintain timely
and direct communication with hospital customers in Spain, Italy and Portugal regarding both the current and past due receivable balances. We continue to receive payments from these countries, and
closely monitor the plans for payment at the regional government level. Payments from customers in these countries are not received on regular intervals and several months could elapse between
significant payments. This payment pattern was observed in Spain earlier in 2012, where a significant portion of aged receivables were paid in late June and early July 2012. We also regularly request
and receive positive confirmation of the validity of our receivables from most of the regional governmental authorities. We have the option to pursue legal action against certain of our customers. In
view of the protracted timeline associated with collecting the outstanding balances through legal action and the current direct communication with our customers, in many instances, we do not believe
pursuing legal action to be the best approach for any of the parties involved.   

  In
determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts for Spain, Italy, and Portugal, we considered that the balance of past due receivables is related to sales made to government-owned or
supported customers. We regularly monitor developments in Europe to assess whether the level of risk of default for any customers has increased and note the ongoing efforts by the European Union,
European Monetary Union and International Monetary Fund to support countries with large public deficits and outstanding debt balances. We also monitor the efforts of individual countries to support
their regions with large public deficits and outstanding debt balances. We have not experienced significant losses or write-offs with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable
in these countries as a result of their economic difficulties and we do not expect to have write-offs or adjustments to accounts receivable which would have a material adverse impact on
our financial position or results of operations.

Table of Contents    

    Inventory:       Inventory balances increased by $69.9 million to $259.5 million at the end of 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to
increases in REVLIMID , VIDAZA  and ABRAXANE  inventories, attributable to higher anticipated sales levels.   

Other Current Assets:       Other current assets decreased by $74.9 million to $320.2 million at the end of 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a
$64.1 million decrease in prepaid taxes and a
$60.0 million decrease in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts, partly offset by an increase in other prepaid accounts.   

    Commercial Paper:       In September 2011, we entered into a commercial paper program, or the Program, under which we issue unsecured commercial paper notes, or
Commercial Paper, on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.000 billion, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes. The
maturities of the Commercial Paper may vary, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper is sold under customary terms to a dealer or in the commercial paper market
and is issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, is sold at par and bears varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Borrowings under the Program are accounted for as
short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2012, $308.5 million of Commercial Paper was outstanding bearing an effective interest rate of 0.5%.   

    Senior Unsecured Credit Facility:       In September 2011, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, providing for revolving
credit in the aggregate amount of $1.000 billion. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the amount of the Credit Facility (but in no event more than one time per annum),
up to a maximum aggregate amount of $1.250 billion.   

  The
Credit Facility has a five-year term and amounts may be borrowed for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. The Credit Facility serves as backup liquidity
for our Commercial Paper borrowings. As of December 31, 2012 there was no outstanding borrowing against the Credit Facility.   

  The
Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including certain customary financial covenants. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2012.   

Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities:       Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by
$391.0 million to $1.353 billion at the end of 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $277.4 million reclassification of the liability associated with our
publicly traded CVRs from non-current to current, a $51.5 million increase in clinical trial accruals, a $17.4 million increase in the contingent consideration related to the
January 2012 Avila acquisition and a $16.6 million increase in accrued interest.   

    Income Taxes Payable (Current and Non-Current):       Income taxes payable decreased by $446.5 million to $200.0 million at the end of 2012
compared to 2011, primarily from tax payments of $469.6 million, the application of previously refundable prepaid income taxes of $11.4 million, a tax benefit of stock options of
$43.4 million, net deferred intercompany credits of $50.3 million offset by the current provision for income taxes of $125.1 million, which includes a benefit related to tax
settlements of $373.0 million.

Table of Contents   

    Senior Notes:       In August 2012, we issued an additional $1.500 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 1.90% Senior Notes due 2017, or the 2017 notes, and $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes" and, together with the 2017
notes, referred to herein as the "2012 issued notes"). The 2012 issued notes were issued at 99.786% and 99.949% of par, respectively, and the discount is being amortized as additional interest expense
over the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of approximately $11.7 million have been recorded as debt issuance costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being
amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the period from issuance through maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears
on February 15 and August 15 each year beginning February 15, 2013 and the principal on each note is due in full at their respective maturity dates. The notes may be redeemed at
our option, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price defined in a make-whole clause equaling accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of the principal amount of
the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis plus 20
basis points in the case of the 2017 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2022 notes. If we experience a change of control accompanied by a downgrade of the debt to below investment grade, we
will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We are subject to covenants which limit our ability to
pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving our property. The carrying value of the senior notes was
$2.771 billion at December 31, 2012.   

Cash
flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in thousands):   

Operating Activities:       Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $242.4 million to $2.019 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase
in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an expansion of our operations and related increase in net earnings.   

  Net
cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased by $594.6 million to $1.776 billion as compared to 2010. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was
primarily attributable to an expansion of our operations and related increase in net earnings, partially   

  72  

Table of Contents   

  offset
by the increase in accounts receivable associated with expanding international sales, which take longer to collect, and the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.   

Investing Activities:       Net cash used in investing activities in 2012 changed to a net usage of $1.554 billion compared to $377.7 million of net cash
provided by investing activities in 2011. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was principally related to a cash use of $1.025 billion for net purchases of marketable
securities available for sale during 2012 compared to net sales of $481.8 million in 2011, plus usages of $352.2 million for the acquisition of Avila and $48.9 million for the
purchase of intellectual property and other assets.   

Net
cash provided by investing activities in 2011 changed to a positive $377.7 million compared to a net cash use of $2.107 billion in 2010. The 2010 investing activities included net
cash used in the acquisition of Abraxis of $2.315 billion and the acquisition of Gloucester of $337.6 million.   

    Financing Activities:       Net cash used in financing activities in 2012 was $248.7 million compared to a net cash use of $1.622 billion in 2011. The
$1.373 billion decrease in net cash used in
financing activities in 2012 was primarily attributable to $1.487 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by $217.4 million of net
repayments of short-term borrowing in 2012 compared to $525.7 million of net short-term borrowing in 2011. During 2012 and 2011, we used $2.044 billion and
$2.189 billion, respectively, for repurchases of our common stock, measured on a settlement date basis.   

  Net
cash used in financing activities in 2011 was $1.622 billion compared to net cash provided of $1.177 billion in 2010. The $2.799 billion decrease in net cash provided by
financing activities in 2011 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2010 that provided net cash of $1.237 billion and the
$2.189 billion in common share repurchases in 2011 under the common share repurchase program.   

    Contractual Obligations     

  The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands):   

(1)    The
senior note obligation amounts include future principal and interest payments.    

Senior Notes:       In August 2012, we issued $1.500 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of
1.90% Senior Notes due 2017, and   

  73  

Table of Contents   

  $1.000 billion
aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2022. The 2012 issued notes were issued at 99.786% and 99.949% of par, respectively, and the discount is being amortized as
additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of approximately $11.7 million have been recorded as debt issuance costs on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and are being amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the period from issuance through maturity. Interest on the notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year beginning February 15, 2013 and the principal on each note is due in full at their respective maturity
dates. The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price defined in a make-whole clause equaling accrued and unpaid interest
plus the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal discounted to the date of
redemption on a semi-annual basis plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2017 notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2022 notes. If we experience a change of control accompanied by
a downgrade of the debt to below investment grade, we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We
are subject to covenants which limit our ability to pledge
properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving our property.   

  In
October 2010, we issued a total of $1.250 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015,
$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2020 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.7% Senior Notes due 2040.   

    Short-term Borrowings:       Contractual obligations related to short-term borrowings included principal, interest and fees of
$308.5 million related to commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2012.   

    Operating Leases:       We lease office and research facilities under various operating lease agreements in the United States and various international markets. The
non-cancelable lease terms for operating leases expire at various dates between 2013 and 2023 and include renewal options. In general, we are also required to reimburse the lessors for
real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases. For more information on the major facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements refer to
Part I, Item 2, "Properties" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

    Other Contract Commitments:       Other contract commitments of $89.4 million on December 31, 2012 include $64.1 million in contractual obligations
related to product supply contracts. In addition, we have committed to invest an aggregate $25.0 million in two investment funds over a ten-year period, which is callable at any
time. On December 31, 2012, our remaining investment commitment was $5.4 million.   

    Collaboration Arrangements:       We have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain
development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory
and/or commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon
continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the   

  74  

Table of Contents   

  programs.
Due to the nature of these arrangements, the future potential payments related to the attainment of specified development and regulatory approval milestones over a period of several years
are inherently uncertain, and accordingly, no amounts have been recorded for these future potential payments in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 contained in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Potential milestone payments total approximately $6.202 billion, including approximately $4.284 billion contingent on the achievement of
various research, development and regulatory approval milestones and approximately $1.918 billion in sales-based milestones. The most significant collaboration agreements are identified in
Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

    New Accounting Principles     

In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2012-02,
"Intangibles   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment," or ASU 2012-02. ASU 2012-02 allows a company the
option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under that option, a company would no longer be required to calculate the
fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the company determines, based on that qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived
intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for periods beginning after
September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted and we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2012. The adoption of ASU 2012-02 did not have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.   

    Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies     

  A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires
management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant
accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting estimates and
policies to be critical:   

    Revenue Recognition:       Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for
discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. We record
estimated reductions to revenue for volume-based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such volume-based discounts and rebates are based on the
sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis.   

  We
recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees' sales of our products or products using our technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when
royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. If royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably
assured, royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received.   

  75  

Table of Contents   

    Gross to Net Sales Accruals:       We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, and chargebacks and
distributor service fees.   

  We
base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history
and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as
applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination
is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer
eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical
return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. REVLIMID  is distributed primarily through hospitals and
contracted pharmacies, lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity. THALOMID  is
drop-shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a result, wholesalers do not stock the product.   

  Sales
discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.   

  Government
rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are
generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare
Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations
is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We have also analyzed actual billings received from certain states to further support the
accrual rates. Subsequent to implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the 2010 U.S. Health Care
Reform Law, certain states have not yet submitted actual Medicaid Managed Care Organization bills, resulting in an increase in the accrual balance. Effective January 1, 2011, manufacturers of
pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this
coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical
invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as incurred. In addition, certain international markets have government-sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program
specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.   

  Rebates
or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices.
Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical
redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler   

  76  

Table of Contents   

  inventories,
contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.   

  Chargeback
accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally
qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S.
Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated
Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.   

    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:       We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit worthiness of our customers, historical payment
patterns, aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions, including publicly available information on the credit worthiness of countries themselves and provinces or areas within such
countries where they are the ultimate customers.   

    Income Taxes:       We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected
to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.   

  We
account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among
multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject
experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax
benefits. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted.   

  We
periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a
portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing
jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is
required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. At December 31, 2012, it
was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.   

    Share-Based Compensation:       The cost of share-based compensation is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the fair value of all awards
granted, using the Black-Scholes method of valuation for stock options. The fair values of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units are based on the market value of our Common
Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is   

  77  

Table of Contents   

  recognized
over the service period required to obtain full vesting. Compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an
estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience.   

    Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of
Available-For-Sale Marketable Securities:       A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale marketable
security below its cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to operations and a new
cost basis for the security established. The determination of whether an available-for-sale marketable security is other-than-temporarily impaired
requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment. Factors evaluated to determine whether the
investment is other-than-temporarily impaired include: significant deterioration in the issuer's earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the
issuer, adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates, length of time that the fair value has been below our cost, our expected future cash flows from the security, our
intent not to sell, an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis, and issues that raise concerns about the issuer's ability to
continue as a going concern. Assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions, which could differ from our assessment.   

    Derivatives and Hedging Activities:       All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and, if it
is, the type of hedging transaction. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging
instruments and hedged item. We assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective
in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. We assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if
any, to current earnings. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recognized in current earnings. We use derivative instruments, including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange
and interest rates. The use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative
trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives.   

    Investments in Other Entities:       We hold a portfolio of investments in equity securities and certain investment funds that are accounted for under either the equity
method or cost method. Investments in companies or certain investment funds over which we have significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method, with our
share of earnings or losses reported in other income (expense), net. Our cost method and equity method investments are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  All
of our investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment. If an investment's fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be
other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is   

  78  

Table of Contents   

  judgmental
and dependent on specific facts and circumstances. Factors considered in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: market
value or exit price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the investee; length of time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial
condition and business prospects of the investee; our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues that
raise concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern; and any other information that we may be aware of related to the investment.   

Accounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans:       We have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed to provide key officers and
executives with performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a three-year period. We
currently have three separate three-year performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Performance measures for the performance cycle ending in
2013 are based on the following components in the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP earnings per share; 25% on non-GAAP net income; and 50% on
total non-GAAP revenue, as defined. The performance cycles ending in 2014 and 2015 are based on the following components: 37.5% on non-GAAP earnings per share; 37.5% on total
non-GAAP revenue, as defined; and 25% on relative total shareholder return, which is a measurement of our stock price performance during the year compared with a group of other companies
in the biopharmaceutical industry.   

  Payouts
may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participant's salary for the LTIPs. Such awards are payable in cash or common stock or a mixture of cash and common stock, which will be determined by
the Compensation Committee at the time of award delivery. For awards payable in common stock, the number of shares is determined using the average closing price for the 30 trading days prior to the
beginning of the cycle. Payments made in common stock are restricted from trading for a period of three years. We accrue the long-term incentive liability over each three-year
cycle. Prior to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to
an immediate payment equal to their target award or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control.   

  Accruals
recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions concerning future non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP revenues, as
defined; the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used. Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability
recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts. In estimating the accruals, management considers actual results to date for the performance period, expected results for the remainder of the
performance period, operating trends, product development, pricing and competition.   

    Valuation of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and IPR D:       We have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and IPR D primarily through the acquisitions of
Pharmion, Gloucester, Abraxis and Avila. When identifiable intangible assets, including in-process research and development, are acquired, we determine the fair values of these assets as
of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices   

  79  

Table of Contents   

  are
not available, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:  

projecting regulatory approvals,   
           estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects
and  
           developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates    

Goodwill
represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized, but
subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. We test our goodwill annually for impairment each November 30. We
are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value, as determined by our traded share price, as compared to our book value of
net assets.   

  Intangible
assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur. Intangible assets
related to IPR D product rights are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets. At that time,
we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of IPR D and begin amortization. Impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that
could indicate a potential impairment. Such test entails completing an updated discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the asset. Our existing IPR D product rights were obtained in
the acquisitions of Gloucester and Avila. The Gloucester related product rights will become definite-lived intangibles when marketing approval is received for ISTODAX  for treatment of
PTCL in the European Union. The Avila related product rights will become definite-lived intangibles when marketing approval is received for CC-292 for any indication in any major market.   

    Valuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination:       We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair
value on the acquisition date, and for each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings in the
consolidated statements of income. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of CVRs, adjustments to discount rates and
periods, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with
regulatory approval. The assumptions related to determining the value of a contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a material
impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period. Our contingent consideration liabilities were acquired in the acquisitions of Gloucester, Abraxis, and Avila. The
fair values of the Gloucester and Avila contingent consideration liabilities are based on the discount rate, probability and estimated timing of cash milestone payments to the former shareholders or
each company. The fair value of the Abraxis   

  80  

Table of Contents   

  contingent
consideration liability is based on the quoted market price of the publicly traded CVRs.    

ITEM 7A.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK             

  The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk
represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or
future earnings.   

  We
have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending
on market conditions. Although investments may be subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any
single issue, issuer or type of investment. At December 31, 2012, our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale, our long-term debt and
certain foreign exchange contracts.   

    Marketable Securities Available for Sale:       At December 31, 2012, our marketable securities available for sale consisted of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, non-U.S. government, agency and Supranational securities, global corporate debt
securities and a marketable equity security. U.S. government-sponsored agency securities include general unsecured obligations either issued directly by or guaranteed by U.S. Government Sponsored
Enterprises. U.S. government-sponsored agency MBS include mortgage backed securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Government
National Mortgage Association. Non-U.S. government, agency and Supranational securities consist of direct obligations of highly rated governments of nations other than the United States,
obligations of sponsored agencies and other entities that are guaranteed or supported by highly rated governments of nations other than the United States. Corporate debt   global
includes obligations issued by investment-grade corporations including some issues that have been guaranteed by governments and government agencies.   

Marketable
securities available for sale are carried at fair value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses
on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges, is included in
interest and investment income, net.

  As
of December 31, 2012, the principal amounts, fair values and related weighted-average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for
sale were as follows (in thousands):   

Long-Term Debt:       In August 2012, we issued a total of $1.500 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 1.90% Senior Notes due 2017and $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2022. The 2012 issued notes were issued at 99.786% and 99.949%
of par, respectively, and the discount is being amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of approximately $11.7 million have been
recorded as debt issuance costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the period from issuance through
maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year beginning February 15, 2013 and the principal on each note
is due in full at their respective maturity dates. The notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price defined in a
make-whole clause equaling accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of interest and principal discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2017 notes and 25 basis points in the case
of the 2022 notes. If a change of control occurs accompanied by a downgrade of the debt to below investment grade, we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We are subject to covenants which limit our ability to pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit our ability
to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving our property.   

  On
October 7, 2010, we issued a total of $1.250 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2015,
$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2020 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.7% Senior Notes due 2040. The notes were issued at 99.854%,
99.745% and 99.813% of par, respectively, and the discount amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity. Offering costs of approximately $10.5 million
have been recorded as debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the period from issuance
through maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year and the principal on each note is due in full at their
respective maturity dates. The notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equaling accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of the
principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal. If we experience a change of control accompanied by a
downgrade of the debt to below investment grade, we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid

  interest.
We are subject to covenants which limit our ability to pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving
our property.   

  At
December 31, 2012, the fair value of our senior notes outstanding was $2.893 billion.   

    MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT     

  Our revenue and earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest
rates. We manage the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such
as foreign currency options, foreign currency forward contracts, treasury rate lock agreements and interest rate swap contracts.   

Foreign Currency Risk Management      

  We have established revenue hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to mitigate volatility in future foreign currency cash flows and
changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign exchange rates.   

  Through
our revenue hedging program, we endeavor to reduce the impact of possible unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates on our future U.S. dollar cash flows that are derived from foreign
currency denominated sales. To achieve this objective, we hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated sales that are expected to occur in the foreseeable future, typically no more
than three years into the future. We manage our anticipated transaction exposure principally with foreign currency forward contracts and occasionally foreign currency put and call options.   

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:       We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to
reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.   

  We
enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily associated
with non-functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011 had
settlement dates within 36 months. These foreign currency
forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, and reclassified to
operations in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect operations. Any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other income   

  83  

Table of Contents   

  (expense),
net. Foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at December 31, 2012 and 2011:   

We
consider the impact of our own and the counterparties' credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract on an
ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2012, credit risk did not materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts.   

  We
also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
These foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges and, accordingly, any changes in their fair value are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income in other income
(expense), net in the current period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency forward non-designated hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were
$795.4 million and $916.9 million, respectively.   

  Although
not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 10% threshold reflects a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currency rates. Assuming that the December 31,
2012 exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately $227.9 million. However, since the contracts
either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies or relate to assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities' functional
currencies, any change in the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged
transactions affect earnings or re-measured through earnings each period along with the underlying asset or liability   

    Foreign Currency Option Contracts:       During 2012, we began hedging a portion of our future foreign currency exposure by utilizing a strategy that involves both a
purchased local currency put option and a written local currency call option that are accounted for as hedges of future sales denominated in Euros. Specifically, we sell (or write) a local currency
call option and purchase a local currency put option with the same expiration dates and amounts but with different strike prices; this combination of transactions is generally referred to as a
"collar". The expiration dates and notional amounts correspond to the amount and timing of forecasted future foreign currency sales. If the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the currency of the hedged
anticipated sales, the purchased put option value reduces to zero and we benefit from the increase in the U.S. dollar   

  84

  equivalent
value of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows, however this benefit would be capped at the strike level of the written call, which forms the upper end of the collar. The premium
collected from the call option partially offsets the premium paid for the purchased put option, resulting in a net cost for the collars.   

  In
order to fully offset the net cost of the collars, we also sold local currency put options with a lower strike price and the same expiration dates and amounts as the option contracts that were used
to hedge sales. These written put options introduced risk of loss if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen beyond the strike price of the written put options. In December 2012, we entered into purchased
put options that are not designated as hedges in order to partially offset the risk of loss that would be incurred on the written put options if the US dollar were to strengthen beyond the strike
price of the written put. Gains and losses associated with the non-hedge put options have been recorded on the income statement as other income (expense), net.   

  Foreign
currency option contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at December 31, 2012:   

*    U.S.
Dollar notional amounts are calculated as the hedged local currency amount multiplied times the strike value of the foreign currency option. The local
currency notional amounts of our purchased put, and written call that are designated as hedging activity are equal to each other.    

Although
not predictive in nature, we believe a hypothetical 10% threshold reflects a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currency rates. Assuming that the December 31,
2012 exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical 10%, the fair value of the foreign currency option contracts that are designated as hedges would change by approximately $24.1 million.
However, since the foreign currency option contracts designated as hedges hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies, any change in the fair value of the
contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings or
re-measured through earnings each period along with the underlying asset or liability. Assuming that the December 31, 2012 exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical 10%, the
fair value of the foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedges would decrease by approximately $0.9 million if the U.S. Dollar were to strengthen, and would increase by
approximately $2.2 million if the U.S. Dollar were to weaken. This impact would be recorded to income during the period during which the change in currency rates occurred.

     Interest Rate Risk Management      

    Treasury Rate Lock Agreements:       During 2012, we entered into treasury rate lock agreements, or treasury rate locks, in anticipation of issuing
fixed-rate notes that were issued in August 2012. With the exception of a short period in June when certain outstanding treasury rate locks were not designated as hedges, our treasury rate
locks are designated as cash flow hedges and, to the extent effective, any realized or unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in OCI and will be recognized in income over the life of the
anticipated fixed-rate notes. Treasury rate locks were settled during 2012 which resulted in losses of $35.3 million that were recorded to OCI. During the short period in June when
we had outstanding treasury rate locks that were not considered hedging instruments, we recorded the change in fair value of $3.7 million in other income (expense), net. No material amounts
were recorded in income during 2012 or 2011 as a result of hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. At December 31, 2012 we had no outstanding
treasury rate locks.   

    Interest Rate Swap Contracts:       From time to time we hedge the fair value of certain debt obligations through the use of interest rate swap contracts. The interest
rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in interest rates. Since the specific terms and notional amount of the swap are intended to
match those of the debt being hedged, it is assumed to be a highly effective hedge and all changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact
recorded in income. Any net interest payments made or received on interest rate swap contracts are recognized as interest expense.   

  In
2011, we settled outstanding interest rate swap contracts we entered into with respect to our $500.0 million 2.45% fixed notes due in 2015 resulting in the receipt of $34.3 million.
The proceeds from the settlements are being accounted for as a reduction of current and future
interest expense associated with these notes. During 2012, we terminated the hedging relationship on $800.0 million notional amount of swap contracts that had been entered into earlier in 2012
as hedges of our 1.9% fixed rate notes due in 2017 and our 3.25% fixed rate notes due in 2022 by settling certain of the contracts and entering into offsetting contracts for those not settled. This
resulted in gains of $5.0 million that are being accounted for as a reduction of current and future interest expense associated with these notes.   

  At
December 31, 2012, we were a party to pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the
notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes. Our swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012 consisted of $100.0 million aggregate notional amount
maturing in 2017, which effectively convert a portion of our $500.0 million, 1.90% fixed-rate notes due in 2017 to a floating rate and $200.0 million aggregate notional
amount maturing in 2022, which effectively converts a portion of our $1.000 billion, 3.25% fixed-rate notes due in 2022 to a floating rate.   

  In
January 2013 we entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of $400.0 million related to our 1.90% fixed-rate notes due in 2017 and
$800.0 million related to our 3.25% fixed-rate notes due in 2022.   

  A
sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of our debt and interest rate swap contracts from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in
interest rates at December 31, 2012 would have reduced the aggregate fair value of our net payable by $169.3 million. A one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2012 would
have increased the aggregate fair value of our net payable by $188.7 million.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     

  The Board of Directors and Stockholders   

  Celgene
Corporation:   

  We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the consolidated financial statement schedule, "Schedule II   Valuation and Qualifying Accounts." These consolidated
financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.   

  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

  In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.   

  We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 15, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Thousands of dollars, except per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)     

1.     Nature of Business and Basis and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     

  Celgene Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively "we," "our," "us," "Celgene" or the "Company") is a global biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the
discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. We are dedicated to innovative research and development which is
designed to bring new therapies to market and are involved in research in several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, targeting areas such as
intracellular signaling pathways in cancer and immune cells, immunomodulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases, and therapeutic application of cell therapies.   

Our
primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID , VIDAZA , ABRAXANE , THALOMID  (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene ), and
ISTODAX . POMALYST  was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2013 for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior
therapies, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. Additional sources of
revenue include royalties from Novartis on their sales of FOCALIN XR  and the entire RITALIN  family of drugs, other licensing royalties, and the sale of services through our
Celgene Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary.   

  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celgene Corporation and its subsidiaries. Investments in limited partnerships and interests where we have an equity interest of 50% or
less and do not otherwise have a controlling financial interest are accounted for by either the equity or cost method. We record net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest,
if any, in our Consolidated Statements of Income equal to the percentage of ownership interest retained in the respective operations by the non-controlling parties. Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.   

  The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. We are subject to certain risks and uncertainties related to product development, regulatory approval, market acceptance, scope of patent and proprietary rights, competition, outcome of
civil and governmental proceedings, European credit risk, technological change and product liability.   

    Financial Instruments:       Certain financial instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (e.g., cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
certain other assets, accounts payable, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities) are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.
The fair values of financial instruments other than marketable securities are determined through a combination of management estimates and information obtained from third parties using the latest
market data. The fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities is determined utilizing the valuation techniques appropriate to the type of security (See
Note 4).

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)     

    Derivative Instruments and Hedges:       All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and, if it
is, the type of hedging transaction. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging
instruments and hedged item. We assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective
in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. We assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments,
if any, to current earnings. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recognized in current earnings. We use derivative instruments, including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange
and interest rates. The use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative
trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives.   

    Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available for Sale:       We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency
securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, non-U.S. government, agency and Supranational securities and global corporate debt securities. All liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than three months from date of purchase
are classified as marketable securities available for sale. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt and equity securities at the time of purchase. Marketable
securities available for sale are carried at fair value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment
charges, is included in interest and investment income, net.   

  A
decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below its carrying value that is determined to be other-than-temporary would result in
a charge to earnings and decrease in the security's carrying value down to its newly established fair value. Factors evaluated to determine if an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the issuer; adverse changes in
the general market condition in which the issuer operates; our intent to hold to maturity and an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of
its cost basis; our expected future cash flows from the security; and issues that raise concerns about the issuer's ability to continue as a going concern.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

    Concentration of Credit Risk:       Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of
credit risk. We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency fixed rate securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency
mortgage-backed fixed rate securities and FDIC guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt, non-U.S. government issued securities and non-U.S. government guaranteed securities (See
Note 6). We may also invest in unrated or below investment grade securities, such as equity in private companies. We have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to
maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.   

  We
sell our products in the United States primarily through wholesale distributors and specialty contracted pharmacies. Therefore, wholesale distributors and large pharmacy chains account for a large
portion of our U.S. trade receivables and net product revenues (See Note 19). International sales are primarily made directly to hospitals, clinics and retail chains, many of which in Europe
are government owned and have extended their payment terms in recent years given the economic pressure these countries are facing. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of our customers,
including these governments, and have internal policies regarding customer credit limits. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit worthiness of our customers,
historical payment patterns, aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions, including publicly available information on the credit worthiness of countries themselves and provinces or
areas within such countries where they are the ultimate customers.   

  We
continue to monitor economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies, the sovereign debt crisis in certain European countries and associated impacts on the
financial markets and our business. Our current business model in these markets is typically to sell our products directly to principally government owned or controlled hospitals, who in turn directly
deliver critical care to patients. Our products are used to treat life-threatening diseases and we believe this business model enables timely delivery and adequate supply of products. Many
of the outstanding receivable balances are related to government-funded hospitals and we believe the receivable balances are ultimately collectible. Similarly, we believe that future sales to these
customers will continue to be collectible.   

  The
credit and economic conditions within Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece, as well as increasing sales levels in those countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the
average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable. Our total net receivables in Spain, Italy and Portugal are composed almost entirely of amounts receivable from government-owned or
controlled hospitals and the public sector and amounted to $324.2 million at December 31, 2012 compared to $396.1 million at December 31, 2011. Approximately
$51.9 million of the $324.2 million receivable at December 31, 2012 was greater than one year past due. Our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in Greece is limited, as we do
not have a material amount of receivables in Greece. We maintain timely and direct communication with hospital customers in Spain, Italy and Portugal regarding both the current and past due   

  97  

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  receivable
balances. We continue to receive payments from these countries, and closely monitor the plans for payment at the regional government level. Payments from customers in these countries are
not received on regular intervals and several months could elapse between significant payments. This payment pattern was observed in Spain, where a significant portion of aged receivables were paid in
late June and early July 2012. We also regularly request and receive positive confirmation of the validity of our receivables from most of the regional governmental authorities. We have the option to
pursue legal action against certain of our customers. In view of the protracted timeline associated with collecting the outstanding balances through legal action and the current direct communication
with our customers, in many instances, we do not believe pursuing legal action to be the best approach for any of the parties involved.   

  In
determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts for Spain, Italy and Portugal, we considered that the balance of past due receivables is related to sales made to government-owned or
supported customers. We regularly monitor developments in Europe to assess whether the level of risk of default for any customers has increased and note the ongoing efforts by the European Union,
European Monetary Union and International Monetary Fund to support countries with large public deficits and outstanding debt balances. We also monitor the efforts of individual countries to support
their regions with large public deficits and outstanding debt balances. We have not experienced significant losses or write-offs with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable
in these countries as a result of their economic difficulties and we do not expect to have write-offs or adjustments to accounts receivable which would have a material adverse impact on
our financial position or results of operations.   

    Inventory:       Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We periodically
review the composition of inventory in order to identify obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise non-saleable items. If non-saleable items are observed and there are no
alternate uses for the inventory, we will record a write-down to net realizable value in the period that the decline in value is first recognized. Included in inventory are raw materials
used in the production of preclinical and clinical products, which are charged to research and development expense when consumed.   

    Assets Held for Sale:       Assets to be disposed of were separately presented in the consolidated
balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and were not depreciated. The assets and related liabilities of a disposal group classified as held
for sale were presented separately in the current asset and current liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet.   

    Property, Plant and Equipment:       Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of plant and equipment is recorded
using the straight-line method. Building improvements are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the building. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the economic
useful life   

  98  

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

of
the asset or the remaining term of the lease, including anticipated renewal options. The estimated useful lives of capitalized assets are as follows:   

Buildings  
     
  40 years  

Building and operating equipment  
     
  15 years  

Manufacturing machinery and equipment  
     
  10 years  

Other machinery and equipment  
     
  5 years  

Furniture and fixtures  
     
  5 years  

Computer equipment and software  
     
  3-7 years  

Maintenance
and repairs are charged to operations as incurred, while expenditures for improvements which extend the life of an asset are capitalized.   

    Capitalized Software Costs:       We capitalize software costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software. Capitalized software costs are included in
property, plant and equipment, net and are amortized over their estimated useful life of three to seven years from the date the systems are ready for their intended use.   

Investments in Other Entities:       We hold a portfolio of investments in equity securities and certain investment funds that are accounted for under either the equity
method or cost method. Investments in companies or certain investment funds over which we have significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method, with our
share of earnings or losses reported in other income (expense), net. Our cost method and equity method investments are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

  All
investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment. If an investment's fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be
other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances. Factors considered
in determining whether an
other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or future rounds of financing by
the investee; length of time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition and business prospects of the investee; our intent and ability to retain the investment for a
sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues that raise concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern; any other information that we
may be aware of related to the investment.   

    Other Intangible Assets:       Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and
reviewed for impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets which are not amortized include acquired
in-process research and development, or IPR D, and acquired intangible assets held for sale. Amortization is initiated for IPR D intangible assets when their useful lives have been
determined. IPR D intangible assets which are determined to have had a drop in their fair value are adjusted downward and an expense recognized on the earnings statement. These are tested at least
annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment.   

  99  

Table of Contents    

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)     

    Goodwill:       Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method
of accounting and is not amortized, but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. We test our goodwill annually for
impairment each November 30.   

    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:       Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and certain other long-term assets
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.   

  Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the assets exceed their estimated future undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount
of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.   

    Contingent Consideration from Business Combinations:       Subsequent to the acquisition date, we measure contingent consideration arrangements at fair value for each
period with changes in fair value recognized in operating earnings. Changes in fair values reflect new information about related IPR D assets and the passage of time. In the absence of new
information, changes in fair value reflect only the passage of time as development work towards the achievement of the milestones progresses, and is accrued based on an accretion schedule.   

Foreign Currency Translation:       Operations in non-U.S. entities are recorded in the functional currency of each entity. For financial reporting purposes,
the functional currency of an entity is determined by a review of the source of an entity's most predominant cash flows. The results of operations for non-U.S. dollar functional currency
entities are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars using the average currency rate during each month, which approximates the results that would be obtained using actual currency
rates on the dates of individual transactions. Assets and liabilities are translated using currency rates at the end of the period. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of
our foreign entities into the U.S. dollar are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are
recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We had net foreign exchange losses of $10.8 million in 2012, $3.1 million in 2011 and
$9.8 million in 2010.   

    Research and Development Costs:       Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These include all internal and external costs related to services
contracted by us. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval.
Milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product.   

Income Taxes:       We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected
to reverse. A valuation

  allowance
is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or
expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained.   

    Revenue Recognition:       Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer. Provisions for
discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.   

  Sales
discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.   

  Government
rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are
generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare
Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations
is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We have also analyzed actual billings received from certain states to further support the
accrual rates. Subsequent to implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the 2010 U.S. Health Care
Reform Law, certain states have not yet submitted actual Medicaid Managed Care Organization bills, resulting in an increase in the accrual balance. Effective January 1, 2011, manufacturers of
pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this
coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical
invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as incurred. In addition, certain international markets have government-sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program
specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.   

  Rebates
or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices.
Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical
redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related
to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.   

  We
base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history
and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as
applicable. If the historical data we used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns,   

  101  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  then
a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual
returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that
is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales
return allowance.   

  Chargeback
accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally
qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S.
Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are based on estimated
Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.   

  We
record estimated reductions to revenue for free goods and volume-based discounts at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such free goods and volume-based discounts
are based on the sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis.
The cost of free goods is included in Cost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets).   

  We
recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees' sales of its products or products using its technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when
royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. If royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably
assured, royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received.   

    Share-Based Compensation:       We utilize share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance-based restricted stock
units, or PSUs. Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the estimated fair value of the awards at grant date. Compensation expense recognized reflects an
estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period required to obtain full vesting. Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU
grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest. If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be
met, any compensation expense recognized to date associated with grants that are not expected to vest will be reversed.   

  The
fair values of stock option grants are estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair values of RSU and PSU grants are based on the market value of our
Common Stock on the date of grant.

    Earnings Per Share:       Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, assuming potentially dilutive common shares, resulting
from option exercises, restricted stock units, warrants and other incentives had been issued and any proceeds thereof used to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The
assumed proceeds used to repurchase common stock is the sum of the amount to be paid to us upon exercise of options, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet
recognized and, if applicable, the amount of excess income tax benefit that would be credited to paid-in capital upon exercise.   

    New Accounting Pronouncements:       In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU,
No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)," or ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 was issued to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of
financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The guidance in ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present components of other
comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity and requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous
statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. We have adopted ASU 2011-05 during the first quarter of 2012 and have presented the components of other
comprehensive income in separate Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.   

  In
July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, "Intangibles   Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment," or ASU
2012-02. ASU 2012-02 allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under that
option, a company would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the company determines, based on that qualitative assessment, that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible
asset impairment tests performed for periods beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted and we have adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2012. The adoption of ASU
2012-02 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.   

   2.     Acquisitions and Divestitures     

    Avila Acquisition     

  On March 7, 2012, or the Acquisition Date, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Avila Therapeutics, Inc., subsequently
renamed Celgene Avilomics Research, herein referred to as Avila. The acquisition resulted in Avila becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. The results of operations for Avila are included in our
consolidated financial statements from the Acquisition Date and the assets and liabilities of Avila have been recorded at their respective fair values on the Acquisition Date and consolidated with our
other assets and liabilities. Avila's results of   

  103  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  operations
prior to the Acquisition Date were determined to be immaterial to us; therefore, pro forma financial statements are not required to be presented.   

  We
paid $352.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and may make additional payments of up to an estimated maximum of $595.0 million in contingent developmental and regulatory
milestone payments.   

  Avila
is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the design and development of targeted covalent drugs to achieve best-in-class outcomes. Avila's product pipeline has
been created using its proprietary Avilomics  platform for developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing. Avila's most advanced product candidate,
CC-292, formerly AVL-292, a potential treatment for cancer and autoimmune diseases, is currently in phase I clinical testing. We acquired Avila to enhance our portfolio
of potential therapies for patients with life-threatening illnesses worldwide.   

  Our
potential contingent consideration payments are classified as liabilities, which were measured at fair value as of the Acquisition Date. The range of potential milestone payments is from no
payment if none of the milestones are achieved to an estimated maximum of $595.0 million if all milestones are achieved. The potential milestones consist of developmental and regulatory
achievements, including milestones for the initiation of phase II and phase III studies, investigational new drug, or IND, filings, and other regulatory events.   

We
estimated the fair value of potential contingent consideration using a probability-weighted income approach, which reflects the probability and timing of future potential payments. This fair value
measurement is based on significant input not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 liability within the fair value hierarchy. The resulting probability-weighted cash flows
were discounted using a discount rate based on a market participant assumption.   

  The
acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the Acquisition
Date and requires the fair value of acquired IPR D to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts.   

  The
fair value of consideration transferred in the acquisition of Avila is shown in the table below:   

104  

Table of Contents    

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)     

The purchase price allocation resulted in the following amounts being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Acquisition Date based upon their respective fair values
summarized below:   

(1)    Includes
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities.      (2)    Platform
technology related to the Avilomics  discovery platform which is being amortized over a useful life of seven years based on the
estimated useful life of the platform.      (3)    Includes
current deferred income tax asset of $14.7 million and non-current deferred tax liability of $179.7 million.    

The
fair values of current assets, current liabilities and property, plant and equipment were determined to approximate their book values.   

  The
fair value of the platform technology intangible asset was based primarily on expected cash flows from future product candidates to be developed from the Avilomics  platform and the
fair value assigned to acquired IPR D was primarily based on expected cash flows from the CC-292 product candidate which is in phase I testing. The values assigned to the platform
technology intangible asset and the IPR D asset were determined by estimating the costs to develop CC-292 and future product candidates into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting revenue from the potential products, and discounting the net cash flows to present value. The revenue and cost projections used were reduced based on the probability of developing new drugs.
Additionally, the projections considered the relevant market sizes, growth factors and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions. The resulting net cash flows from such potential
products are based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating expenses, and income taxes. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were commensurate with the stage of
development of the projects and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections described above. Acquired IPR D will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until
regulatory approval in specified markets or discontinuation of CC-292.   

  The
excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition. The goodwill   

  105  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  recorded
as part of the acquisition is largely attributable to full ownership rights to the Avilomics  platform. We do not expect any portion of this goodwill to be deductible for tax
purposes. The goodwill attributable to the acquisition has been recorded as a non-current asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not amortized, but is subject to review for
impairment annually.   

  Prior
to the acquisition, Avila had a number of collaboration agreements in place which we are now party to. These agreements entitle us to receive potential milestone payments and reimbursement of
expenses for research and development expenses incurred under the collaborations and our collaboration partners may receive intellectual property rights or
options to purchase such rights related to products developed under the collaborations. We do not consider these collaboration arrangements to be significant.   

     Abraxis BioScience, Inc.      

  On October 15, 2010, or the Abraxis Acquisition Date, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis BioScience, Inc., or
Abraxis, in exchange for consideration valued at the Abraxis Acquisition Date at approximately $3.205 billion, consisting of cash, stock and contingent value rights, or CVRs. The transaction,
referred to as the Merger, resulted in Abraxis becoming our wholly owned subsidiary.   

  As
discussed further under "Contingent Value Rights" below, a holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a    pro rata    portion of cash payments that we are
obligated to pay to all holders of CVRs, which is determined by achievement of certain net sales and U.S. regulatory approval milestones. Potential cash payments to CVR holders range from no payment,
if no regulatory milestones or net sales thresholds are met, to a maximum of $650.0 million in milestone payments plus payments based on annual net sales levels if all milestones are met at the
earliest target dates and annual net sales exceed threshold amounts.   

  The
Merger has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the Abraxis
Acquisition Date and requires the fair value of IPR D to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. An
aggregate $1.290 billion was the recorded value of the IPR D asset, of which $118.0 million was subsequently recognized as impaired due to a change in the probability of obtaining
progression-free survival labeling for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer for ABRAXANE  in the United States. The remaining $1.172 billion asset was
reclassified in October 2012 from an acquired IPR D intangible to an acquired developed product rights intangible asset upon the approval of ABRAXANE  for NSCLC.   

Contingent Value Rights      

  In connection with the Merger on October 15, 2010, CVRs were issued under a Contingent Value Rights Agreement, or CVR Agreement, entered into
between Celgene and American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC, as trustee. The CVRs are registered for trading on the   

  106  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  NASDAQ
Global Market under the symbol "CELGZ." The fair value of the liability of the Company related to payments under the CVR Agreement are subject to fluctuation based on trading prices for the
publicly traded CVRs. Subsequent to the Abraxis Acquisition Date, we measured the contingent consideration represented by the CVRs at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in operating
earnings.   

  Each
holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a    pro rata    portion, based on the number of CVRs then outstanding, of each of the following contingent cash
payments:   

Milestone Payment #1.     $250.0 million upon FDA
approval of ABRAXANE  for use in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, if such approval permits us to market ABRAXANE  with FDA approval that
includes a progression-free survival, or PFS, claim, but only if this milestone is achieved no later than the fifth anniversary of the Merger.     
            Milestone Payment #2.     $400.0 million (if achieved
no later than April 1, 2013) or $300.0 million (if achieved after April 1, 2013 and before the fifth anniversary of the Merger) upon FDA approval of ABRAXANE  for use
in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, if such approval permits us to market ABRAXANE  with FDA approval that includes an overall survival claim.     
            Net Sales Payments.     For each full one-year
period ending December 31 during the term of the CVR Agreement, which we refer to as a net sales measuring period (with the first net sales measuring period beginning January 1, 2011 and
ending December 31, 2011):    

2.5% of the net sales of ABRAXANE  and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed $1.000 billion but are
less than or equal to $2.000 billion for such period, plus     
           an additional amount equal to 5% of the net sales of ABRAXANE  and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed
$2.000 billion but are less than or equal to $3.000 billion for such period, plus     
           an additional amount equal to 10% of the net sales of ABRAXANE  and the Abraxis pipeline products that exceed
$3.000 billion for such period.    

No
payments will be due under the CVR Agreement with respect to net sales of ABRAXANE  and the Abraxis pipeline products after December 31, 2025, which we refer to as the net sales
payment termination date, unless net sales for the net sales measuring period ending on December 31, 2025 are equal to or greater than $1.000 billion, in which case the net sales payment
termination date will be extended until the last day of the net sales measuring period subsequent to December 31, 2025 during which net sales of ABRAXANE  and the Abraxis pipeline
products are less than $1.000 billion or, if earlier, December 31, 2030. The fair value of our liability related to the CVRs was $277.4 million at the end of 2012 compared to
$60.6 million at the end of 2011.

  In
October 2012, the FDA approved ABRAXANE  for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not
candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. The FDA approval was based on tumor response rates and did not result in the use of a marketing label that includes a progression-free
survival claim, and accordingly, the CVR Milestone Payment #1, as described above, has not been achieved. This approval resulted in the related $1.172 billion intangible asset obtained from the
Abraxis acquisition being reclassified in October 2012 from an acquired IPR D intangible to an acquired developed product rights intangible asset and amortization commenced in October 2012.   

     Sale of Non-core Assets      

  The purchase of Abraxis included a number of assets that are not associated with nab  technology or ABRAXANE . These assets,
or non-core assets, consisted of a number of subsidiaries, tangible assets, equity investments, joint venture partnerships and assets that supported research and sales of products not
directly related to the nab  technology or ABRAXANE . At the time of acquisition, we committed to a plan to divest certain non-core assets and they were classified
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 as assets held for sale and the associated liabilities were classified as liabilities of disposal group. In April 2011, we sold these
non-core assets to various entities that are owned or controlled by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the former majority shareholder and executive chairman of Abraxis.   

  We
received cash consideration of $110.0 million, 10% equity ownership in Active Biomaterials, LLC, which is an entity that was formed with certain of the non-core assets
with revenue-producing potential, and a future royalty stream based on net sales of certain products of Active Biomaterials, LLC. The royalties, which commence in 2014 at the earliest and are
not to exceed an annual amount of $128.0 million, will be calculated based on a range of between 10% and 12.5% of net sales of certain future products. Dr. Patrick
Soon-Shiong held an option to purchase the 10% equity ownership in Active Biomaterials, LLC from us for a price of $15.0 million at any time prior to April 2013 and he
exercised that option in 2012. We recorded the future royalty stream as an asset and assigned a value of $170.0 million based on its fair market value calculated as the present value of
estimated future net cash flows. The sale of the non-core assets resulted in a gain of $2.9 million which was included in the Consolidated Statements of Income, in other income
(expense), net. Our policy is to present gains and losses from sales of businesses as other income or expense.   

  Two
manufacturing and research facilities located in Melrose Park, Illinois, and the equipment associated with operations at those facilities, were sold in June of 2012 to APP
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now known as Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC), or APP, a subsidiary of Fresenius Kabi AG. APP manufactures ABRAXANE  at one of the facilities. In
exchange for the facilities, we received rights to free and reduced cost manufacturing of specified quantities of ABRAXANE , which we recorded as current or non-current
assets based on anticipated timing of delivery, a five-year rent-free lease of a portion of one of the facilities, and a net cash payment of $1.8 million. The
transaction did not result in any gain or loss. The assets and liabilities related to these two facilities were included in assets held for sale and liabilities of disposal group on the 2011
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

     Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, Inc.      

  On January 15, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock and stock options of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or
Gloucester. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Gloucester were recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values, and consolidated with our assets and liabilities.
Gloucester's results of operations are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.   

  We
paid $338.9 million in cash before milestone payments with potential additional future payments of up to $300.0 million in contingent regulatory milestone payments. As part of the
consideration for the Gloucester acquisition, we are contractually obligated to pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. We update our assumptions each reporting period
based on new developments and records such amounts at fair value until such consideration is satisfied.   

  In
June 2011, the FDA granted accelerated approval of the Supplemental New Drug Application for ISTODAX  for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, in
patients who have received at least one prior therapy. This FDA approval was the triggering event for the payment of one of the two contingent regulatory milestone payments associated with the
Gloucester acquisition. We made a payment of $180.0 million to the former shareholders of Gloucester in July 2011 in satisfaction of this milestone payment requirement.
The single remaining contingent milestone payment is for a $120.0 million cash payment upon the marketing approval for the European Union PTCL. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the
balance of the contingent consideration, which reflects the fair value of the single remaining continent milestone payment, was $17.3 million and $76.9 million, respectively, and is
included in other non-current liabilities.   

   3.     Earnings Per Share     

The total number of potential shares of common stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation because their inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive was 12,665,529 in 2012, 25,864,186 in 2011 and 24,123,172 in 2010.   

  Since
April 2009, our Board of Directors has approved repurchases of up to an aggregate of $6.500 billion of our common stock, including $2.500 billion approved by our Board of
Directors

  during
their June 2012 meeting. As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of 74,465,418 shares of common stock were repurchased under the program, including 28,636,033 shares of common stock
repurchased during 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we had a remaining open-ended repurchase authorization of $1.837 billion.   

   4.     Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurement     

  The table below presents information about assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and the valuation
techniques we utilized to determine such fair value. Fair values determined based on Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our
Level 1 assets consist of marketable equity securities. Fair values determined based on Level 2 inputs utilize observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets and observable quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not very active. Our Level 2 assets consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S.
government-sponsored agency securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, non-U.S. government, agency and Supranational securities, global corporate debt
securities, foreign currency forward contracts, purchased foreign currency options and interest rate swap contracts. Fair values determined based on Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable inputs
and include valuations of assets or liabilities for which there is little, if any, market activity. We do not have any Level 3 assets. Our Level 1 liability relates to our publicly
traded CVRs. Our Level 2 liability relates to written foreign currency options. Our Level 3 liabilities consists of contingent consideration related to undeveloped product rights
resulting from the acquisition of Gloucester and contingent consideration related to the undeveloped product rights and the technology platform acquired from the Avila acquisition. The maximum
potential payments related to the contingent consideration from the acquisitions of Gloucester and Avila are estimated to be $120.0 million and $595.0 million, respectively.

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

There were no security transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during 2012. The following tables represent a roll-forward of the fair
value of Level 3 instruments (significant unobservable inputs):   

Settlements of $22.5 million during 2011 consisted of Level 3 instruments that were considered non-core assets acquired in the
acquisition of Abraxis and were included in the sale of the non-core assets in April 2011.   

Level 3 liabilities issued during 2012 consisted of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Avila. The $50.4 million net
decrease in fair value of liabilities in 2012 was due to a $59.6 million reduction in the contingent consideration liability related to the approval of

for PTCL in Europe, partly offset by a $9.2 million increase in the accretion of the contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of Avila.   

Transfers
out of Level 3 during 2011 consisted of a $180.0 million milestone that was part of the contingent consideration in the Gloucester acquisition. This milestone was valued
based on the contractually defined amount of the milestone and paid in July 2011.   

   5.     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities     

  Our revenue and earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We manage the
impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency
option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, treasury rate lock agreements and interest rate swap contracts.   

     Foreign Currency Risk Management      

  We have established revenue hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to mitigate volatility in future foreign currency cash flows and
changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign exchange rates.   

  Through
our revenue hedging program, we endeavor to reduce the impact of possible unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates on our future U.S. dollar cash flows that are derived from foreign
currency denominated sales. To achieve this objective, we hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated sales that are expected to occur in the foreseeable future, typically within
the next three years. We manage our anticipated transaction exposure principally with foreign currency forward contracts and occasionally foreign currency put and call options.   

    Foreign Currency Forward Contracts:       We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to
reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.   

  We
enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily associated
with non-functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012
and 2011 had settlement dates within 36 months. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or losses
on them are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, and reclassified to operations in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect operations. Any
ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other income

  (expense),
net. Foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at December 31, 2012 and 2011:   

We
consider the impact of our own and the counterparties' credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract on an
ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2012, credit risk did not materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts.   

  We
also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
These foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges and, accordingly, any changes in their fair value are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income in other income
(expense), net in the current period. The aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency forward non-designated hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011
were $795.4 million and $916.9 million, respectively.   

    Foreign Currency Option Contracts:       During 2012, we began hedging a portion of our future foreign currency exposure by utilizing a strategy that involves
both a purchased local currency put option and a written local currency call option that are accounted for as hedges of future sales denominated in Euros. Specifically, we sell (or write) a local
currency call option and purchase a local currency put option with the same expiration dates and amounts but with different strike prices; this combination of transactions is generally referred to as
a "collar". The expiration dates and notional amounts correspond to the amount and timing of forecasted future foreign currency sales. If the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the currency of the hedged
anticipated sales, the purchased put option value reduces to zero and we benefit from the increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows, however this
benefit would be capped at the strike level of the written call, which forms the upper end of the collar. The premium collected from the call option partially offsets the premium paid for the
purchased put option, resulting in a net cost for the collars.   

  In
order to fully offset the net cost of the collars, we also sold local currency put options with a lower strike price and the same expiration dates and amounts as the option contracts that were used
to hedge sales. These written put options introduced risk of loss if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen beyond the strike price of the written put options. In December 2012, we entered into   

  113

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  purchased
put options that are not designated as hedges in order to partially offset the risk of loss that would be incurred on the written put options if the US dollar were to strengthen beyond the
strike price of the written put. Gains and losses associated with the non-hedge put options have been recorded on the income statement as other income (expense), net.   

Foreign
currency option contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows at December 31, 2012.   

*    U.S.
Dollar notional amounts are calculated as the hedged local currency amount multiplied times the strike value of the foreign currency option. The local
currency notional amounts of our purchased put, and written call that are designated as hedging activity are equal to each other.    

Interest Rate Risk Management      

    Treasury Rate Lock Agreements:       During 2012, we entered into treasury rate lock agreements, or treasury rate locks, in anticipation of issuing
fixed-rate notes that were issued in August 2012. With the exception of a short period in June when certain outstanding treasury rate locks were not designated as hedges, our
treasury rate locks were designated as cash flow hedges and, to the extent effective, any realized or unrealized gains or losses on them were reported in OCI and will be recognized in income over the
life of the anticipated fixed-rate notes. Treasury rate locks were settled during 2012 which resulted in losses of $35.3 million that were recorded to OCI. During the short
period in June when we had outstanding treasury rate locks that were not considered hedging instruments, we recorded the favorable change in fair value of $3.7 million in other income
(expense), net. No material amounts were recorded in income during 2012 or 2011 as a result of hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. At
December 31, 2012 we had no outstanding treasury rate locks.   

    Interest Rate Swap Contracts:       From time to time we hedge the fair value of certain debt obligations through the use of interest rate swap contracts. The interest
rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in interest rates. Since the specific terms and notional amount of the swap are intended to
match those of the debt being hedged, it is assumed to be a highly effective hedge and all changes in fair value of the swap is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with no net impact recorded
in income. Any net interest payments made or received on interest rate swap contracts are recognized as interest expense.   

  114

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  In
2011, we settled outstanding interest rate swap contracts we entered into with respect to our $500.0 million 2.45% fixed notes due in 2015 resulting in the receipt of $34.3 million.
The proceeds from the settlements are being accounted for as a reduction of current and future interest expense associated with these notes. During 2012, we terminated the hedging relationship on
$800.0 million notional amount of swap contracts that had been entered into earlier in 2012 as hedges of our 1.9% fixed rate notes due in 2017 and our 3.25% fixed rate notes due in 2022 by
settling certain of the contracts and entering into offsetting contracts for those not settled. This resulted in gains of $5.0 million that are being accounted for as a reduction of current and
future interest expense associated with these notes.   

  At
December 31, 2012, we were a party to pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the
notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes. Our swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012 consisted of $100.0 million aggregate notional amount
maturing in 2017, which effectively convert a portion of our $500.0 million, 1.90% fixed-rate notes due in 2017 to a floating rate and $200.0 million aggregate notional
amount maturing in 2022, which effectively converts a portion of our $1.000 billion, 3.25% fixed-rate notes due in 2022 to a floating rate.   

In
January 2013 we entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of $400 million related to our 1.90% fixed-rate notes due in 2017 and
$800 million related to our 3.25% fixed-rate notes due in 2022.

    Intangible Assets:       Our intangible assets consist of developed product rights obtained primarily from the Pharmion, Gloucester and Abraxis acquisitions, IPR D
product rights from the Gloucester and Avila acquisitions and technology obtained primarily from the Avila acquisition. Also included are contract-based licenses and other miscellaneous intangibles.
The amortization periods related to non-IPR D intangible assets range from one to 17 years. The following

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  summary
of intangible assets by category includes intangibles currently being amortized and intangibles not yet subject to amortization:   

The
gross carrying value of intangible assets increased by $451.9 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the acquisition of Avila, which resulted in a net increase of
$460.0 million in the gross carrying value of intangible assets, after recognizing a $69.2 million impairment charge related to an adjustment to the probability weighted forecasted sales
of CC-292 compared to estimates at date of acquisition. The gross carrying value of intangible assets also included a $42.4 million acquisition of intellectual property rights
related to an approved product acquired from Deuteria Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Deuteria, in 2012 and $53.3 million in impairment charges related to the IPR D product right for
ISTODAX  for PTCL in Europe following a negative opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, for the Marketing Authorization
Application submitted for ISTODAX  for the treatment of PTCL.   

  122  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  Acquired
developed product rights increased by $1.214 billion primarily due to a $1.172 billion reclassification of acquired IPR D product right assets related to ABRAXANE 
following the 2012 FDA approval of ABRAXANE  for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or
metastatic NSCLC in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. Technology increased by $330.8 million due to the acquisition of
Avila and its Avilomics  platform. The $2.8 million increase in other intangible assets resulted from certain third-party agreements entered into during 2012. Acquired IPR D rights
decreased by $1.096 billion primarily due to the $1.172 billion transfer to acquired developed product rights and $53.3 million of impairment charges related to the IPR D product
right for ISTODAX . The decrease was partly offset by a net increase of $129.2 million resulting from the acquisition of Avila, which included the impact of a $69.2 million
impairment charge related to an adjustment to the probability weighted forecasted sales of CC-292 compared to estimates at date of acquisition.   

  Amortization
expense was $196.2 million, $290.3 million and $204.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization expense
decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the 2011 inclusion of amortization related to Vidaza in the U.S., which became fully amortized during 2011, partly offset by amortization related to
the Avila intangible assets acquired in 2012 and the initiation of amortization related to ABRAXANE  in late 2012 as noted above. Assuming no changes in the gross carrying amount of
intangible assets, the amortization of intangible assets for years 2013 through 2017 is estimated to be in the range of approximately $255.0 million to $270.0 million annually.   

    Goodwill:       At December 31, 2012, our goodwill related to the 2012 acquisition of Avila, the 2010 acquisitions of Abraxis and Gloucester, the 2008 acquisition
of Pharmion and the 2004 acquisition of Penn T Limited.   

  The
change in carrying value of goodwill is summarized as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)     

  At December 31, 2012, the fair value of our outstanding Senior Notes was $2.893 billion and represented a Level 2 measurement within the fair value
measurement hierarchy.   

  In
August 2012, we issued an additional $1.500 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.90% Senior Notes due 2017, or the
2017 notes, and $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes" and, together with the 2017 notes, referred to herein as the "2012 issued notes"). The
2012 issued notes were issued at 99.786% and 99.949% of par, respectively, and the discount is being amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity. Offering
costs of approximately $11.7 million have been recorded as debt issuance costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized as additional interest expense using the effective
interest rate method over the period from issuance through maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year
beginning February 15, 2013 and the principal on each note is due in full at their respective maturity dates. The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any
time at a redemption price defined in a make-whole clause equaling accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of
the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2017
notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2022 notes. If we experience a change of control accompanied by a downgrade of the debt to below investment grade, we will be required to offer to
repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We are subject to covenants which limit our ability to
pledge properties as security under borrowing arrangements and limit our ability to perform sale and leaseback transactions involving our property.   

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, we entered into or treasury rate locks in anticipation of issuing the fixed-rate notes that were issued in August 2012. Losses related to
these treasury rate locks of $35.3 million have been recorded in OCI during the year ended December 31, 2012 and will be recognized as interest expense over the life of the 2017 notes
and the 2022 notes.   

  At
December 31, 2012, we were party to pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional
amounts matched the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes. Our swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012 consist of $100.0 million aggregate notional amount maturing in
2017, which effectively converts a portion of our $500.0 million, 1.90% fixed-rate notes due in 2017 to a floating rate and $200.0 million aggregate notional amount maturing
in 2022, which effectively converts a portion of our $1.000 billion, 3.25% fixed-rate notes due in 2022 to a floating rate. In August 2011, we settled outstanding interest rate swap
contracts we entered into with respect to our $500.0 million, 2.45% fixed-rate notes due in 2015 resulting in the receipt of $34.3 million. The proceeds from the settlements
are being accounted for as a reduction of current and future interest expense associated with these notes.

Senior Unsecured Credit Facility:       We maintain a senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, that provides revolving credit in the aggregate
amount of $1.000 billion. Amounts may be borrowed in U.S. dollars for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. The Credit Facility serves as backup liquidity for our
Commercial Paper
borrowings. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there was no outstanding borrowing against the Credit Facility.   

  The
Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including certain customary financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants as of December 31, 2012.   

Credit Facility:       In November 2011, we entered into an uncommitted facility, or the Facility, not exceeding an aggregate $125.0 million. As of
December 31, 2011, $125.0 million was outstanding under the Facility and accounted for as short-term borrowings. The outstanding balance was repaid in January 2012 and the
Facility was canceled.

    Preferred Stock:       Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, at any time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and
to determine the price, rights, privileges, and preferences of such shares.   

    Common Stock:       At December 31, 2012, we were authorized to issue up to 575,000,000 shares of common stock of which shares of common stock issued totaled
498,427,951.   

    Treasury Stock:       Since April 2009, our Board of Directors has approved repurchases of up to an aggregate $6.500 billion of our common stock, including
$2.500 billion approved by our Board of Directors during their June 2012 meeting. We repurchased $2.050 billion, $2.220 billion, and $183.1 million of treasury stock under
the program in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively , excluding transaction fees. As of December 31, 2012 an aggregate 74,465,418 common shares
were repurchased under the program at an average price of $62.62 per common share and total cost of $4.663 billion.   

  Certain
employees exercised stock options containing a reload feature and, pursuant to our stock option plan, tendered mature shares of 14,865 in 2012, 81,281 in 2011 and 152,361 in 2010 related to
stock option exercises. Such tendered shares are reflected as treasury stock. In addition, when employee awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, vest and are settled net in order to fulfill tax
withholding requirements, the shares withheld are reflected as treasury stock.

  The
accumulated balances related to each component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, are summarized as follows:   

14.   Share-Based Compensation     

  We have a stockholder-approved stock incentive plan, the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan as amended and restated in 2009, and further amended in 2011 and 2012, or the Plan, which
provides for the granting of options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other share-based awards to our employees and officers. The Management Compensation and
Development Committee of the Board of Directors, or the Compensation Committee, may determine the type, amount and terms, including vesting, of any awards made under the Plan.   

On
June 13, 2012, our stockholders approved an amendment of the Plan, which included the following key modifications: adoption of an aggregate share reserve of 95,981,641 shares of Common
Stock, which includes an increase in the share reserve by 14,000,000 shares; extension of the term of the plan through April 18, 2022; a change in the weighting of full-value awards
such as restricted stock and restricted stock units such that the weighting of grants of full-value awards will be increased from 1.6 shares for every share granted to 2.1 shares for every
share granted for purposes of determining usage of the aggregate share reserve.   

  With
respect to options granted under the Plan, the exercise price may not be less than the market closing price of the common stock on the date of grant. In general, options granted under the Plan
vest over periods ranging from immediate vesting to four-year vesting and expire ten years from the date of grant, subject to earlier expiration in case of termination of employment unless
the participant meets the retirement provision under which the option would have a maximum of three additional years to vest. The vesting period for options granted under the Plan is subject to
certain acceleration provisions if a change in control, as defined in the Plan, occurs. Plan participants may elect to exercise options at any time during the option term. However, any shares so
purchased which have not vested as of the date of exercise shall be subject to forfeiture, which will lapse in accordance with the established vesting time period.   

Shares
of common stock available for future share-based grants under all plans were 19,524,592 at December 31, 2012.

$155.2 million, $154.4 million and $142.6 million, respectively. Share-based compensation cost
included in inventory was $1.2 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We do not recognize a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits that have not
been realized and have adopted the tax law method as its accounting policy regarding the ordering of tax benefits to determine whether an excess tax benefit has been realized.   

Stock Options:       Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $476.2 million,
$166.5 million and $86.9 million, respectively, and the excess tax benefit recognized was $49.3 million, $31.1 million and $36.1 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2012, there was $299.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the plans. That cost will be recognized over an expected
remaining weighted-average period of 2.3 years.   

  The
weighted-average grant date fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $19.33 per share, $17.09 per share and $18.59 per share,
respectively. We estimated the fair value of options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:   

The
risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon curve. Expected volatility of stock option awards is estimated based on the implied
volatility of our publicly traded options with settlement dates of six months. The use of implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and the
assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The expected term of an

  employee
share option is the period of time for which the option is expected to be outstanding. We made a determination of expected term by analyzing employees' historical exercise experience from its
history of grants and exercises in our option database and management estimates. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data.   

  The
following table summarizes all stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2012:   

The
total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $144.1 million, $162.8 million and $149.0 million,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $293.5 million, $147.9 million and
$109.6 million, respectively. We primarily utilize newly issued shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options.   

  Stock
options granted to executives at the vice-president level and above under the Plan, formerly the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, after September 18, 2000, contained a reload
feature which provided that if (1) the optionee exercises all or any portion of the stock option (a) at least six months prior to the expiration of the stock option, (b) while
employed by the Company and (c) prior to the expiration date of the Plan and (2) the optionee pays the exercise price for the portion of the stock option exercised or the minimum
statutory applicable withholding taxes by using common stock owned by the optionee for at least six months prior to the date of exercise, the optionee shall be granted a new stock option under the
Plan on the date all or any portion of the stock option is exercised to purchase the number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock exchanged by the optionee. The
reload stock option is exercisable on the same terms and conditions as apply to the original stock option except that   

  129  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  (x) the
reload stock option will become exercisable in full on the day which is six months after the date the original stock option is exercised, (y) the exercise price shall be the fair
value (as defined in the Plan) of the common stock on the date the reload stock option is granted and (z) the expiration of the reload stock option will be the date of expiration of the
original stock option. As of December 31, 2012, 65,144 options that contain the reload features noted above are still outstanding and are included in the tables above. The Plan was amended to
eliminate the reload feature for all stock options granted on or after October 1, 2004.   

    Restricted Stock Units:       We issue restricted stock units, or RSUs, under our equity program in order to provide an effective incentive award with a strong retention
component. Equity awards may, at the option of employee participants, be divided between stock options and RSUs. The employee may choose between alternate Company defined mixes of stock options and
RSUs, with the number of RSUs to be granted based on a three-to-one ratio of stock options to RSUs. Information regarding the Company's RSUs for the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:   

As
of December 31, 2012, there was $176.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards of RSUs. That cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. The Company primarily utilizes newly issued shares to satisfy the vesting of RSUs.   

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units:       The Company's performance-based restricted stock units vest contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined
performance-based milestones   

  130

  typically
related to product development. The following table summarizes the Company's performance-based restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2012:   

As
of December 31, 2012, there was $0.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards of performance-based RSUs that is
expected to be recognized over a period of 1.0 years.   

   15.   Employee Benefit Plans     

  We sponsor an employee savings and retirement plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or the Code, for its U.S. employees.
Our contributions to the U.S. savings plan are discretionary and have historically been made in the form of our common stock (See Note 12). Such contributions are based on specified percentages
of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation or a maximum permitted by law. Total expense for contributions to the U.S. savings plans were $19.3 million, $20.7 million and
$14.4 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain foreign locations.   

  Participation
in these plans is subject to the local laws that are in effect for each country and may include statutorily imposed minimum contributions. The Company also maintains defined benefit
plans in certain foreign locations for which the obligations and the net periodic pension costs were determined to be immaterial at December 31, 2012.   

In
2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a deferred compensation plan. The plan was frozen effective as of December 31, 2004, and no additional contributions or deferrals can be made
to that plan. Accrued benefits under the frozen plan will continue to be governed by the terms under the tax laws in effect prior to the enactment of Section 409A. In February 2005, the
Company's Board of Directors adopted the Celgene Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, effective as of January 1, 2005, and amended the plan in February 2008. This plan operates as the
Company's ongoing deferred compensation plan and is intended to comply with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Section 409A. Eligible participants, which include certain
top-level executives of the Company as specified by the plan, can elect to defer up to an amended 90% of the participant's base salary, 100% of cash bonuses and equity compensation allowed   

  131  

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  under
Section 409A of the Code. Company contributions to the deferred compensation plan represent a match to certain participants' deferrals up to a specified percentage, which currently ranges
from 10% to 20%, depending on the employee's position as specified in the plan, of the participant's base salary. The Company recorded expense of $0.6 million, $0.7 million and
$0.5 million related to the deferred compensation plans in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company's recurring matches are fully vested, upon contribution. All other Company
contributions to the plan do not vest until the specified requirements are met. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had a deferred compensation liability included in other
non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of approximately $59.8 million and $50.8 million, respectively, which included the participant's elected deferral
of salaries and bonuses, the Company's matching contribution and earnings on deferred amounts as of that date. The plan provides various alternatives for the measurement of earnings on the amounts
participants defer under the plan. The measuring alternatives are based on returns of a variety of funds that offer plan participants the option to spread their risk across a diverse group of
investments.   

  In
2003, the Company established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon
achievement of pre-established corporate
performance objectives covering a three-year period. We currently have three separate three-year performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31, 2013, 2014
and 2015. Performance measures for the performance cycle ending in 2013 are based on the following components in the last year of the three-year cycle: 25% on non-GAAP earnings
per share; 25% on non-GAAP net income; and 50% on total non-GAAP revenue, as defined. The performance cycles ending in 2014 and 2015 are based on the following components:
37.5% on non-GAAP earnings per share; 37.5% on total non-GAAP revenue, as defined; and 25% on relative total shareholder return, which is a measurement of our stock price
performance during the year compared with a group of other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.   

  Payouts
may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participant's salary for the LTIPs. The estimated payout for the concluded 2012 Plan is $8.8 million, which is included in accrued expenses at
December 31, 2012, and the maximum potential payout, assuming maximum objectives are achieved for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 Plans are $18.4 million, $19.6 million and
$22.6 million, respectively. Such awards are payable in cash or common stock or a mixture of cash and common stock, which will be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of award
delivery. For awards payable in common stock, the number of shares is determined using the average closing price for the 30 trading days prior to the beginning of the cycle. Payments made in common
stock are restricted from trading for a period of three years. We accrue the long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end of a
three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to
their target award or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized expense
related to the LTIP of $10.1 million, $12.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively.

16.   Income Taxes     

  The income tax provision is based on income before income taxes as follows:   

For
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, U.S. income before income taxes reflects charges related to share-based compensation, up-front collaboration
payments, and acquisitions. These charges were less significant outside the U.S.   

  The
provision (benefit) for taxes on income is as follows:   

Amounts
are reflected in the preceding tables based on the location of the taxing authorities. We do not provide for U.S. federal or state income taxes on unremitted earnings of our
international subsidiaries that are indefinitely invested outside the United States. As of December 31, 2012, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on $4.300 billion of unremitted
earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are expected to be reinvested overseas indefinitely, it is not practicable to compute the estimated deferred tax liability on these
earnings.   

  Deferred
taxes arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as temporary differences. We record the tax effect on these temporary differences
as deferred tax assets (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future periods) or deferred tax liabilities (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but that
have not yet been recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income). We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these
deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred   

  133  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  tax
assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, tax
planning strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, it was more likely than not that we would realize our
deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. The principal valuation allowance relates to Swiss deferred tax assets.   

  During
2012, we concluded that approximately $900.0 million of our foreign earnings may not be required for use in offshore operations and may be available for use in the United States. These
earnings are no longer treated as permanently reinvested, and accordingly, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $316.5 million for the estimated U.S. federal and state income taxes that may
be incurred should these earnings be repatriated. In drawing this conclusion, we
considered our future sources of funds as well as our global operating and strategic liquidity needs, including common share repurchase activities and expansion of our commercial, research,
manufacturing and administrative infrastructure worldwide.   

  At
December 31, 2012 and 2011 the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:   

134  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified on the Company's balance sheet as follows:   

Reconciliation
of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate is as follows:   

We
have operations in many foreign tax jurisdictions, which impose income taxes at different rates than the U.S. The impact of these rate differences is included in the foreign tax rate differences
that we disclose in our reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate. The benefit related to foreign tax rate differences primarily results from our commercial
operations in Switzerland, which include significant research and development and manufacturing for worldwide markets. We operate under an income tax holiday in Switzerland through 2015 that exempts
us from Swiss income taxes on most of our operations in Switzerland. The impact of the Swiss tax holiday is reflected in our effective tax rate. The difference between the maximum statutory Swiss
income tax rate (approximately 21% in 2012, and 22% in 2011 and 2010) and our Swiss income tax rate under the tax holiday resulted in a reduction in the 2012, 2011 and 2010 effective tax rates of
26.6, 20.2 and 15.8 percentage points, respectively. The increase in benefits reflected in the foreign tax rate differences from 2010 to 2012 results from growth in our Non-US
operations and an increase in the proportion of consolidated income before income taxes from Non-U.S. operations.   

At
December 31, 2012, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $3.5 million and combined state NOL carryforwards of approximately $380.8 million that will
expire in the years 2013 through 2032. We also have research and experimentation credit carryforwards of   

  135  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  approximately
$13.9 million that will expire in the years 2017 through 2030. Excess tax benefits related to stock option deductions incurred after December 31, 2005 are required to be
recognized in the period in which the tax deduction is realized through a reduction of income taxes payable. As a result, we have not recorded deferred tax assets for certain stock option deductions
included in our state NOL carryforwards and research and experimentation credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2012, deferred tax assets have not been recorded on state NOL carryforwards of
approximately $137.8 million and for research and experimentation
credits of approximately $8.8 million. These stock option tax benefits will be recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital when realized.   

We
realized stock option deduction benefits in 2012, 2011 and 2010 for income tax purposes and have increased additional paid-in capital in the amount of approximately
$55.8 million, $25.1 million and $32.5 million, respectively. We have recorded deferred income taxes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income resulting in a
deferred income tax asset at December 31, 2012 of $17.3 million and a deferred income tax asset at December 31, 2011 of $1.6 million.   

  Our
tax returns are under routine examination in many taxing jurisdictions. The scope of these examinations includes, but is not limited to, the review of our taxable presence in a jurisdiction, our
deduction of certain items, our claims for research and development credits, our compliance with transfer pricing rules and regulations and the inclusion or exclusion of amounts from our tax returns
as filed. During 2012, we settled an examination with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Our U.S. federal income tax returns
have now been audited by the IRS through the year ended December 31, 2008. Tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011 are currently under examination by the IRS.
We are also subject to audits by various state and foreign taxing authorities, including, but not limited to, most U.S. states and major European and Asian countries where we have operations.   

  We
regularly reevaluate our tax positions and the associated interest and penalties, if applicable, resulting from audits of federal, state and foreign income tax filings, as well as changes in tax
law (including regulations, administrative pronouncements, judicial precedents, etc.) that would reduce the technical merits of the position to below more likely than not. We believe that our accruals
for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years. Many factors are considered in making these evaluations, including past history, recent interpretations of tax law and the specifics of each
matter. Because tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain, these evaluations can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates and assumptions, which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and
subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the IRS and other taxing authorities, as well as our industry experience. These evaluations are based on estimates and assumptions that have been
deemed reasonable by management. However, if management's estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted.   

  136  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  Unrecognized
tax benefits, generally represented by liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and all subject to tax examinations, arise when the estimated benefit recorded in the financial
statements differs from the amounts taken or expected to be taken in a tax return because of the uncertainties described above. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows:   

These
unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations. If recognized, unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $157.9 million would have a net
impact on the effective tax rate. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest at December 31, 2012 and
2011 is approximately $18.0 million and $53.2 million, respectively.   

  During
2012, we settled examinations with various taxing authorities related to tax positions taken in prior years. The settlements resulted in a decrease in our gross unrecognized tax benefits of
$450.6 million, exclusive of interest, and a reduction to income tax expense of $318.6 million. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits and the reduction to income tax expense reflect
the impact of the settlements on tax returns filed in various taxing jurisdictions for the years examined as well as certain adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits for years subsequent to the
examination period. We have also recorded changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for prior years related to ongoing income tax audits in various taxing jurisdictions.   

  The
liability for unrecognized tax benefits is expected to increase in the next 12 months relating to operations occurring in that period. Any settlements of examinations with taxing
authorities or statute of limitations expirations would likely result in a decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits. Our estimates of tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative
of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire.

17.   Collaboration Agreements     

  We have entered into a variety of alliances in the ordinary course of our business. Although we do not consider any individual alliance to be material, the following is a brief
description of certain of the more notable alliances:   

    Novartis Pharma AG:       We licensed the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) regarding certain chirally pure forms of methylphenidate for FOCALIN  and
FOCALIN XR  to Novartis. We also licensed to Novartis the rights related to long-acting formulations of methylphenidate and dex-methylphenidate products which are
used in FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA . As a result of the grant of these licenses we sell FOCALIN  to Novartis and receive royalties of between 30% and 35% on their
sales of FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA . Under the agreement, we have received upfront and regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling $55.0 million.   

  The
agreement will continue until the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial launch on a country-by-country basis or (ii) when the last
applicable patent expires with respect to that country. At the expiration date, we will grant Novartis a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make, have made, use,
import and sell products using the dex-methylphenidate and long-acting formulation technology.   

  The
agreement may be terminated by Novartis upon 12 months' prior written notice or by either party upon, among other things, the material breach of the other or in the event of withdrawal of
the dex-methylphenidate product or RITALIN  product from the market because of regulatory mandate.   

  If
the agreement is terminated by us, then all licenses granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate and Novartis will grant us a non-exclusive license to certain of their
intellectual property related to the compounds and products. If the agreement is terminated by Novartis then all licenses granted to Novartis under the agreement will terminate.   

  When
generic versions of long-acting methylphenidate hydrochloride and dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride enter the market, we expect Novartis' sales of RITALIN LA  and FOCALIN
XR  products to decrease and therefore its royalties under this agreement to also decrease. In January 2012, Actavis Group announced the launch of a generic version of RITALIN
LA .   

    Array BioPharma Inc.:       We have a research collaboration agreement with Array BioPharma Inc., or Array, focused on the discovery, development and
commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation. As part of this agreement, we made payments to date in the aggregate amount of $59.0 million, which were recorded as research
and development expense, in return for an option to purchase exclusive worldwide rights for compounds developed against up to two research targets defined in the agreement. Array will be responsible
for all discovery and clinical development through phase I or phase IIa for each compound. Potential milestone payments for each compound of approximately $200.0 million (most of
which are payable subsequent to exercise of the relevant option) if certain discovery, development and regulatory milestones are   

  138  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  achieved,
and $300.0 million if certain commercial milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on net sales.   

  During
2012 we exercised our option to extend the term of the agreement for an additional year. Our option will now terminate upon the earlier of (i) a termination of the agreement by its
terms, (ii) the date we have exercised our options for compounds developed against two of the four research targets identified, or (iii) September 21, 2013. We may unilaterally
extend the option term for an additional one-year term until September 21, 2014. During 2012, we made a $3.0 million payment to Array in order to extend the research
activities on one of the compounds.   

  If
we exercise the options for each compound, upon the expiration of the research collaboration agreement under certain circumstances, Array will grant us a fully paid-up,
royalty-free license to use certain intellectual property of Array to market and sell the compounds and products developed under the agreement.   

    Acceleron Pharma:       We entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with Acceleron for the joint development and commercialization of sotatercept, or
ACE-011, currently being studied for treatment of renal anemia. The collaboration agreement, as amended, combines both companies' resources and commitment to developing products for the
treatment of cancer and cancer-related bone loss, and expands the joint development, manufacturing and commercialization of Acceleron's products to include anemia exclusivity. Under the terms of the
ACE-011 agreement, we and Acceleron will jointly develop, manufacture and commercialize Acceleron's products for the treatment of bone loss. We made a payment to Acceleron in February 2008
of $50.0 million, which included a $5.0 million equity investment in Acceleron Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, with the remainder recorded as research and
development expense. In December 2011, we made a $25.0 million equity investment in Acceleron Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. In the event of an initial public offering of
Acceleron, we will purchase a minimum of $7.0 million of Acceleron common stock. We have agreed to pay all development costs related to ACE-011 incurred after January 1,
2013.   

  Acceleron
is eligible to receive development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones of up to $367.0 million for the ACE-011 program and up to an additional
$348.0 million for each of three specific discovery stage programs. The parties also agreed to co-promote the products under the ACE-011 agreement in North America.
Acceleron will receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales upon the commercialization of a development compound. We made a $7.0 million development milestone payment to Acceleron in April
2011 for the initiation of enrollment into a phase II study for chemotherapy-induced anemia.   

  In
August 2011, we also entered into a collaboration, license and option agreement with Acceleron, for the joint development and commercialization of ACE-536 for the treatment of anemia.
The ACE-536 agreement also includes an option for future Acceleron anemia programs. The ACE-536 agreement provides us with an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to
the ACE-536 program and future Acceleron programs for the treatment of anemia. The parties also agreed to co-promote the products under the ACE-536 agreement in the
United States, Canada and Mexico.   

  139  

Table of Contents    

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)     

  In connection with the ACE-536 agreement, we made a payment to Acceleron in the amount of $25.0 million. We have also agreed to pay all development costs
incurred after January 1, 2013. Acceleron is eligible to receive development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones of up to $217.5 million for the ACE-536 program
and up to an additional $170.8 million for the first discovery stage program, $148.8 million for the second discovery stage program and $125.4 million for each additional
discovery stage program thereafter. In October 2011, we made a $7.5 million milestone payment for the initiation of a phase I clinical study of ACE-536. A
$10.0 million milestone payment will be made for the January 2013 initiation of a phase II clinical study to evaluate ACE-536 for the treatment of anemia in patients with
myelodysplastic syndromes. Acceleron will receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales upon the commercialization of a development compound.   

The
agreements for ACE-011 and ACE-536 may be terminated by us, at our sole discretion, at any time for the ACE-011 agreement, and, with respect to the
ACE-536 agreement, after completion of the initial phase II clinical trials, or by either party, among other things, upon a material breach by the other party.   

    GlobeImmune, Inc.:       We entered into a collaboration and option agreement with GlobeImmune Inc., or GlobeImmune, as amended, focused on the discovery,
development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer. As part of this agreement, we made a
payment in May 2009 of $30.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expense, in return for the option to license certain compounds and products based on the
GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-6300 oncology drug candidate programs, as well as oncology compounds and products resulting from future programs
controlled by GlobeImmune. If the option is exercised, GlobeImmune will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments of approximately $230.0 million for the GI-4000 program,
$145.0 million for each of the GI-6200 and GI-3000 programs and $161.0 million for each of the GI-6300 program and each additional future program if
certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones are achieved. GlobeImmune will also receive tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.   

  Our
options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-6300 oncology drug candidate programs will terminate if we do not exercise our
respective options after delivery of certain reports from GlobeImmune on the completed clinical trials with respect to each drug candidate program. If we do not exercise our options with respect to
any drug candidate program or future program, our option with respect to the oncology products resulting from future programs controlled by GlobeImmune will terminate three years after the last of the
options with respect to the GI-4000, GI-6200, GI-3000 and GI-6300 oncology drug candidate programs terminates.   

    Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:       On April 14, 2010, we entered into a discovery and development collaboration and license agreement with Agios
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Agios, which focuses on cancer metabolism targets and the discovery, development and commercialization of associated therapeutics. As part of the agreement, as
amended, we paid Agios $121.2 million, which was recorded by us as research and development expense. We also made an $8.8 million equity investment in Agios Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock. In October 2011, we made a $20.0 million payment to Agios for a one year extension of our oncology collaboration and   

  140

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  licensing
agreement and in November 2011, made a $28.7 million investment in Agios series C-2 Convertible Preferred Stock. With respect to each product in a program that we
choose to license, Agios could receive up to $120.0 million upon achievement of certain milestones plus royalties on sales, and Agios may also participate in the development and
commercialization of certain products in the United States. Agios may also receive a one-time milestone payment of $25.0 million upon dosing of the final
human subject in a phase II study, such payment to be made only once with respect to only one program. Our option will terminate on April 14, 2014.   

We
have determined that Agios is a variable interest entity; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of Agios. Although we would have the right to receive the benefits from the collaboration and
license agreement, we do not have the power to direct the activities under the collaboration and license agreement as Agios has the decision-making authority for the Joint Steering Committee and Joint
Research Committee until we exercise our option to license a product. Our interest in Agios is limited to our equity ownership and we do not have any obligations or rights to the future losses or
returns of Agios beyond this ownership.   

    Epizyme:       In April 2012, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Epizyme, Inc., or Epizyme, to discover, develop and commercialize novel
therapeutic compounds by inhibiting histone methyltransferases, or HMTs, an important epigenetic target class.   

  Under
the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $65.0 million to Epizyme and also made a $25.0 million equity investment in Epizyme Series C Preferred Stock. If
the option is exercised, Epizyme could receive up to $165.0 million in milestone payments associated with each Epizyme compound developed to inhibit each distinct HMT target under the
collaboration plus royalties on sales. Under this agreement, we have the exclusive option to license rights to HMT targets outside the United States and each Epizyme compound associated with such
target during the option term. Epizyme will have the sole responsibility to develop and commercialize compounds in the United States.   

The
option term expires on either July 9, 2015, or July 9, 2016 if we unilaterally extend the option term for a fourth year and pay an option extension fee. Further, if an HMT target or
targets are selected then the agreement will expire upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms under the agreement with respect to all licensed Epizyme compounds. Upon the expiration of the
agreement, we will have a fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use Epizyme intellectual property to manufacture, market, use and sell such licensed Epizyme compounds
developed under the agreement outside the United States.   

    Other Collaboration Arrangements in 2012:       In addition to the collaboration arrangements described above, we entered into a number of collaborative arrangements
during 2012 that resulted in $34.5 million of assets for investments in equity or other assets and research and
development expenses of $113.5 million. These additional arrangements entered into during 2012 include the potential for future milestone payments of up to an aggregate $1.420 billion
related to the attainment of specified development and regulatory approval milestones over a period of several years. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in
the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events which could cause the   

  141  

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  discontinuance
of the programs. We do not consider these collaboration arrangements to be significant.   

18.   Commitments and Contingencies     

    Leases:       The Company leases offices and research facilities under various operating lease agreements in the United States and international markets. At
December 31, 2012, the non-cancelable lease terms for the operating leases expire at various dates between 2013 and 2023 and include renewal options. In general, the Company is also
required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases.   

  Future
minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2012 are:   

Total
rental expense under operating leases was approximately $41.9 million in 2012, $48.1 million in 2011 and $36.4 million in 2010.   

    Lines of Credit:       The Company maintains lines of credit with several banks to support its hedging programs and to facilitate the issuance of bank letters of credit
and guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries. Lines of credit supporting the Company's hedging programs as of December 31, 2012 allowed the Company to enter into derivative contracts with
settlement dates through 2015. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has entered into derivative contracts with net notional amounts totaling $3.400 billion. Lines of credit facilitating
the issuance of bank letters of credit and guarantees as of December 31, 2012 allowed the Company to have letters of credit and guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries totaling
$59.4 million.   

    Other Commitments:       The Company's obligations related to product supply contracts totaled $64.1 million at December 31, 2012. The Company also owns an
interest in three limited partnership investment funds and has committed to invest an additional $5.4 million, which is callable any time within a ten-year period from the date of
original investment.   

  In
addition, under an agreement with the Institute for Advanced Health, later renamed The Chan Soon-Shiong Institute for Advanced Health, or the CSS Institute, we are committed to   

  142  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  make
certain payments, including future contingent matching contributions and an additional milestone-based contingent contribution. The CSS Institute is a non-profit organization
dedicated to research and technology development in personalized molecular medicine of which Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Under the terms of
the agreement, we made an initial contribution during 2011 with a value of $41.0 million. The agreement provides for two additional contributions of $25.0 million to be made by us based
on like amounts of other third-party contributions being received by the CSS Institute and a $25.0 million milestone-based contribution contingent upon the CSS Institute achieving specified
results related to the collection of DNA data and genomic sequences and the initiation of research and development alliances to be achieved before December 31, 2015. During 2012, we terminated
an associated agreement with aggregate remaining payments of up to $150 million, resulting in the forfeiture of our previous rights under the agreement with the CSS Institute. In the event that
payment of these contributions becomes probable, they will be recorded as selling general and administrative expense. No additional contributions have been made as of December 31, 2012.   

    Collaboration Arrangements:       We have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements, as identified in Note 17, with third parties
that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of
pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any
adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the future potential payments are inherently uncertain, and accordingly no
amounts have been recorded for these future potential payments in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011.   

    Contingencies:       We believe we maintain insurance coverage adequate for our current needs. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which
impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We review the effects of such
laws and regulations on our operations and modify our operations as appropriate. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.   

     Legal Proceedings:      

  We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, trademark, commercial and other claims; government investigations; and other legal
proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of
information requests from government authorities, and we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations and legal
proceedings are difficult to predict, adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, product recalls, incurrence of
costs and payment of   

  143  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  significant
penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.   

  Pending
patent proceedings include challenges to the scope, validity or enforceability of our patents relating to certain of our products or processes. Although we believe we have substantial defenses
to these challenges with respect to all our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection
for the drug at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that product and could materially affect future results of operations.   

  Among
the principal matters pending to which we are a party are the following:   

  In
the fourth quarter of 2009, we received a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC. The FTC requested documents and other information relating to
requests by generic companies to purchase our patented REVLIMID  and THALOMID  brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to believe that we have engaged in
unfair methods of competition. In the first quarter of 2010, the State of Connecticut referenced the same issues as those referenced in the 2009 CID and issued a subpoena. In the fourth quarter of
2010, we received a second CID from the FTC relating to this matter. We continue to respond to requests for information.   

  In
the first quarter of 2011, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California informed us that they are investigating possible off-label marketing and improper
payments to physicians in connection with the sales of THALOMID  and REVLIMID . In the third quarter of 2012, we learned that two other United States Attorneys' offices (the
Northern District of Alabama and the Eastern District of Texas) and various state Attorneys General are conducting related investigations. We are cooperating with these investigations.   

    REVLIMID :       We have publicly announced that we received a Notice Letter dated August 30, 2010, sent from Natco Pharma Limited of India ("Natco")
notifying us of Natco's Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, which contains Paragraph IV certifications against certain of Celgene's patents that are listed in the U.S. Federal Drug
Administration's, or FDA,    Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations    (the "Orange Book") for REVLIMID  (lenalidomide).
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA containing a certification (a "Paragraph IV certification") challenging the validity or infringement of a patent
listed in the Orange Book. Natco's Notice letter alleges, among other things, that certain claims of United States Patent Nos. 5,635,517 (the "'517 patent"), 6,045,501 (the "'501 patent"),
6,315,720 (the "'720 patent"), 6,555,554 (the "'554 patent"), 6,561,976 (the "'976 patent"), 6,561,977 (the "'977 patent"), 6,755,784 (the "'784 patent"), 7,119,106 (the "'106 patent") and 7,465,800
(the "800 patent") are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed. Natco's Notice Letter was sent in connection with its filing of an ANDA seeking permission from the FDA to market a generic version
of 25mg, 15mg, 10mg and 5mg REVLIMID  capsules.   

  On
October 8, 2010, we filed an infringement action in the United States District Court of New Jersey against Natco in response to the Notice Letter with respect to the '517 patent, the '501   

  144  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  patent,
United States Patent No. 6,281,230 (the "'230 patent"), the '720 patent, the '554 patent, the '976 patent, the '977 patent, the '784 patent, the '106 patent and the '800 patent.   

  Natco
responded to our infringement action on November 18, 2010, with its Answer, Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims. Natco has alleged (through Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims) that
the patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed by Natco's proposed generic products. After filing the infringement action, we learned the identity of Natco's U.S. partner, Arrow
International Limited ("Arrow"), and filed an amended complaint on January 7, 2011, adding Arrow as a defendant. On March 25, 2011, We filed a second amended complaint naming Natco,
Arrow and Watson Laboratories, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Actavis, Inc. (formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which is Arrow's parent) as defendants. Those
three entities remain the current defendants in that action.   

  On
June 12, 2012, we received a Second Notice Letter from Natco, notifying us of Natco's submission in its ANDA of new, additional Paragraph IV certifications against the '517 patent,
the '230 patent and United States Patent Nos. 7,189,740 (the "'740 patent"), 7,855,217 (the "'217 patent") and 7,968,569 (the "'569 patent"). On July 20, 2012, we filed a new
infringement action in the United States District Court of New Jersey against Natco, Arrow, Watson Laboratories, Inc. and Actavis, Inc. in response to the Second Notice Letter with
respect to the '517 patent, the '230 patent, the '740 patent, and the '569 patent, as well as two non-Orange Book listed patents, United States Patent Nos. 7,977,357 (the "'357
patent") and 8,193,219 (the "'219 patent"). Natco filed its Answer and Counterclaims on September 28, 2012. Natco's counterclaims in the second action are similar to its counterclaims in the
first action. In the second action, Natco added counterclaims against United States Patent No. 8,204,763 (the "'763 patent"), which Celgene has not asserted against Natco. Celgene has moved to
dismiss those counterclaims related to the '763 patent for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   

  A
revised Scheduling Order was entered by the Court on November 9, 2012, setting the close for fact discovery on August 14, 2013. A Markman hearing is currently expected to be fully
briefed by the end of July 2013. Dates for a Markman hearing and trial have yet to be set.   

  We
believe that Natco's defenses and counterclaims are unlikely to be sustained and we intend to vigorously defend our patent rights. We believe it unlikely that Natco will prevail on each and every
patent and patent claim subject to the lawsuits, and that all of the patent claims will be deemed to be invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome is not expected
to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   

  However,
if Natco is successful in challenging our patents, and the FDA were to approve Natco's ANDA with a comprehensive education and risk management program for a generic version of lenalidomide
and a generic product were to be introduced, sales of REVLIMID  could be significantly reduced in the United States, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition.   

    ABRAXANE :       On December 14, 2011, Cephalon, Inc. and Acusphere, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging, among   

  145  

Table of Contents   

CELGENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)    

  other
things, that the making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing of ABRAXANE  brand drug infringes claims of United States Patent No. RE40,493. Plaintiffs are seeking damages
and injunctive relief. We intend to vigorously defend against this infringement suit. If the suit against us is successful, we may have to pay damages, ongoing royalties and may have to license rights
from plaintiffs. However, we believe that (a) it is unlikely that the plaintiffs in this matter will prevail and (b) the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.   

    VIDAZA :       On September 28, 2012, we were named as a defendant in a complaint filed by Ivax LLC (formerly Ivax Corporation) in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Ivax LLC alleges that we have infringed the claims of United States Patent No. 7,759,481 by making, using, and selling
VIDAZA  brand drug in the United States. We filed an answer to this complaint on October 19, 2012. We filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on November 15, 2012, to
which Ivax LLC
filed an opposition on December 7, 2012. We intend to vigorously defend against this infringement suit. If the suit against us is successful, we may have to pay damages, ongoing royalties or
license rights from the plaintiff. However, we believe (a) that it is unlikely that the plaintiff in this matter will prevail and (b) that the ultimate outcome will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   

   19.   Geographic and Product Information     

    Operations by Geographic Area:       Revenues primarily consisted of sales of REVLIMID , VIDAZA , ABRAXANE , THALOMID ,
and ISTODAX . Additional sources of revenue included a licensing agreement with Novartis, which entitles us to royalties on FOCALIN XR  and the entire RITALIN 
family of drugs, the sale of services through our Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary and other miscellaneous licensing agreements.   

(1)    Long-lived
assets consist of net property, plant and equipment.

Revenues by Product:       Total revenues from external customers by product for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:   

Major Customers:       We sell our products primarily through wholesale distributors and specialty pharmacies in the United States, which account for a large portion of
our total revenues. International sales are primarily made directly to hospitals, clinics and retail chains, many of which are government owned. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, only Amerisource Bergen
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in at least one of those years and is summarized below. The percentage of amounts due from this customer compared to total net accounts receivable is
also summarized below as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

    CONCLUSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     

  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) (the "Exchange Act"). Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
(including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   

    CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING     

  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   

  149  

Table of Contents    

    MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING     

  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.   

  Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our
transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated
financial statements.   

  Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   

  In
connection with the preparation of our annual consolidated financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework.
Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.   

  Based
on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.   

  KPMG LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued their report on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, a copy of which is included herein.

    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     

  The
Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Celgene Corporation:   

  We
have audited Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.   

  We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

  A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

  Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.   

  We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Celgene Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year

Exhibit 10.19   

Celgene Corporation    Management  Incentive Plan  (MIP)    Plan Year 2012               
     
    Interpretation    
  This 2012 Celgene Management Incentive Plan (the  MIP  or the  Plan ) document, which is voluntarily established by the Company, exclusively applies in respect of the MIP in the Plan Year, which runs from 1 January to 31 December 2012.  This Plan will expire at the end of 2012.  A new plan, if any, may be adopted for each year following 2012 and may contain different terms, including but not limited to different terms as to criteria, weighting and/or levels of Bonus Target, in each case, as determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee.  In the absence of a new plan, no plan will apply and the employees will not be entitled to any bonus or incentive payment during any subsequent year.  Therefore, the Plan does not create any vested rights for any employees to receive any similar payments in the future, even if such payments have been granted repeatedly in the past.  
     
    Purpose    
  The purpose of the Plan is to annually drive the attainment of key quantifiable objectives and reward performance that the Company believes is critical to the success of the Celgene Group.  This Plan also drives the overall success of the Celgene Group by rewarding employees who achieve results through leadership and behaviors that demonstrate the Celgene Values.  
     
    Definitions    
  In this Plan document, the terms are defined as follows:  
     
    Active Employee     refers to an employee whilst in Active Employment.  
     
    Active Employment     means remunerated performance of work duties for Celgene and any Employing Entity and, to avoid doubt, does not include extended-sick leave or disability, family leave or other leaves of absence whether remunerated or otherwise.  
     
    Bonus Target     is the target associated with an employee s position as of 31 December of the Plan Year. Bonus Targets can be expressed as either a percent of Eligible Earnings or as a flat dollar amount.  
     
    Cause     means (a) a material breach of any agreement you have with the Company, including, but not limited to, the Inventions and Confidentiality and Code of Business Conduct; (b) a felony or any other crime involving dishonesty, breach of trust, moral turpitude, or physical harm to any person (including, but not limited to, the Company or any of its employees); (c) an act of fraud, misconduct, or dishonesty in connection with the business of the Company; (d) failure to satisfactorily or adequately perform your duties hereunder as determined by the Company based upon objective facts, including, but not limited to, your inability to achieve goals, inability to work with others, insubordination or excessive tardiness; (e) an overall performance rating of Below Expectations on an annual performance assessment; (f) your receipt of a Final Written Warning for any reason; or (g) insobriety or other substance abuse during work activities.

  1    

Compensation Committee     means the Management Compensation and Development Committee of the Company s Board of Directors.  
     
    Eligible Earnings     means base salary, fixed cash salary and any lump sum merit increases earned while in Active Employment within the Plan Year. The term  Eligible Earnings  will be computed before reduction for pre-tax contributions to any non-qualified deferred compensation plan and/or any employee benefit plan of any member of the Celgene Group pursuant to Sections 401(k) (US only), 125 and 132(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The term  Eligible Earnings   excludes  any variable salary, salary in-kind, performance-related pay and benefits, cost of living payments, one-time lump sum payments and any vacation or holiday pay if not included in fixed cash salary. Overtime (OT) and shift differentials are excluded, unless employee is classified as nonexempt and on US payroll, or unless required by local regulations.  
     
    Employing Entity     means, in respect of each employee, his or her Celgene Group employing entity as listed in Appendix 5.  
     
    Management Committee   is a governing body containing key functional leaders employed by the Company at the VP level and above.  
     
    Individual Performance Score     is the numeric score that represents an individual s performance versus his/her goals. Each goal is scored, and then is multiplied by the weight assigned to that goal. The final scores for all goals (including Celgene Values goals) are added together to determine the Individual Performance Score. Any earned extra credit points are added to the final Individual Performance Score. The Individual Performance Score ranges from 0   150, and with extra credit can reach a maximum of 200.  
     
    Overall Performance Rating     is the letter grade associated with the Individual Performance Score. Overall Performance Rating scores are as follows: S (Superior), EE (Exceeds Expectations), AE (Achieves Expectations), NI (Needs Improvement) and BE (Below Expectations).  This overall performance rating applies to employees in grades 8 through 15 only.  
     
    Plan Year     means 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012.  
     
    Retirement     is defined as an Active Employee s termination of employment (other than for Cause) on or after the attainment of at least age 55 and completion of at least 5 years of service with the Company or any Employing Entity.  
     
    Scope of Role     is a general categorization that pertains to a job s responsibility. Scope of Role and/or an employee s grade level determine how the final bonus amount is calculated using one or more of the following measurements: corporate, divisional, functional, regional, country and individual scores. Scope of Role is further defined in Appendix 1.  
     
    Eligibility    
  Celgene employees in salary grades 8 and above who are not part of any other annual cash incentive plan (i.e., Employee Incentive Plan or Sales Incentive Plan) are eligible to participate in the Plan.  Temporary employees (including interns), Post Doctoral employees, leased employees and independent contractors are excluded from participation in the Plan.  Employment must have commenced on or before September 30th of the Plan Year and an employee must be Actively Employed through December 31st of the Plan Year to participate in the program as specified in  
     
  2    

further detail below.   Employees on an approved leave of absence as of December 31  st   of the Plan Year will receive their award on a prorated basis based on earnings for actual days of employment by such employee during the Plan Year, based upon performance versus objectives and manager approval.  

Situation        

Award Calculation            

New   Hires starting on or before September 30  th       

Award   is prorated using eligible earnings (or a prorated flat bonus amount) based   on the number of days worked in the Plan Year.           

New   Hires starting after September 30  th       

Not   eligible.           

Employee   target decreases during the Plan Year (through transfer to a lower position,   demotion, career ladder placement, etc)       

Generally,   the higher target is maintained until the end of the performance year and   employee assumes lower target on January 1 of the following year. In the   case of demotions, Celgene reserves the right to immediately reduce the Bonus   Target amount or percentage, as applicable.           

Transfer    from  Employee Incentive Plan (EIP).       

Award   is calculated using the Bonus Target as of December 31  st   of the Plan Year. If transfer occurs before   the start of the 4  th   quarter, MIP goals and measurements are to   be established. If transfer occurs during the 4  th   quarter, the EIP goals shall remain and the   EIP score will be used to calculate the bonus for 2012.              

Transfer    to  Employee Incentive Plan (EIP).       

Award   is calculated using the Bonus Target as of December 31  st   of the Plan Year. If transfer occurs before   4  th   quarter, EIP goals and measurements are to   be established. If transfer occurs in the 4  th   quarter, the actual MIP score will be used   to calculate the bonus for 2012.           

Transfer   to or from Sales Incentive Plan position to and from MIP position (as   applicable)       

Award   is prorated for time in each plan. Proration is to the nearest quarter, per   the Sales Incentive Plan. Regardless of proration, there will be no overlap   of plan eligibility. Example: If employee transfers from SIP to MIP on   June 15, he/she will be paid out 2 quarters on SIP and 2 quarters on   MIP. SIP payout is from Jan 1 through June 30 and MIP payout is from   July 1 through Dec 31.           

Involuntary   termination during the Plan Year (up to and including work through   December 31  st  ) for reasons    other  than for Cause       

Award   is prorated based on the number of days worked during the Plan Year and is   typically paid at target at time of termination, and is contingent upon   agreeing to the terms of a Separation Agreement, if applicable. Celgene   Management, in its sole discretion, may award payments at, above or below   target based on latest estimates of company and/or individual performance.           

Involuntary   termination after December 31 of the Plan Year for reasons other than   cause or gross misconduct, but prior to when 2012 MIP payments are made.       

Employee   is eligible for a MIP award for the  completed  2012 Plan Year; payment   is calculated using actual individual and company performance and is paid   according to schedule established for active employees. This means that   performance document must be completed and approved for employee (including   ratings and scores for each goal).   
     
  Employee   is also eligible for a prorated 2013 MIP award based on the number of days   worked during the Plan Year and is typically paid at target at the time of   termination (see Involuntary termination during the Plan Year section).   Celgene Management, in its sole discretion, may award payments at, above or   below target based on latest estimates of Celgene performance.           

Voluntary   termination after December 31 of the Plan Year, but prior to when MIP   payments are made       

Employee   is eligible for MIP award. Payment is calculated using actual individual and   company performance and is paid according to schedule established for active   employees.           

Retirement       

Award   is prorated based on the number of days worked during the Plan Year and is   typically paid at target at time of retirement. Celgene Management may award   payments at, above or below target based on latest estimates of company   performance. Employee must meet eligibility age of at least 55 years and must   have completed 5 or more years of service.           

Death   in Service       

Award   is prorated based on the number of days worked during              
     
  3    

the   Plan Year and is typically paid at target to the estate at time of death.   Celgene Management may award payments at, above or below target based on   latest estimates of company performance.           

Leaves   of Absence and Disability       

Award   is prorated based on the number of days of Active Employment. Bonus is paid   in accordance with schedule defined for active employees. Special   rules may apply in different countries.           

Transfers   to or from countries with different currencies       

Award   is paid in currency in which employee is paid as of December 31  st   of the Plan Year. Exchange rates as of   December 31  st   are used.              
     
    Establishment of Performance Objectives    
  Plan participants  2012 goals are established, measured, assessed and scored against one or more of the following: corporate, divisional, functional, regional, country and individual objectives. The Plan is designed to reward employees with a cash bonus based upon the achievement of key performance and values objectives (values objectives apply to grades 8 through 15 only) established at or around the start of the Plan Year.  
     
  Objectives used to measure performance are those that ultimately drive the achievement of our financial and business performance and are established per the following:  
     
                          Individual objectives:    Set as part of the performance management process and are approved by Celgene Management  
                          Divisional, functional, regional and country objectives   : Set by Celgene Management and approved by the Chief Executive Officer  
                          Corporate objectives   : Set by Celgene Management under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and are subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee  
     
    Plan Features    
     
    Determining the Bonus Target    
  Each position is assigned a Bonus Target defined as a percentage of Eligible Earnings or as a flat target amount.  An employee s Bonus Target calculation is based on his or her Eligible Earnings within the Plan Year multiplied by the Bonus Target percentage, or is just the flat target amount (prorated based on the number of days employed by Celgene or any Employing Entity during the Plan Year).  
     
    Determining Bonus Target Weights    
  For all Plan participants in grades 8 through 15, the Bonus Target is weighted as a mix of individual, divisional, functional, regional,   Sub-Regional Commercial ,  country and corporate goals.  For plan participants at VP level and above, the Bonus Target may be a mix of individual , divisional, regional, Sub-Regional Commercial ,country and corporate or all corporate goals.  These weightings reflect the principle that the greater impact the employee may potentially have on achieving certain objectives, the greater the weighting placed on those objectives. The chart in Appendix 2 outlines the various Bonus Target weightings by scope of role and/or grade.  
     
  4    

Determining the Bonus Payout    
  Bonus payouts may be higher or lower than an employee s bonus target and are determined as follows:  

Employees in Grades .        

Bonus Determined by             

8   through 15       

Combination   of individual and business performance and values scores           

VP   and Above       

Individual   and/or business performance scores              
     
  If business achievements are above 100%, this will translate into MIP payouts greater than target.  Scores and achievements that are below 100% will result in payouts lower than target.  
     
  The maximum gross amount of the total bonus payout for this Plan Year is 200% of Bonus Target.  Refer to the  Award Payment  section of this document for examples.  
     
    Setting Individual   Values Objectives    
  Annual individual objectives are established as part of the Performance Management Process. It is recommended that the number of individual objectives for an employee be between five and seven.  This will ensure that objectives are weighted appropriately for impact and achievement, yet allow the employee to maintain a continuous focus on each objective and the individual activities that contribute to the achievement of these objectives. The individual objectives will typically be derived from annual business plans and may incorporate both financial and non-financial goals.  
     
  Individual objectives should be developed based on Aligned Specific Measurable Attainable Realistic Time-based (ASMART) principles and reflect desired performance results.  Activities or tasks are not considered bonus-eligible  objectives.   All participants should ensure that their MIP objectives are  impact  and  results  focused against key, critical deliverables.  
     
  In addition to setting individual performance objectives, employees in grades 8 through 15 should set at least three goals regarding at least three of the four Celgene Values. Each of these goals will be equally weighted and in totality will comprise 25% of the Individual Performance Score.  
     
  Individual   Values objectives must be reviewed and approved by each employee s manager and his/her manager and should be reviewed at mid-year.  At this point in the year, the manager and/or his/her manager may make modifications to individual objectives to reflect changes in the business or its operating environment.  Changes in participant objectives that have a significant impact upon the corporate objectives, however, may only be made during the Plan Year with approval from a Management Committee member.  
     
    Determining the Corporate MIP Score    
  Based upon recommendation from the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee will, in its sole discretion, determine the degree of attainment of corporate objectives by participants for the Plan Year.  
     
  5    

Determining the Individual Performance Score    
  The ability of each participant to focus on the achievement of the corporate, divisional, regional, country, and individual objectives is critical to Celgene achieving its key milestones. In addition,  how   each employee in grades 8 through 15 achieves his/her individual objectives vis- -vis the Celgene Values is critically important to creating and maintaining a culture that fosters strong performance and high achievement. Therefore, there are two key components that determine the Overall Performance Rating. They are:  
     
    Performance Goals Score (75% of Individual Performance Score for grades 8 through 15; 100% of Individual Score for VPs and above)    :  Represents each employee s performance versus objectives that are set as part of the performance management process. Each objective is weighted and evaluated individually and each employee and his/her manager are required to carry out a final assessment of each score. Each objective score is then added together to determine the final Performance Goals Score. For weighting of corporate, regional, sub-regional, country or individual goals, refer to Appendix 2.  
     
    Values Goals      Score ( 25% of Individual Performance Score for grades 8 through 15):     Represents each employee s performance versus goals regarding the Celgene Values. Each goal will be equally weighted and are set as part of the performance management process. Each objective is evaluated individually and each employee and his/her manager are required to carry out a final assessment of each score. Each objective score is then added together to determine the final Values Goals Score. If an employee receives an overall Values Rating of Below Expectations (BE) the Overall Peformance Rating will likewise be BE, resulting in an Overall Performance Score (i.e., MIP score) of zero and no bonus will be paid.  
     
    Extra Credit     :    Each manager   at his/her own discretion   may award  up to a total of  50 points of extra credit to an employee who demonstrates results that far surpass the established achievement measurements for a goal. Extra credit is awarded per individual goal and may only be given when the following conditions are met:  
     
                         The provision for extra credit (including measures and criteria for awarding) must have been included in the goal at the time it was approved  
                         Criteria and results for extra credit must be thoroughly documented in the performance review  
     
  The intention of extra credit is to further reward exceptional performance that brings significant value to Celgene and drives its business forward and as such should be utilized on an exception or infrequent basis.

  The following table indicates the date upon which the Optionee shall be entitled to exercise the indicated installments of this Option (the  Vesting Date ), and the number of shares of Common Stock thereupon issuable upon such exercise, provided that the Optionee has not incurred a Termination of Employment prior to the applicable Vesting Date:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, 100% of the then unvested Options shall become fully vested and exercisable on the date of the Optionee s death or Disability, provided that the Optionee has not incurred a Termination of Employment prior to the applicable date. In addition, 100% of the then unvested Options shall become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with Section 13.1 (c) of the Plan in the event of Optionee s involuntary Termination of Employment without Cause at any time during the two (2) year period commencing on a Change in Control.  
     
  There shall be no proportionate or partial vesting in the periods prior to each Vesting Date, and all such vesting shall occur only on the Vesting Date.  
     
   Exercise Prior to Vesting Permitted.   
     
  Subject to the provisions of this Option, the Optionee may elect at any time prior to the Optionee s Termination of Employment to exercise this Option as to any part or all of the shares of Common Stock subject to this Option at any time during the term hereof prior to the Vesting Date set forth above with respect to the Option; provided, however that:  
     
  (1)  any shares so purchased under an Option which have not vested as of the date of exercise shall be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company, as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement annexed hereto as Exhibit B ( Restricted Stock Agreement ), which will lapse in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth above, and such other terms and provisions in the Restricted Stock Agreement; and  
     
  (2)  the Optionee enters into a Restricted Stock Agreement.

   Conflicting Employment Agreement.     In the event the Optionee has entered into an individual employment agreement with the Employer, to the extent that this Agreement conflicts, or is inconsistent, with the conditions and provisions of each individual employment agreement (provided, however, that such employment agreement does not conflict with the terms of the Plan), such individual employment agreement shall control to the extent more favorable to the Optionee than the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be modified accordingly.  
     
   No Obligation to Continue Employment.     This Agreement does not guarantee that the Employer will employ the Optionee for any specific time period, nor does it modify in any respect the Employer s right to terminate or modify the Optionee s employment or compensation.  
     
   Termination by Reason of Retirement.     This Option is eligible for continued vesting during the three year period (but not beyond the term of the Option) following a participant s Retirement under Section 12.2(b) of the Plan.

As a condition to the settlement of the Award, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation.  
     
  The shares of Common Stock are being issued to the Participant and this Agreement is being made by the Company in reliance upon the following express representations and warranties of the Participant.  The participant acknowledges, represents and warrants that:  
     
  (a)               He or she has been advised that he or she may be an  affiliate  within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Act  ) and in this connection the Company is relying in part on his or her representations set forth in this section.  
     
  (b)               If he or she is deemed an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Act, the Shares must be held indefinitely unless an exemption from any applicable resale restrictions is available or the Company files an additional registration statement (or a  re-offer prospectus ) with regard to such shares of Common Stock and the Company is under no obligation to register the shares (or to file a  re-offer prospectus ).  
     
  (c)               If he or she is deemed an affiliate within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Act, he or she understands that the exemption from registration under Rule 144 will not be available   
     
  3    

unless (i) a public trading market then exists for the Common Stock of the Company, (ii) adequate information concerning the Company is then available to the public, and (iii) other terms and conditions of Rule 144 or any exemption therefrom are complied with; and that any sales of the shares of Common Stock may be made only in limited amounts in accordance with such terms and conditions.  
     
  10.                Legend    .    The Company may at any time place legends referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions on all certificates representing shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement.  The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to this Agreement in the possession of the Participant in order to carry out the provisions of this Section 10.  
     
  11.                Not an Agreement of Employment    .  Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the grant of the Award constitute an agreement by the Company to engage or continue to engage the Participant as an employee of the Company for any period.  
     
  12.                Transfer of Personal Data    .  The Participant authorizes, agrees and unambiguously consents to the transmission by the Company of any personal data information related to the Award, for legitimate business purposes (including, without limitation, the administration of the Plan) out of the Participant s home country and including to countries with less data protection than the data protection provided by the Participant s home country.  This authorization/consent is freely given by the Participant.  
     
  13.                Withholding Taxes    .  Prior to the delivery of shares of Common Stock to the Participant under this Agreement, the Company shall deduct any Federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable. Any fraction of Shares required to satisfy such tax obligations shall also be reduced.  
     
  14.                Section 409A    .    Although the Company does not guarantee the tax treatment of any payments under this Agreement, the intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement be exempt from, or comply with Code Section 409A and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the foregoing.  In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on the Participant as a result of Code Section 409A or any damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.  All amounts payable hereunder intend to satisfy the short-term deferral exception in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(4) and are therefore not subject to Code Section 409A.  Whenever a payment under this Agreement may be paid within a specified period, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the Company s sole discretion.  
     
  15.                Miscellaneous    .  
  (a)               This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal legal representatives, successors, trustees, administrators, distributees, devisees and legatees.  The Company may assign this Agreement to any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), provided that any successor   
     
  4    

assumes the Company s obligations under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may not assign this Agreement.  
     
  (b)               This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including via facsimile, each of which shall constitute an original copy, and all of which taken together shall constitute one contract.  
     
  (c)               The failure of any party hereto at any time to require performance by another party of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the right of such party to require performance of that provision, and any waiver by any party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right under this Agreement.  
     
  (d)               The headings of the Sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.  
     
  (e)               This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed and the legal relationships of the parties determined in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without reference to rules relating to conflicts of law.  
     
    NO ACQUIRED RIGHTS    .  
     
  THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (A) THE COMPANY MAY TERMINATE OR AMEND THE PLAN AT ANY TIME; (B) THE AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS MADE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF ANY OTHER AWARD OR GRANT AND IS MADE AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY; AND (C) NO PAST GRANTS OR AWARDS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AWARDED HEREUNDER) GIVE THE PARTICIPANT ANY RIGHT TO ANY GRANTS OR AWARDS IN THE FUTURE WHATSOEVER.

  2.     Based

the registrant and have:   

a)     Designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating

  b)    Designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance

of the registrant's Board of Directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)     All
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

  b)    Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
