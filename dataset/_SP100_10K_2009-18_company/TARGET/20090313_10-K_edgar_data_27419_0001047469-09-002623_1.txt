PART I        

Item 1.    Business            

General   

          Target Corporation (the Corporation or Target) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1902. We operate as two reportable segments: Retail and
Credit Card.   

          Our
Retail Segment includes all of our merchandising operations, including our large-format general merchandise and food discount stores in the United States and our fully integrated
online business. We offer both everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated merchandise at exceptional prices. Our ability to deliver a shopping experience that is preferred by our guests is
supported by our strong supply chain and technology infrastructure, a devotion to innovation that is ingrained in our organization and culture, and our disciplined approach to managing our current
business and investing in future growth. As a component of the Retail Segment, our online business strategy is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly either online or by locating
them in one of our stores with the aid of on-line research and location tools. Our online shopping site offers similar merchandise categories to those found in our stores, excluding food
items and household commodities.   

          Our
Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and the Target Card (collectively, REDcards). Our Credit Card
Segment strengthens the bond with our guests, drives incremental sales and contributes to our results of operations.   

          Prior
to 2008, we operated as a single business segment. Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.   

Financial Highlights   

          Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to
fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended January 31, 2009 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended February 2, 2008 and consisted
of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 (2006) ended February 3, 2007 and consisted of 53 weeks.   

For
information on key financial highlights, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

Seasonality   

          Due to the seasonal nature of our business, a substantially larger share of total annual revenues and earnings traditionally occurs in
the fourth quarter because it includes the peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December.   

Merchandise   

          We operate Target general merchandise stores with a wide assortment of general merchandise and a limited assortment of food items, as
well as SuperTarget stores with a full line of food and general merchandise items. Target.com offers a wide assortment of general merchandise including many items found in our stores and a
complementary assortment, such as extended sizes and colors, sold only online. A significant portion of our sales is from national brand merchandise. In addition, we sell merchandise under
private-label brands including, but not limited to, Archer Farms , Boots   Barkley , Choxie , Circo , Durabuilt ,
Embark , Garden Place , Gilligan   O'Malley , itso , Kaori , Market Pantry , Merona ,
Playwonder , Room Essentials , Sutton and Dodge , Target Brand, Target Home, Trutech , Vroom , Wine Cube , and
Xhilaration . We also sell merchandise through unique programs such as ClearRx SM , GO International , and Home Design Event. In addition, we sell merchandise under
licensed brands including, but not limited to, C9 by Champion, Chefmate, Cherokee, Converse One Star, Eddie Bauer, Fieldcrest, Genuine Kids by Osh Kosh, Kitchen Essentials by Calphalon, Liz Lange for
Target, Michael Graves Design, Mossimo, Nick   Nora, Perfect Pieces by Victoria Hagan, Sean Conway, Simply Shabby Chic, Smith   Hawken, Sonia Kashuk, Thomas O'Brien,

Waverly
and Woolrich. We also generate revenue from in-store amenities such as Food Avenue , Target Clinic , Target Pharmacy SM , and Target
Photo SM , and from leased or licensed departments such as Optical, Pizza Hut, Portrait Studio and Starbucks.   

Distribution   

          The vast majority of our merchandise is distributed through our network of distribution centers. We operated 34 distribution centers at
January 31, 2009. General merchandise is shipped to and from our distribution centers by common carriers. Certain food items are distributed by third parties. Merchandise sold through
Target.com is distributed through our own distribution network, through third parties, or shipped directly from vendors.   

Employees   

          At January 31, 2009, we employed approximately 351,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees,
referred to as "team members." During our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December, our employment levels peaked at approximately 400,000 team members. We consider our team member
relations to be good. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our team members. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies, depending on team members'
full-time or part-time status, compensation level, date of hire and/or length of service. These company-paid benefits include a pension plan, 401(k) plan, medical
and dental plans, a retiree medical plan, short-term and long-term disability insurance, paid vacation, tuition reimbursement, various team member assistance programs, life
insurance and merchandise discounts.   

Working Capital   

          Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period
from Thanksgiving to the end of December. The increase in working capital during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and short-term borrowings.   

          Additional
details are provided in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Competition   

          In our Retail Segment, we compete with traditional and off-price general merchandise retailers, apparel retailers, Internet
retailers, wholesale clubs, category specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce. Our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely determines
our competitive position within the retail industry.   

          In
our Credit Card Segment, our primary mission is to deliver financial products and services that drive sales and deepen guest relationships at Target. Our financial products compete
with those of other issuers for market share of sales volume. Our ability to differentiate the value of our financial products primarily through our rewards programs, terms, credit line management,
and guest service determines our competitive position.   

Intellectual Property   

          Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, SuperTarget and our
"Bullseye Design," have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors            

          Our business is subject to a variety of risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our
guests and a brand they trust. Meeting our guests' expectations requires us to manage various operational and financial risks. Set forth below are the most significant risks that we face.   

    Our success depends on our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers.     

          The retail business is highly competitive. In the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping
experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, guest service and marketing efforts. Guest perceptions regarding the
cleanliness and safety of our stores and our in-stock levels are also factors in our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of
these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margin and expenses. If we fail to continue to positively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could
be adversely affected.   

    If we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margin and profitability could suffer.     

A substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend-right decisions in apparel, home d cor,
seasonal offerings and other merchandise. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to lost sales,
increased markdowns on inventory and adversely affect our results of operations.   

    All of our stores are located within the United States, making us highly susceptible to deteriorations in U.S. macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence.     

          All of our stores are located within the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health
of the U.S. economy. In addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Illinois, resulting in further
dependence on local economic conditions in these states. The success of our credit card business is also highly dependent on consumers' willingness to use credit cards over other payment methods,
their ability to pay and our ability to anticipate changes to the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could
negatively impact our business in many ways, including:   

Slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales.           Reducing gross margins.           Increasing our expenses, including bad debt expense.

Table of Contents   

If we do not continually attract, train and retain qualified employees, our results of operations could be adversely affected.     

          Our business is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members. Many of
those team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external
factors such as unemployment levels, health care costs and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, guest service
levels and support functions could suffer, and we could experience delays in opening new stores. Those factors, together with increased wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of
operations.   

    Inability to build new stores in suitable locations could slow our growth, and difficulty in building new stores could increase our costs and capital requirements.     

          Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build new stores and expand existing stores in a manner that achieves
appropriate returns on our capital investment. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. In addition, for many sites we are dependent on a third party
developer's ability to acquire land, obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project, of which our store may be one component. Turmoil in the financial
markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact
our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing and expanding our stores. A significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned to occur
within fully developed markets, which is generally a more time-consuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets. Delays in new
store openings could have an adverse effect on our sales growth, and increased costs associated with new stores and store expansions could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Interruptions in our supply chain could adversely affect our results.     

          We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its
commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales. In addition, a large portion of our merchandise is
sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, the
outbreak of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security or other events that could slow port activities and impact foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our
supply of merchandise and adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.     

          If our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children's products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests'
expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety
laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food
or drug contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative guest perceptions
regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us
to regain the confidence of our guests.   

    If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our
reputation could suffer.     

          The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests. If we experience a data security
breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could
cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products, decline to use our pharmacy   

  5  

Table of Contents   

services,
or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks.     

          Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our
workforce (none of which is represented by unions as of the end of 2008) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes impacting our
relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed,
minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, certain aspects of our business, such as our pharmacy and credit card operations, are more heavily regulated than other areas. Changes
in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit, Medicare reimbursements, privacy and information security, product safety or environmental protection, among others,
could cause our expenses to increase. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, particularly wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government
enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Given the geographic concentration of our stores, natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations.     

          Our three largest states, by total sales, are California, Texas and Florida, areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent. Such
events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our
distribution centers and stores, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   

Changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations.     

          Our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors, including statutory tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets
and liabilities, and, due to the method by which we economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities, changes in capital market returns. Changes in the tax laws, the interpretation of existing
laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate bears an inverse relationship to
capital market returns due principally to our use of company-owned life insurance as an investment vehicle to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities.   

If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our growth plans, liquidity and results of operations could suffer.     

          We are dependent on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans. In
particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures, the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to
fund seasonal needs for working capital, and the asset-backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio. In addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our
exposure to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements,
fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures.

Item 2.    Properties            

          At January 31, 2009, we had 1,682 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia:   

The following table summarizes the number of owned or leased stores and distribution centers at January 31, 2009:

          We
are a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by the California Attorney General in October 2008 alleging that we sold certain products that contained volatile organic compounds in excess
of regulated limits (windshield washer fluid and air fresheners) and other products that were not approved for sale in
California (gas cans and gas generators). The case is in its early stages and settlement discussions are continuing. We anticipate that any resolution of this matter is likely to exceed $100,000 but
will not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we are one of many defendants in a lawsuit filed on February 13, 2008, by the State of
California involving environmental matters that may involve potential monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000. The allegation, initially made by the California Air Resources Board in April 2006,
involves a non-food product (hairspray) that allegedly contained levels of a volatile organic compound in excess of permissible levels. We anticipate that the settlement, to be fully
indemnified by the vendor, is likely to exceed $100,000 but will not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   

          The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 requires SEC registrants to disclose if they have been required to pay certain penalties for failing to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service

PART II        

Item 5.    Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities            

          Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TGT." We are authorized to issue up to
6,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0833, and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01. At March 11, 2009, there were 18,007 shareholders of record. Dividends
declared per share and the high and low closing common stock price for each fiscal quarter during 2008 and 2007 are disclosed in Note 29 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   

          In
November 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $10 billion of our common stock. Since the inception of this share repurchase program, we have repurchased
93.7 million common shares for a total cash investment of $4,840 million ($51.66 per share). In November 2008 we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily
suspending our open-market share repurchase program.   

          The
table below presents information with respect to Target common stock purchases made during the three months ended January 31, 2009, by Target or any "affiliated purchaser" of
Target, as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act.   

The table above includes common stock shares reacquired from team members who wish to tender
owned shares to satisfy the tax withholding on equity awards as part of our long-term incentive plans or to satisfy the exercise price on stock option exercises. In the fourth quarter of
2008, 17,037 shares were acquired at an average per share price of $35.34 pursuant to our long-term incentive plans.   

The table above includes shares reacquired upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. For the
three months ended January 31, 2009, 0.4 million shares were reacquired through these contracts. At January 31, 2009, we held asset positions in prepaid forward contracts for
2.2 million shares of our common stock, for a total cash investment of $88 million, or an average per share price of $39.98. Refer to Notes 24 and 26 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further details of these contracts.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations            

Executive Summary     

          Our financial results for both the fourth quarter and 2008 fiscal year reflect the impact of adverse economic conditions on our
business segments. Our Retail Segment results were affected by changes in consumer spending patterns that negatively impacted our traffic and sales, particularly in higher margin discretionary
categories, creating an elevated level of markdowns resulting from weaker than expected sales. Our Credit Card Segment performance, like that of other credit card issuers, was adversely affected by
the deteriorating credit and risk environment. As a result, we incurred higher-than-expected bad debt expense as we both wrote-off accounts and added significantly
to our allowance for doubtful accounts. In light of this challenging retail and credit environment, we have suspended our share repurchase program and reduced spending on new store construction and
remodels.   

          Sales
totaled $62,884 million in 2008, $61,471 million in 2007 and $57,878 million in 2006, increasing 2.3 percent in 2008 and 6.2 percent in 2007.
Comparable-store sales (as defined below) in 2008 declined 2.9 percent from 2007; comparable-store sales in 2007 grew 3.0 percent from 2006. Credit card revenues were
$2,064 million, $1,896 million and $1,612 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, increasing 8.9 percent in 2008 and 17.6 percent in 2007. The combination of
retail and credit card operations produced earnings before interest expense and income taxes of $4,402 million in 2008, $5,272 million in 2007 and $5,069 million in 2006,
decreasing 16.5 percent in 2008 and increasing 4.0 percent in 2007. Cash flow provided by operations was $4,430 million, $4,125 million and $4,862 million for 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, we paid dividends of $465 million in 2008, $442 million in 2007 and $380 million in 2006. We opened 114 new stores in 2008, or 91 stores
net of 21 relocations and two closings. In 2007, we opened 118 new stores representing 103 stores net of 14 relocations and one closing.   

          Management's
Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   

Analysis of Results of Operations     

    Retail Segment     

EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization.   

      EBIT is earnings before interest expense and income taxes.   

(a)      New account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales. Our Retail Segment charges these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the
reimbursements of $117 million in 2008, $114 million in 2007 and $109 million in 2006, are recorded as a reduction to SG A expenses within the Retail
Segment.    

Retail Segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by
sales.

    Sales     

          Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer
to Note 2 for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for the 2008 year were $62,884 million, compared with $61,471 million in 2007 and
$57,878 million in 2006. The 2008 and 2007 periods were
52-week years compared to the 2006 period that was a 53-week year. Growth in total sales between 2008 and 2007 resulted from sales from stores opened in 2008, offset by lower
comparable-store sales. The increase in total sales between 2007 and 2006 is attributable to both new stores and comparable-store sales increases. In 2008, inflation affected sales growth by
approximately 2 percentage points, compared with a deflationary impact of 2 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2006.   

Comparable-store sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a
period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store
sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, beginning in 2007, we changed our comparable-store sales calculation to include
sales from our online business because we believe this combined measure represents a more useful disclosure in light of our fully integrated, multi-channel approach to our business.   

Comparable-store
sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and SuperTarget stores open longer than one year, including:   

sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open           sales from stores that have been relocated to new
buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the
new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes    

Comparable-store
sales do not include:   

sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget
store format           sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed    

The comparable-store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing
sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length.   

          In 2008, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, slightly offset by an increase in average
transaction amount, which reflects the effect of a higher selling price per unit sold partially offset by a decrease in number of units per transaction. In fiscal 2007, the comparable store sales
increase was driven primarily by an increase in average transaction amount when compared to 2006, with both the number of units and selling price per unit sold, each representing roughly half of the
increase attributable to average transaction amount. Transaction-level metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, and comparable-store sales
rates is negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores.

    Gross Margin Rate     

          Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a description of
expenses included in cost of sales. Markup is the difference between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor
offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous
price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions.   

In
2008, our consolidated gross margin rate was 29.8 percent compared with 30.2 percent in 2007. Our 2008 gross margin rate was adversely affected by sales mix, which
resulted in a 0.6 percentage point reduction in the gross margin rate. Sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates (generally non-discretionary product
categories of consumables and commodities) outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories. This mix impact was partially offset by favorable supply chain expense rates, as
well as higher gross margin rates within merchandise categories across our assortment, which had a combined favorable impact on gross margin rate of approximately 0.2 percentage point.   

In
2007, our consolidated gross margin rate was consistent with the 2006 gross margin rate. Our gross margin rate for 2007 benefited from higher margin rates within merchandise
categories. Substantially all of this benefit was offset by the adverse effects from sales of lower margin merchandise categories outpacing sales of higher margin merchandise categories. During 2007,
rate improvement within categories was driven generally by an array of inventory control initiatives that minimized markdowns.   

    Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate     

          Our selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense rate represents SG A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 for a
description of expenses included in SG A expenses. SG A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit card operations, which are reflected separately
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

          SG A
expense rate was 20.4 percent in 2008, which was the same as 2007 and consistent with 20.3 percent in 2006. Within SG A expenses in 2008 and 2007, there were no
expense categories that experienced a significant fluctuation as a percentage of sales, when compared to prior periods. These expense rates reflect sustained productivity gains in our stores and
disciplined expense control across the Corporation.   

Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate     

          Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2008, our
depreciation and amortization expense rate was 2.9 percent compared with 2.7 percent in 2007 and 2.6 percent in 2006. The comparative increases in 2008 and 2007 were due to
increased capital expenditures, specifically related to investments in new stores. During 2006, we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms
for individual leases, resulting in a cumulative benefit to depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $28 million.   

    Store Data     

(a)       Includes 21 store relocations in the same trade area and    2    stores closed without replacement.      (b)
      Reflects total square feet less office, distribution center and vacant space.

    Credit Card Segment     

          Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenues, and third party merchant fees, or the amounts
received from merchants who accept the Target Visa credit card.   

(a)       New account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales. Our Retail Segment charges these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the reimbursements of
$117 million in 2008, $114 million in 2007 and $109 million in 2006, are recorded as an increase to Operations and Marketing expenses within the Credit Card
Segment.      (b)      Amounts represent the portion of average credit card receivables funded by Target. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, these amounts exclude $4,503 million,
$2,387 million and $1,782 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables.      (c)      ROIC is return on invested
capital, and this rate equals our segment profit divided by average receivables funded by Target, expressed as an annualized
rate.      (d)      As an annualized percentage of average receivables.      

(a)       Balance-weighted one-month LIBOR        (b)       As a percentage of average receivables        (c)       Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the vast majority of our portfolio earns finance charge revenue at rates tied to
the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.    

          Our primary measure of profitability in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the
interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital Target has invested in our credit card receivables.
In addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates the credit
performance and overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing
cost applied to the entire portfolio. The vast majority of our portfolio accrues finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by
credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.   

          Segment
profit and dollar spread to LIBOR measures in 2008 were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense. Segment revenues were $2,064 million,
an increase of $168 million, or 8.9 percent, from the prior year, driven by a 19.5 percent increase in average receivables. On a rate basis,   

  15  

Table of Contents   

  revenue
yield decreased 2.4 percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the Prime Rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume
contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees. This negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in 2008 that increased our
effective yield. Segment expenses were $1,742 million, an increase of $776 million, or 80.3 percent, from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of
$770 million. The increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net write-off rate from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 9.3 percent in 2008 and the
increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $440 million for anticipated future write-offs of current receivables. Segment profit decreased from 16.3 percent in 2007
to 3.7 percent in 2008 primarily due to the effect of bad debt expense, the reduction in receivables owned and funded by Target, and the impact of a lower Prime Rate during 2008.   

          2007
segment revenues were $1,896 million, an increase of $284 million, or 17.6 percent, from the prior year, driven by a higher average receivables balance. The
annualized rates for the components of segment revenue were consistent with prior periods. Segment expenses were $966 million, an increase of $136 million, or 16.4 percent, from
2006. This increase was due to bad debt expense in 2007 which rose reflecting an increase in net write-offs and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of higher
expected future losses on period-end receivables. Segment ROIC benefited from a slightly higher percentage of third party funding of our credit card receivables.   

          We
implemented a terms change to our portfolio, effective in April 2009, that establishes a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to a receivables balance as a finance charge.
Under this terms change, finance charges will accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than a threshold amount; if the Prime Rate is greater than the threshold, finance charges will
accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread.   

(a)       Net write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges) less current period principal recoveries.    

          Our 2008 period-end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of
5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008 increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary
Target Cards to higher-limit Target Visa cards and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card
usage by our guests, and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk guests.   

  16  

Table of Contents    

          2007 period-end receivables were $8,624 million compared with $6,711 million in 2006, an increase of 28.5 percent. Average
receivables in 2007 increased 18.1 percent to $7,275 million from $6,161 million. This growth in receivables measure was driven primarily by a product change from proprietary
Target Cards to Target Visa cards for a group of higher credit-quality Target Card Guests. A product change to a Target Visa card generally results in a higher receivables balance because it can be
used for purchases outside of Target stores and has a higher credit limit. Accounts converted from a Target Card to a Target Visa accounted for approximately 20 percentage points of the growth
in period-end receivables. The remainder of our year-over-year receivables growth was primarily due to a reduction in payment rates on non-converted
accounts.   

Other Performance Factors     

    Net Interest Expense     

          Net interest expense was $866 million at the end of 2008, increasing 33.8 percent, or $219 million from 2007. This
increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment, share repurchase and the receivables portfolio, partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest
rate. In 2007, net interest expense was $647 million compared with $572 million in 2006, an increase of 13.2 percent. This increase related to higher average debt balances,
including the debt to fund growth in accounts receivable. The average portfolio interest rate was 5.3 percent in 2008, 6.1 percent in 2007 and 6.2 percent in 2006.   

    Provision for Income Taxes     

          Our effective income tax rate was 37.4 percent in 2008, 38.4 percent in 2007 and 38.0 percent in 2006. The
decrease in 2008 was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate is also lower due to a
comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to
economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable. The increase in the 2007 effective rate from the prior year was primarily
due to lower capital market returns on these investments as compared to 2006.   

    Workforce Reduction     

          In 2008, we recorded a $47 million charge related to workforce reduction actions, approximately $21 million of which
related to actions announced in January 2009 affecting our headquarters population. This charge was comprised of severance and benefit costs of $37 million and other expenses, primarily early
lease exit costs, of $10 million. At the end of 2008, the remaining liability balance relating to severance costs was approximately $31 million. We believe that the liability will be
substantially extinguished by the end of the first quarter of 2009. The liability is recorded as a component of other current liabilities and the expenses are recorded as a component of SG A.   

          We
will incur costs in 2009 for workforce reduction actions announced in 2008 but where team members are required to provide future services. We estimate those costs will be
approximately $11 million and generally represent severance and benefits costs to be paid during 2009.   

Analysis of Financial Condition   

    Liquidity and Capital Resources     

          We continue to fund our operations and growth through a combination of internally generated funds and debt financing. Cash flow
provided by operations was $4,430 million in 2008 compared with $4,125 million in 2007.   

          Our
2008 period-end gross receivables were $9,094 million compared with $8,624 million in 2007, an increase of 5.4 percent. Average receivables in 2008
increased 19.5 percent compared with 2007 levels. This growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year's product change from proprietary Target Cards to higher-limit Target Visa cards
and the impact of industry-wide declines in payment rates, offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly   

  17  

Table of Contents   

  reduced
credit lines and from notable reductions in card usage. As further described in Note 10, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to a JPMorgan Chase affiliate (JPMC). The
interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the transaction.   

Year-end
inventory levels decreased $75 million, or 1.1 percent from 2007, reflecting inventory management initiatives responding to declining consumer demand
offset by increased inventory levels required to support comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable decreased by 5.7 percent over the same period.   

          During
2008, we repurchased 67.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $3,395 million ($50.49 per share) under a $10 billion share
repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2007 we repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,642 million
($57.24 per share). In November 2008 we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open-market share repurchase program.   

          We
declared dividends totaling $471 million ($0.62 per share) in 2008, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2007. In 2007 we declared dividends totaling $454 million
($0.54 per share), an increase of 14.6 percent over 2006. We have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our
intent to continue to do so in the future.   

          Our
financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt
maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs.   

          Maintaining
strong investment-grade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy. Our current debt ratings are as follows:

n/a  

(a)       These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC.      

          At January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We fund our peak
sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and typically use the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. Additionally and as described
in Note 10, we sold to JPMC an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately $3.8 billion. We received proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion, reflecting a
7 percent discount.   

          An
additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in April 2007, which will
expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2008 or 2007 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities.   

          Most
of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a
debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 31, 2009, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration
of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a
change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are
placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.   

          Our
interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of
rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SEC's applicable rules was 4.3x in 2008, 6.4x in 2007 and 7.1x in 2006.   

    Capital Expenditures     

          Capital expenditures were $3,547 million in 2008, compared with $4,369 million in 2007 and $3,928 million in 2006.
This decrease was driven by lower capital expenditures for new stores, remodels and technology-related assets. Our 2008 capital expenditures include $1,258 million related to stores that will

in 2009 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $1,661 million in 2008 following an increase of $2,664 million in 2007.   

Commitments and Contingencies     

          At January 31, 2009, our contractual obligations were as follows:   

(a)       Required principal payments only. Excludes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," fair market
value adjustments recorded in long-term debt. Principal amounts include the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC at the principal
amount.      (b)      These payments vary with LIBOR and are calculated assuming LIBOR of 0.5 percent plus a spread, for each year outstanding.        (c)       Total contractual lease payments include $1,830 million of lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also
includes $164 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2009 or later. Refer to Note 21 for a further description of leases.        (d)      
Estimated tax contingencies of $447 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates
of the period of cash settlement.    

          Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Purchase obligations
include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license
commitments and service contracts.   

          We
issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to
be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these
obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to
cancellation.   

          We
have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above. Our historical practice regarding these plans
has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Further information on these plans,
including our expected contributions for 2009, is included in Note 27.   

          We
do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or
the availability of capital resources.

    Critical Accounting Estimates     

          Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis
and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our
senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial
statements require significant estimation or judgment:   

    Inventory and cost of sales       We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method,
inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's
ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the
lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts.
Historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has
diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, changing consumer credit markets or increasing
competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than six months. Inventory is further described in Note 11.   

    Vendor income receivable       Cost of sales and SG A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is
earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable for the
vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and the amount earned. The
majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter. Vendor income is described further in Note 4.   

    Allowance for doubtful accounts       When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future
write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of
delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when
they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions;
however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. We believe that the allowance
recorded at January 31, 2009 is sufficient to cover currently anticipated losses. Credit card receivables are described in Note 10.   

    Analysis of long-lived and intangible assets for impairment       We review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, usually
at the store level. An impairment loss on a long-lived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and
disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounted future cash flows. No
material impairments were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed.   

    Insurance/self-insurance       We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and
team member medical and dental claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate   

20  

Table of Contents   

our
ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value;
other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate, although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided. We maintain stop-loss
coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks associated with our insurance policies.   

Income taxes       We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax
issues have been materially accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22.   

    Pension and postretirement health care accounting       We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified
plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in
the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of
service.   

          Our
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market
conditions.   

          The
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the
measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Historically, this same discount rate has also been used to determine pension and
postretirement health care expense for the following plan year. Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" (SFAS 158). The discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and
benefits expense are included in Note 27. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.1 percent increase to the weighted
average discount rate used to determine pension and postretirement health care expenses would decrease annual expense by approximately $4 million.   

Based
on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does
for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.   

          Pension
and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27.   

New Accounting Pronouncements   

2008 Adoptions     

          In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value,
provides guidance for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157, as originally issued, was effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, which deferred the effective date of SFAS 157
for one year, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. We adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008, and the adoption had
no impact to our consolidated net earnings, cash flows and financial position. Subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 157, the FASB has issued various other FASB Staff Positions and guidance on
fair value measurement; the additional guidance has not had an impact on our adoption. We will adopt SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities at the beginning of 2009 and do not expect
to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.   

          In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We adopted SFAS 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2008, and the adoption had no impact to our consolidated net
earnings, cash flows or financial position.   

          In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" (SFAS 161).
SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 161, as originally issued, was effective at the beginning of fiscal   

  21  

Table of Contents   

  2009.
However, in October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, which, amongst other actions, accelerated the effective date of
SFAS 161 to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Since SFAS 161 requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging
activities, the adoption of SFAS 161 did not have any impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.   

          In
November 2008, the FASB Staff Position FAS 140-e and FIN 46(R)-e, Disclosures about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable
Interest Entities (the FSP) was published with an effective date for periods ending December 15, 2008. The FSP is intended to enhance currently required disclosures until the pending amendments
to SFAS 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities," are published. Since the FSP requires only additional disclosures related to certain asset transfers, the adoption of the FSP did not have any impact on our consolidated
net earnings, cash flows or financial position.   

    Future Adoptions     

          In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141(R)), which changes the accounting
for business combinations and their effects on the financial statements. SFAS 141(R) will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.   

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51"
(SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as equity in their consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 will be effective at the
beginning of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this statement is
not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.   

    Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009     

          We anticipate that the challenging economic and consumer environment we experienced in 2008 will continue into 2009. In the first half
of 2009, in our Retail Segment, we expect a continuation of recent sales trends   specifically mid-single digit declines in overall comparable-store sales with stronger
growth in our lower-margin non-discretionary categories than in our higher-margin home and apparel categories. This sales performance will likely lead to a moderate decline in our gross
margin rate because it is unlikely that we will be able to offset the impact of the adverse sales mix with rate improvements within categories. Even in light of continued strong expense control, we
expect a moderate de-leveraging in our SG A expense rate as a result of our expectation for soft comparable store sales. As a result, we expect to generate EBITDA and EBIT in our Retail
Segment below last year's levels for the first half of the year.   

          In
our Credit Card Segment we expect net write-offs to stabilize in the range of $300 million in each of the first two quarters of 2009, levels which were anticipated
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of fiscal 2008. We do not anticipate the need to add any meaningful reserves in the foreseeable future, especially in light of the high
likelihood that we will experience modest decreases in gross receivables. Overall, we expect to generate moderate rates of profit in the Credit Card Segment in the first two quarters of 2009, though
it is not likely to be as strong as the profits generated in the first two quarters of 2008.   

In
light of the current environment, we are being very deliberate in the management and application of cash resources. This means that we have planned for fewer stores to open in 2009,
particularly in our October cycle, than we would have in a more robust environment. Specifically, we expect to open about 75 stores in 2009, or about 60 stores net of rebuilds and relocations. Based
on these store opening expectations, our base capital investment plan for 2009 envisions investing just over $2 billion, with the possibility that it might be as high as $2.5 billion if
we were to see clear and measurable signs of improvement in the economy that lead us to approve incremental store openings in 2010 and beyond.   

We
expect to again generate more than $4 billion in cash from operations in 2009, which, in light of our current suspension of substantially all share repurchase activity, would
provide ample cash from internal sources to fund our projected capital investments, pay dividends on our common stock and fund the $1.3 billion of debt that is maturing in 2009, all without the
need to access the term debt capital markets during the year.   

          Our
expectation is for earnings per share (diluted) in the first two quarters of 2009 to be well below 2008 levels, in line with our experience in the fourth quarter of 2008. Whether our
performance will improve in the   

  22  

Table of Contents   

  last
two quarters of 2009 will depend on the extent to which economic conditions improve, and in turn to what extent our Retail Segment sales improve, and to a lesser degree when, and to what extent,
we begin to experience clear and measurable benefits of recent risk management efforts in the Credit Card Segment.   

Forward-Looking Statements   

          This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are
typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include:
The expected earnings per share (diluted) for the first two quarters of 2009; for our Retail Segment, our outlook for sales trends, gross margin rates, SG A expense rate, and EBITDA and EBIT; for our
Credit Card Segment, our outlook for future write-offs of current receivables, profit, and the allowance for doubtful accounts; the expected cash generated from operations in 2009; our expected
capital expenditures and the number of stores to be opened in 2009; the expected compliance with debt covenants; and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation, property
loss, team member medical and dental claims, workforce reduction costs, the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties.   

          All
such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our
actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in
conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking
statement.    

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk            

          Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at
a LIBOR-plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime-based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we
generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. Our degree of floating asset and liability
matching may vary over time and vary in different interest rate environments. At January 31, 2009, our level of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded our level of net
floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $1.3 billion. As a result, based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a half percentage
point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income
taxes by approximately $7 million. See further description in Note 20.   

We
record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically and in
certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest
rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2009, the annualized effect of a one percentage point
decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $19 million.   

          In
addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on
pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $18 million at January 31, 2009. The resulting impact on net pension expense would be calculated consistent with the provisions of SFAS
No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions." The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against declines in interest rates we hold
high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year end, we had hedged approximately 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of
our funded status.   

          As
more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation
plans. We control our risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion
of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect
of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.   

          We
do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in
U.S. dollars.   

          Overall,
there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.

Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data            

    Report of Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements     

           Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity and presentation of the information in the Annual Report. The consolidated
financial statements and other information presented in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include necessary
judgments and estimates by management.   

           To
fulfill our responsibility, we maintain comprehensive systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in
accordance with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of
internal control provide this reasonable assurance.   

           The
Board of Directors exercised its oversight role with respect to the Corporation's systems of internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised of four
independent directors. The Committee oversees the Corporation's systems of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and audits to assess whether their quality, integrity and
objectivity are sufficient to protect shareholders' investments.   

           In
addition, our consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, whose report also appears on this
page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements     

   The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

           We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of January 31,
2009 and February 2, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended January 31,
2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.   

           We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

           In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries at
January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.   

           As
discussed in Note 27, Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans, to the consolidated financial statements, effective February 3, 2007, the Corporation adopted the
recognition and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158,    Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).    Also, effective February 4, 2007, the Corporation adopted the
measurement provision of SFAS No. 158.   

           We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2009, based on criteria established in    Internal Control Integrated Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    Report of Management on Internal Control     

           Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on the framework in    Internal Control Integrated
Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we conclude that the Corporation's internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.   

           Our
internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered accounting firm who has also
audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report which appears on this page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

   The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

           We have audited Target Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in    Internal Control Integrated Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). The Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.   

           We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

           A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

           Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   

           In
our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.   

           We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Target
Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders' investment for each of the
three years in the period ended January 31, 2009, and our report dated March 11, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   

1. Summary of Accounting Policies   

    Organization       Target Corporation (the Corporation or Target) operates two reportable segments: Retail and Credit Card. Our Retail Segment includes all of our
merchandising operations, including the operation of our large-format general merchandise and food discount stores in the United States and our fully integrated online business, Target.com. Our Credit
Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and the Target Card (collectively, REDcards). Our Credit Card Segment strengthens the bond
with our guests, drives incremental sales and contributes to our results of operations.   

    Consolidation       The consolidated financial statements include the balances of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and
transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of those entities'
operations. The variable interest entity consolidated is a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary through which we sell certain accounts receivable as a method of providing funding for our accounts receivable.   

    Use of estimates       The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.   

    Fiscal year       Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years,
rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended January 31, 2009 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended February 2, 2008 and consisted of
52 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 (2006) ended February 3, 2007 and consisted of 53 weeks.   

    Reclassifications       Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.   

Accounting
policies applicable to the items discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement are described in the respective notes.   

2. Revenues   

          Our retail stores generally record revenue at the point of sale. Sales from our online business include shipping revenue and are
recorded upon delivery to the guest. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return
merchandise within 90 days of purchase. Revenues are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns. Commissions earned on sales generated by leased
departments are included within sales and were $19 million in 2008, $17 million in 2007, and $16 million in 2006. A leased business is an agreement we enter into with another
entity such as Starbucks or Pizza Hut where the entity's products and services are offered in our stores.   

          Revenue
from gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption. Our gift cards do not have expiration dates. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable
percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was immaterial in 2008,
2007, and 2006.   

          Credit
card revenues are recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement. When accounts are written off, uncollected finance charges and late fees are
recorded as a reduction of credit card revenues. Target retail store sales charged to our credit cards totaled $3,854 million, $4,105 million, and $3,961 million in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. We offer new account discounts and rewards programs on our REDcard products. These discounts are redeemable only on purchases made at Target. The discounts associated with our
REDcard products are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were $114 million in 2008, $110 million in 2007 and $104 million in 2006.

3. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

          During the first quarter of 2008, we reviewed our Consolidated Statements of Operations cost classification policy, primarily related
to distribution and other supply chain costs that were previously classified within selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A). The review was prompted by changes within our supply chain
processes and infrastructure, primarily the opening of our own food distribution network. As a result of this review, we have reclassified certain costs within our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The most significant change is that distribution center costs are now presented within cost of sales, as opposed to SG A. We have reclassified all prior periods to conform to the current
year presentation.   

          The
following table illustrates the primary costs classified in each major expense category:   

Cost of Sales   
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

Total cost of products sold including 
    Freight expenses associated with moving 
    merchandise from our vendors to our 
    distribution centers and our retail stores, and 
    among our distribution and retail facilities 
    Vendor income that is not reimbursement of 
    specific, incremental and identifiable costs 
Inventory shrink 
Markdowns 
Outbound shipping and handling expenses 
    associated with sales to our guests 
Terms cash discount 
Distribution center costs, including compensation 
    and benefits costs  
     
  Compensation and benefit costs including 
    Stores 
    Headquarters 
Occupancy and operating costs of retail and 
    headquarters facilities 
Advertising, offset by vendor income that is a 
    reimbursement of specific, incremental and 
    identifiable costs 
Pre-opening costs of stores and other facilities 
Other administrative costs  

The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.     

4. Consideration Received from Vendors   

          We receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and
advertising and for our compliance programs, referred to as "vendor income." Vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or SG A based on the provisions of the arrangement. Promotional and
advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores. Under our compliance programs, vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not
meet our requirements (violations), such as late or incomplete shipments. These allowances are recorded when violations occur. Substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of
cost of sales.   

          We
establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating the amount
earned when we have completed our performance. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate. The majority of year-end receivables
associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter.   

5. Advertising Costs   

          Advertising costs are expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement and were $1,233 million in 2008,
$1,195 million in 2007 and $1,170 million in 2006. Advertising vendor income that offset advertising expenses was approximately $143 million, $123 million and
$118 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Newspaper circulars and media broadcast made up the majority of our advertising costs in all three years.   

  31  

Table of Contents   

6. Earnings per Share   

          Basic earnings per share (EPS) is net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and the incremental shares assumed to be issued under performance share and restricted stock unit
arrangements.   

For the 2008, 2007 and 2006 EPS computations, 10.5 million, 6.3 million and 1.8 million stock options, respectively, were
excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive. Refer to Note 26 for a description of the prepaid forward contracts referred to
in the table above.   

7. Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)   

          Other comprehensive income/(loss) includes revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings under GAAP and are
recorded directly to shareholders' investment. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, other comprehensive income/(loss) included gains and losses on certain hedge transactions, the change in our minimum pension
liability (prior to the adoption of SFAS 158), and amortization of pension and postretirement plan amounts, net of related taxes. Significant items affecting other comprehensive income/(loss)
are shown in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Investment.   

8. Fair Value Measurements   

          In the first quarter of 2008, we adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price at which an asset could be exchanged
in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that
would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSPs FAS 157-1 and FAS 157-2, which removed leasing transactions from
the scope of SFAS 157 and deferred for one year the effective date for SFAS 157 as it applies to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities.   

          Assets
and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized using defined hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair
valuation of an asset or liability: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in
Level 1, either directly or indirectly); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are
categorized based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations.   

  32  

Table of Contents    

          In determining fair value we use observable market data when available. Additionally, we consider both counterparty credit risk and our own creditworthiness in
determining fair value. We attempt to mitigate credit risk to third parties by entering into netting and collateral arrangements. In those instances, the net exposure is then measured considering the
counterparty's creditworthiness.   

The following sets forth the types of assets measured at fair value and a brief description of the valuation technique for each asset type:   

Position description   
     
   Valuation Technique   

Marketable securities  
     
  Initially valued at transaction price. Carrying value of cash equivalents (including money market funds) approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months.  

Prepaid forward contracts  
     
      Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the market price of Target common stock.  

Interest rate swaps/forward  
     
      Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation
model (   e.g.   , interest rates, credit spreads, etc.). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data. A credit risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit
spreads.  

Company-owned life insurance investments  
     
      Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the index fund in which the investment position is
held. The market values of these investments are determined based upon quoted market prices.  

9. Cash Equivalents   

          Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase. We
carry these investments at cost, which approximates fair value. These investments totaled $302 million and $1,851 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008,
respectively.   

          Also
included in cash equivalents are amounts due from credit card transactions with settlement terms of less than five days. Receivables resulting from third-party credit card sales
within our Retail Segment are included within cash equivalents and were $323 million and $400 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. Payables
resulting from the use of the Target Visa at third-party merchants are included within cash equivalents and were $53 million and $60 million at January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, respectively.   

10. Credit Card Receivables   

          Credit card receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance, recognized in an amount equal to the
anticipated future write-offs of existing receivables, was $1,010 million at January 31, 2009 and $570 million at February 2, 2008. This allowance includes
provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends, and
industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to   

  33  

Table of Contents   

accrue
finance charges until they are written off. Total accounts receivable past due ninety days or more and still accruing finance charges were $393 million at January 31, 2009 and
$235 million at February 2, 2008. Accounts are written off when they become 180 days past due.   

          As
a method of providing funding for our accounts receivable, we sell on an ongoing basis all of our consumer credit card receivables to Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), a wholly
owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. TRC then transfers the receivables to the Target Credit Card Master Trust (the Trust), which from time to time will sell debt securities to third parties either
directly or through a related trust. These debt securities represent undivided interests in the Trust assets. TRC uses the proceeds from the sale of debt securities and its share of collections on the
receivables to pay the purchase price of the receivables to Target.   

          We
consolidate the receivables within the Trust and any debt securities issued by the Trust, or a related trust, in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based upon the
applicable accounting guidance. The receivables transferred to the Trust are not available to general creditors of Target. The payments to the holders of the debt securities issued by the Trust or the
related trust are made solely from the assets transferred to the Trust or the related trust, and are nonrecourse to the general assets of Target. Upon termination of the securitization program and
repayment of all debt securities, any remaining assets could be distributed to Target in a liquidation of TRC.   

          In
the second quarter of 2008, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to a JPMorgan Chase affiliate (JPMC). The interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables
portfolio at the time of the transaction. This transaction was accounted for as a secured borrowing, and accordingly, the receivables within the trust and the note payable issued by the trust are
reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Notwithstanding this accounting treatment, the receivables transferred to the trust are not available to general creditors of Target,
and the payments to JPMC are made solely from the trust assets and are nonrecourse to the general assets of Target. The accounts receivable assets that collateralize the note payable supply the cash
flow to pay principal and interest to the note holder. Periodic interest payments due on the note are satisfied provided the cash flows from the trust assets are sufficient. If the cash flows are less
than the periodic interest, the available amount, if any, is paid with respect to interest. Interest shortfalls will be paid to the extent subsequent cash flows from the assets in the trust are
sufficient.   

          In
the event of a decrease in the receivables principal amount such that JPMC's interest in the entire portfolio would exceed 47 percent for three consecutive months, TRC (using
the cash flows from the assets in the trust) would pay JPMC a pro rata amount of principal collections such that the interest owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent. Conversely, at the
option of the Corporation, JPMC may
be required to fund an increase in the portfolio to maintain their 47 percent interest up to a maximum JPMC principal balance of $4.2 billion. If a three month average of monthly finance
charge excess (JPMC's prorata share of finance charge collections less write-offs and specified expenses) is less than 2 percent of the outstanding principal balance of JPMC's
interest, the Corporation must implement mutually agreed upon underwriting strategies. If the three month average finance charge excess falls below 1 percent of the outstanding principal
balance of JPMC's interest, JPMC may compel the Corporation to implement underwriting and collections activities, provided those activities are compatible with the Corporation's systems, as well as
consistent with similar credit card receivable portfolios managed by JPMC. If the Corporation fails to implement the activities, JPMC may cause the accelerated repayment of the note payable issued in
the transaction.   

11. Inventory   

          Substantially all of our inventory and the related cost of sales are accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method (RIM)
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventory is stated at the lower of LIFO cost or market. Cost includes purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Inventory is
also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. The LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally measured retail price indices.   

          Under
RIM, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value inventory. RIM is an averaging
method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are
currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.   

          We
routinely enter into arrangements with certain vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Revenues under this
program are included in sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position because of the virtually   

  34  

Table of Contents   

  simultaneous
purchase and sale of this inventory. Sales made under these arrangements totaled $1,266 million in 2008, $1,390 million in 2007, and $1,178 million in 2006.   

12. Other Current Assets   

(a)       Other receivables relate primarily to pharmacy receivables and merchandise sourcing services provided to third parties.      (b)      Amount includes held-to-maturity government and money market investments that are held to satisfy the capital requirements of Target
Bank and Target National Bank. In 2008 and 2007 the carrying value of these investments were $29 million and $25 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of these investments
using available market prices in 2008 and 2007 did not materially differ from the carrying amount.    

13. Property and Equipment   

          Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives or lease term if shorter. We amortize leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term over the shorter of
the assets' useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired. Depreciation expense for
2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1,804 million, $1,644 million and $1,509 million, respectively. For income tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are generally used. Repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and were $609 million in 2008, $592 million in 2007 and $532 million in 2006. Facility pre-opening costs, including supplies
and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's
carrying value may not be recoverable. No material impairments were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed.   

14. Other Noncurrent Assets   

(a)       Company-owned life insurance policies on approximately 4,000 team members who are designated highly compensated under the Internal Revenue Code and have given their consent to be
insured.      (b)      See Notes 8 and 20 for additional information relating to our interest rate swaps.    

15. Goodwill and Intangible Assets   

          Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded within other noncurrent assets at cost less accumulated amortization. Goodwill totaled
$60 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. An impairment loss on a   

  35  

Table of Contents   

long-lived
and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset
carrying amount. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is subject to an annual impairment test. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value for the purposes of the required annual
impairment analysis.   

          No
material impairments were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as a result of the tests performed. Intangible assets by major classes were as follows:   

(a)       Other intangible assets relate primarily to acquired trade names and customer lists.      

          Amortization is computed on intangible assets with definite useful lives using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives
that range from three to 39 years. During 2006, we adjusted the period over which we amortize leasehold acquisition costs to match the expected terms for individual leases resulting in a
cumulative benefit to amortization expense of approximately $28 million. Amortization expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $21 million, $15 million, and $(13) million,
respectively.   

16. Accounts Payable   

          We reclassify book overdrafts to accounts payable at period end. Overdrafts reclassified to accounts payable were $606 million
at January 31, 2009 and $588 million at February 2, 2008.   

17. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities   

(a)       Taxes payable consist of real estate, team member withholdings and sales tax liabilities.        (b)       Gift card liability
represents the amount of gift cards that have been issued but have not been redeemed, net of estimated breakage.      

18. Commitments and Contingencies   

          Purchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise
royalties, equipment purchases, marketing related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts, were approximately $570 million and $663 million at
January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. We issue inventory purchase orders, which represent authorizations   

  36  

Table of Contents   

to
purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are
not firm commitments as they are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays
incurred prior to cancellation under certain circumstances.   

          Trade
letters of credit totaled $1,359 million and $1,861 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, a portion of which are reflected in
accounts payable. Standby letters of credit, relating primarily to retained risk on our insurance claims, totaled $64 million and $69 million at January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, respectively.   

          We
are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest
of our shareholders and other constituents. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe
that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.   

19. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt   

          We obtain short-term financing throughout the year under our commercial paper program, a form of notes payable.   

In April 2007, we entered into a five-year $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which will
expire in 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2008 or 2007 under this or previously existing revolving credit facilities.   

          We
did not issue any unsecured, long-term debt during 2008. We issued various long-term, unsecured debt instruments during 2007. Information on these transactions
is as follows:   

As further explained in Note 10, we maintain an accounts receivable financing program through which we sell credit card receivables to a
bankruptcy remote, wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn transfers the receivables to a trust. The trust, either directly or through related trusts, sells debt securities to third parties. The
following summarizes this activity for fiscal 2007 and 2008.   

(a)       Represents the accretion of the 7 percent discount on the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC.

Table of Contents   

          Other than debt backed by our credit card receivables and other immaterial borrowings, all of our outstanding borrowings are senior, unsecured
obligations.   

          At
January 31, 2009, the carrying value and maturities of our debt portfolio, including swap valuation adjustments for our fair value hedges, was as follows:   

(a)       Reflects the weighted average stated interest rate as of year-end.        (b)       The estimated fair value of total notes and
debentures, using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments,
was $17,553 million at January 31, 2009.    

          Required principal payments on notes and debentures over the next five years, excluding capital lease obligations, are as follows:   

Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant,
our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants.   

20. Derivative Financial Instruments   

Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value on the balance sheet. Our derivative instruments have been primarily
interest rate swaps. We use these derivatives to mitigate our interest rate risk.   

          Historically,
the majority of our derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
(SFAS 133). The changes in market value of an interest rate swap, as well as the offsetting change in market value of the hedged debt, were recognized within earnings in the current period. We
assessed at the inception of the hedge whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. Ineffectiveness resulted when changes in
the market value of the hedged debt were not completely offset by changes in the market value of the interest rate swap. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, 100 percent hedge effectiveness
was assumed for those derivatives whose terms met the conditions of the SFAS 133 "short-cut method." There was no ineffectiveness recognized in 2008, 2007 or 2006 related to our
derivative instruments. As detailed below, at January 31, 2009, we had no derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges.   

          During
the first quarter of 2008, we terminated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $3,125 million for cash proceeds of
$160 million, which are classified within other operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Because these swaps were designated as hedges, and concurrent with their
terminations, we were required to stop making market value adjustments to the associated hedged debt. Gains realized upon termination will be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the
associated hedge debt.   

  38  

Table of Contents   

          Additionally,
during 2008, we de-designated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps, and upon de-designation, these swaps no longer qualified for hedge
accounting treatment. As a result of the de-designation, the unrealized gains on these swaps determined at the date of de-designation will be amortized into earnings over the
remaining lives of the previously hedged items.   

          Simultaneous
to the de-designations, we entered into "pay fixed" swaps to economically hedge the risks associated with the de-designated "pay floating" swaps.
These swaps are not designated as hedging instruments and along with the de-designated "pay floating" swaps are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis. Changes in fair value
measurements are a component of net interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

At January 31, 2009 a characteristic summary of interest rate swaps outstanding was:

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, total net gains amortized into net interest expense for terminated and dedesignated swaps were $55 million,
$6 million and $9 million, respectively. The amount remaining on unamortized hedged debt valuation gains from terminated and de-designated interest rate swaps that will be
amortized into earnings over the remaining lives totaled $263 million, $14 million and $19 million, at the end of 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

During 2007, we entered into a series of interest rate lock agreements that effectively fixed the interest payments on our anticipated issuance of
debt that would be affected by interest-rate fluctuations on the U.S. Treasury benchmark between the beginning date of the interest rate locks and the date of the issuance of the debt.
Upon our issuance of fixed-rate debt in fiscal 2007, we terminated these rate lock agreements with a combined notional amount of $2.5 billion for cash payment of $79 million,
which is classified within other   

  39

operating
cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The loss of $48 million, net of taxes of $31 million, has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is
being recognized as an adjustment to net interest expense over the same period in which the related interest costs on the debt are recognized in earnings. During 2007, the amount reclassified into
earnings was not material. During 2008, the amount reclassified into earnings as an increase to interest expense from accumulated other comprehensive income was $3 million ($5 million
pre tax). The amount expected to be reclassified
into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income for 2009 is expected to be $3 million ($5 million pre tax).   

          Periodic
payments, valuation adjustments and amortization of gains or losses from the termination or de-designation of derivative contracts are summarized below:   

(a)       These derivatives are used to mitigate interest rate exposure on our discounted workers' compensation and general liability obligations.    

21. Leases   

          We lease certain retail locations, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, equipment and land. Assets held under capital lease
are included in property and equipment. Operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. At lease inception, we determine the lease term by
assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured because of the significant economic penalty that exists for not exercising those options. The exercise of lease renewal
options is at our sole discretion. The expected lease term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate straight-line rent expense. Additionally,
the depreciable life of buildings and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term.   

          Rent
expense on buildings, which is included in SG A, includes rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels for certain stores. Total rent expense was
$169 million in 2008, $165 million in 2007 and $158 million in 2006, including percentage rent expense of $4 million in 2008 and $5 million in 2007 and 2006. Certain
leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These expenses are classified in SG A consistent with similar costs
for owned locations. Most long-term leases include
one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to more than fifty years. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.   

(a)       Total contractual lease payments include $1,830 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes
$164 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that will open in 2009 or later.      (b)      Calculated using the interest rate at inception for each lease.
      (c)       Includes the current portion of $5 million.

22. Income Taxes   

          We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date. We have not recorded deferred taxes when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Such
amounts are not significant. In the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the current deferred tax asset balance is the net of all current deferred tax assets and current deferred
tax liabilities. The noncurrent deferred tax liability is the net of all noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities.   

Our effective income tax rate was 37.4 percent in 2008, 38.4 percent in 2007 and 38.0 percent in 2006. The decrease in 2008
was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues. The 2008 effective income tax rate is also lower due to a comparatively
greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions. These rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically
hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans. Gains and losses from these investments are not taxable. The increase in the 2007 effective rate from the prior year was primarily due to lower
capital market returns on these investments as compared to 2006.   

41  

Table of Contents   

          We file a U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no
longer subject to income tax examinations for years before 1999.   

If the Corporation were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefit liabilities recorded, approximately $208 million of the
$434 million reserve would benefit the effective tax rate. In addition, the impact of penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties associated with
unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are recorded within income tax expense. During the years ended January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, we recognized
approximately $33 million, $37 million and $37 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. We had accrued for the payment of interest and penalties of approximately
$153 million at January 31, 2009 and $129 million at February 2, 2008.   

          Included
in the balance at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 are $116 million and $72 million, respectively, of liabilities for tax positions for which
the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate, but would accelerate the cash payment to the taxing authority to an earlier period.   

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next
twelve months; however, we do not currently expect any change to have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position.   

23. Other Noncurrent Liabilities     

We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability and workers' compensation claims. Liabilities associated with
these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General
liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.   

24. Share Repurchase     

          In November 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program totaling $10 billion that replaced a prior program.
In November 2008, we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open-market share repurchase program.   

  42  

Table of Contents   

          Share
repurchases for the last three years, repurchased primarily through open market transactions, were as follows:   

Of the shares reacquired and included above, a portion was delivered upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. The prepaid forward contracts
settled in 2008 had a total cash investment of $249 million and an aggregate market value of $251 million at their respective settlement dates. The prepaid forward contracts settled in
2007 had a total cash investment of $165 million and an aggregate market value of $215 million at their respective settlement dates. The prepaid forward contracts settled in 2006 had a
total cash investment of $76 million and an aggregate market value of $88 million at their respective settlement dates. These contracts are among the investment vehicles used to reduce
our economic exposure related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The details of our positions in prepaid forward contracts have been provided in Note 26.   

          Our
share repurchases during 2008 included 30 million shares that were acquired through the exercise of call options.   

(a)       Paid in January 2008.      

25. Share-Based Compensation     

          We maintain a long-term incentive plan for key team members and non-employee members of our Board of Directors.
Our long-term incentive plan allows us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share unit awards, restricted stock unit
awards, or a combination of awards. A majority of granted awards are nonqualified stock options that vest annually in equal amounts over a four-year period and expire no later than
10 years after the grant date. Options granted to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors become exercisable after one year and have a 10-year term. We have
issued performance share unit awards annually since January 2003. These awards represent shares potentially issuable in the future based upon the attainment of compound annual growth rates in revenue
and EPS as set forth in the performance criteria. In 2006 and 2008, we issued restricted stock units with three-year cliff vesting to select team members. We also regularly issue
restricted stock units to our Board of Directors. Restricted stock units granted in 2008 have one-year graded vesting. The number of unissued   

  43  

Table of Contents   

common
shares reserved for future grants under the share-based compensation plans was 25,755,800 at January 31, 2009 and 36,190,569 at February 2, 2008.   

(a)       Includes Stock Appreciation Rights granted to certain non-U.S. team members.        (b)       Weighted average per share.
      (c)       Represents stock price appreciation subsequent to the grant date, in millions.        (d)       Assumes attainment
of maximum compound annual growth rates as set forth in the performance criteria.        (e)       Awards were earned based on performance during the three years ending January 31,
2009.        (f)       Awards will be earned based on performance during the three years ending January 30, 2010.
        (g)       Awards will be earned based on performance during the three years ending January 29, 2011.        (h)      
  Includes differences resulting from attainment of actual versus maximum compound annual growth rates as set forth in the performance criteria. The number of share units not attained
was approximately 133 thousand.        (i)       Based on performance criteria for the three years ending January 31, 2009, we expect approximately 637 thousand share units will not be
attained in 2009.      

          We used a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at grant date based on the assumptions noted in the following
table. Volatility represents an average of market quotes for implied volatility of 5.5-year options on Target common stock. The expected life is estimated based on an analysis of options
already exercised and any foreseeable trends or changes in recipients' behavior. The risk-free interest rate is an interpolation of the relevant U.S. Treasury security maturities as of
each applicable grant date. The assumptions disclosed below represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for all of our stock option grants throughout the years.   

Total share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $72 million, $73 million, and
$99 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The related income tax benefit was $28 million, $28 million, and $39 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.   

44  

Table of Contents   

          At January 31, 2009, there was $173 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options. That cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. The weighted average remaining life of currently exercisable options is 4.8 years, and the weighted average
remaining life of all outstanding options is 6.8 years. The total fair value of options vested was $51 million, $35 million, and $47 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively.   

          Performance
share unit award recipients will receive shares of common stock if certain revenue and EPS growth targets are met and the recipients also satisfy service-based vesting
requirements. Compensation expense associated with outstanding performance share units is recorded over the life of the awards. The expense recorded each period is dependent upon our estimate of the
number of shares that will ultimately be issued and, for some awards, the current Target common stock price. Future compensation expense for currently outstanding awards could reach a maximum of
$57 million assuming payout of all outstanding awards. The total share based liabilities paid were $15 million and $18 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were no share
based liabilities paid in 2006.   

          In
2008, we recorded a $12 million reversal of previously recorded expense related to performance share units that were to be paid to award recipients at the end of the fiscal
year. The related performance share units will not be delivered to award recipients because we did not meet certain revenue and EPS compound annual growth rates as set forth in the performance
criteria.   

          Total
unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards was $14 million as of January 31, 2009.   

26. Defined Contribution Plans     

          Team members who meet certain eligibility requirements can participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan by investing up to
80 percent of their compensation, as limited by statute or regulation. Generally, we match 100 percent of each team member's contribution up to 5 percent of total compensation.
Our contribution to the plan is initially invested in Target common stock. These amounts are free to be diversified by the team member immediately.   

In
addition, we maintain nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans for approximately 4,000 current and retired team members whose participation in our 401(k) plan is limited by
statute or regulation. These team members choose from a menu of crediting rate alternatives that are the same as the investment choices in our 401(k) plan, including Target common stock. We credit an
additional 2 percent per year to the accounts of all active participants, excluding executive officer participants, in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation in a plan of
this nature. We also maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan that was frozen during 1996, covering 11 active and 52 retired participants. In this plan deferred compensation earns
returns tied to market levels of interest rates, plus an additional 6 percent return, with a minimum of 12 percent and a maximum of 20 percent, as determined by the plan's terms.   

          The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 added Section 409A to the Internal Revenue Code, changing the federal income tax treatment of nonqualified deferred compensation
arrangements. Failure to comply with the new requirements would result in early taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, as well as a 20 percent penalty tax and additional
interest payable to the IRS. In response to these new requirements, we allowed participants to elect to accelerate the distribution dates for their account balances. Participant elections resulted in
payments of $86 million in 2008 and $74 million in 2007.   

          We
control some of our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through investing in vehicles, including prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock, that offset a substantial
portion of our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These investment vehicles are general corporate assets and are marked-to-market with the related gains and
losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur. The total change in fair value for contracts indexed to our own common stock recorded in earnings was
pre-tax income/(loss) of $(19) million in 2008, $6 million in 2007 and $37 million in 2006. During 2008 and 2007, we invested approximately $215 million and
$164 million, respectively, in such investment instruments, and these investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within other investing activities. Adjusting our
position in these investment vehicles may involve repurchasing shares of Target common stock when settling the forward contracts. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, these   

  45  

Table of Contents   

  repurchases
totaled 4.7 million, 3.4 million and 1.6 million shares, respectively, and are included in the total share repurchases described in Note 24.   

The settlement dates of these instruments are regularly renegotiated with the counterparty, so settlement may not occur during the months listed
on the table above.   

(a)       Investment income includes changes in unrealized gains and losses on prepaid forward contracts and realized gains and losses on company-owned life insurance policies.      

27. Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans     

          We have qualified defined benefit pension plans covering all U.S. team members who meet age and service requirements, including in
certain circumstances date of hire. We also have unfunded nonqualified pension plans for team members with qualified plan compensation restrictions. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits
varies depending on team members' date of hire, length of service and/or team member compensation. Upon retirement, team members also become eligible for certain health care benefits if they meet
minimum age and service requirements and agree to contribute a portion of the cost.   

          SFAS
No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)"
(SFAS 158) requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively postretirement benefit plans) to recognize the funded status of their
postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year-end statement of
financial position and provide additional disclosures.   

          At
the beginning of fiscal 2007, we early adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 which require us to measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as
of the date of the year-end statement of financial position. Before 2007, we measured our pension and postretirement benefit obligations at the end of October each year. As a result, we
recorded a $16 million decrease to retained earnings, a $54 million increase to accumulated other comprehensive income, a $65 million increase to other noncurrent assets, a
$3 million increase to other noncurrent liabilities, and a $24 million decrease to deferred income taxes. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 had no effect
on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at February 4, 2007 or any prior periods.   

  46  

Table of Contents   

          We
adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 on February 3, 2007, which require us to recognize the funded status, which is the difference between the
fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations, of our postretirement benefit plans in the February 3, 2007 Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding
adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized
prior service costs. The adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS 158 had no effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations at February 3, 2007 or any prior periods.   

          The
following table provides a summary of the changes in the benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position for our postretirement benefit plans:

The discount rate used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year is the rate as of the beginning of the year
(   i.e   ., the prior measurement date). With an essentially stable asset allocation over the following time periods, our annualized rate of return on
qualified plans' assets has averaged 6.3 percent, 5.7 percent and 8.8 percent for the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year periods, respectively, ended
January 31, 2009.   

          An
increase in the cost of covered health care benefits of 9 percent was assumed for 2008. In 2009, the rate is assumed to be 8 percent for non-Medicare
eligible individuals and 9 percent for Medicare eligible individuals. Both rates will be reduced to 5 percent in 2013 and thereafter.   

          A
one percent change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects at January 31, 2009:

    Additional Information     

          Our pension plan weighted average asset allocations at the measurement date by asset category were as follows:   

(a)       Other assets include private equity, mezzanine and distressed debt, a balanced portfolio of global equities and global fixed income securities, timber-related assets, and a
5 percent allocation to real estate.      

          Our asset allocation strategy targets 32 percent in domestic equity securities, 18 percent in international equity securities,
23 percent in high quality, long-duration debt securities, including interest rate swaps, and 27 percent in alternative assets. Equity securities include our common stock in
amounts substantially less than 1 percent of total plan assets as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. Our expected annualized long-term rate of return
assumptions as of January 31, 2009 were 8.5 percent for domestic and international equity securities, 5.5 percent for long-duration debt securities, and 9.5 percent for
other assets.   

    Contributions     

          We are not required to make any contributions in 2009, although we may choose to make discretionary contributions of up to
$100 million. We expect to make contributions in the range of $5 million to $15 million to our postretirement health care benefit plan in 2009.   

Estimated Future Benefit Payments     

          Benefit payments by the plans, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:   

28. Segment Reporting   

          Prior to 2008, we operated as a single business segment. During the first quarter of 2008 our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Robert
Ulrich, who was our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as defined in SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" (SFAS 131), retired, and he was
succeeded by Gregg Steinhafel. As a result of this change and in light of the anticipated sale of an undivided interest in approximately one-half of our credit card receivables, we
reevaluated the provisions of SFAS 131. Based upon our review performed in the first quarter of 2008, we determined that we have two reportable segments, which reflects how our new CODM reviews
our results in terms of allocating resources and assessing performance. These two reportable segments are based on our different products and services: Retail and Credit Card. As a result, prior
period disclosures reflect the change in reportable segments.   

  50  

Table of Contents   

          Our
measure of profit for each segment is a measure that management considers analytically useful in measuring the return we are achieving on our investment.   

(a)       The combination of bad debt expense and operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment represent credit card expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
      (b)       New account and loyalty rewards redeemed by our guests reduce reported sales. Our Retail Segment charges the cost of these discounts to our Credit Card Segment, and the
reimbursements
of $117 million in 2008, $114 million in 2007 and $109 million in 2006 are recorded as a reduction to SG A expenses within the Retail Segment and an increase to operations and
marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.    

Note: The sum of the segment amounts may not equal the total amounts due to rounding.   

Substantially all of our revenues are generated in, and long-lived assets are located in, the United States.   

29. Quarterly Results (Unaudited)   

          Due to the seasonal nature of our business, fourth quarter operating results typically represent a substantially larger share of total
year revenues and earnings because they include our peak sales period from Thanksgiving through the end of December. We follow the same accounting policies for preparing quarterly and annual financial
data. The table below summarizes quarterly results for 2008 and 2007:   

(a)       Per share amounts are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the quarters may not equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes in average
quarterly shares outstanding.      

Note: The sum of the quarterly amounts may not equal the total year amounts due to rounding.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures            

          As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the
participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

          There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ARTICLE I   

   ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLAN

ARTICLE IV   

   PERFORMANCE AWARDS   

4.1                                    ESTABLISHMENT
OF PERFORMANCE GOALS.  Performance Goals
applicable to a Performance Award shall be established by the Plan Committee in
its absolute discretion on or before the Date of Grant and not more than a
reasonable period of time after the beginning of the relevant Performance
Period.  Such Performance Goals may
include or be based upon any of the following criteria: pretax operating
contribution; economic value added; consolidated profits of the Company
expressed as a percent; earnings per share; return on capital; return on
investment; return on shareholders  equity;  

6  

revenue; working capital; pre-tax segment profit; sales volume; return
on sales; comparable store sales; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; return on assets; cash
flow; gross margin rate; expense rate; market price; and total shareholder
return.  Performance Goals may be
absolute in their terms or be measured against or in relationship to other
companies comparably, similarly or otherwise situated. The Plan Committee, in
its sole discretion, may modify the Performance Goals if it determines that
circumstances have changed and modification is required to reflect the original
intent of the Performance Goals; provided, however, that no such change or
modification may be made to the extent it increases the amount of compensation
payable to any Participant who is a  covered employee  within the meaning of
Code Section 162(m). The Plan Committee may in its discretion classify
Participants into as many groups as it determines, and as to any Participant
relate his/her Performance Goals partially, or entirely, to the measured
performance, either absolutely or relatively, of an identified Subsidiary,
operating company or test strategy or new venture of the Company.  

4.2                                    LEVELS
OF PERFORMANCE REQUIRED TO EARN PERFORMANCE AWARDS.     At or about the same
time that Performance Goals are established for a specific period, the Plan
Committee shall in its absolute discretion establish the percentage of the
Performance Awards granted for such Performance Period which shall be earned by
the Participant for various levels of performance measured in relation to
achievement of Performance Goals for such Performance Period. 

4.3                                    OTHER
RESTRICTIONS.  The Plan Committee shall
determine the terms and conditions applicable to any Performance Award, which
may include restrictions on the delivery of Common Stock payable in connection
with the Performance Award and restrictions that could result in the future
forfeiture of all or part of any Common Stock earned. The Plan Committee may
provide that shares of Common Stock issued in connection with a Performance
Award be held in escrow and/or legended. 

4.4                                    NOTIFICATION TO PARTICIPANTS.  Promptly after the Plan Committee has
established or modified the Performance Goals with respect to a Performance
Award, the Participant shall be provided with written notice of the Performance
Goals so established or modified. 

4.5                                    MEASUREMENT
OF PERFORMANCE AGAINST PERFORMANCE GOALS. 
The Plan Committee shall, as soon as practicable after the close of a
Performance Period, determine: 

(a)                                     the extent to which
the Performance Goals for such Performance Period have been achieved; and 

(b)                                    the percentage of the
Performance Awards earned as a result. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent the applicable
Performance Award agreement permits, the Plan Committee may, in its sole
discretion, reduce the percentage   

7  

of any Performance Award otherwise determined for a Performance Period,
and such reduced percentage shall be the amount earned by the Participant. All
determinations of the Plan Committee shall be absolute and final as to the
facts and conclusions therein made and be binding on all parties. Promptly
after the Plan Committee has made the foregoing determination, each Participant
who has earned Performance Awards shall be notified, in writing thereof. For
all purposes of this Plan, notice shall be deemed to have been given the date
action is taken by the Plan Committee making the determination.  Participants may not sell, transfer, pledge,
exchange, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of their
Performance Awards during the Performance Period, except that Performance
Awards may be transferable by assignment by a Participant to the extent
provided in the applicable Performance Award agreement.  

4.6                                    TREATMENT
OF PERFORMANCE AWARDS EARNED.  Upon the
Plan Committee s determination that a percentage of any Performance Awards have
been earned for a Performance Period, Participants to whom such earned
Performance Awards have been granted and who have been (or were) in the employ
of the Company or a Subsidiary thereof continuously from the Date of Grant,
subject to the exceptions set forth at Section 4.9 and Section 4.10
hereof, shall be entitled, subject to the other conditions of this Plan, to
payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of their Performance
Awards.  Such terms and conditions may
permit or require that any applicable tax withholding be deducted from the
amount payable.  Performance Awards shall
under no circumstances become earned or have any value whatsoever for any Participant
who is not in the employ of the Company or its Subsidiaries continuously during
the entire Performance Period for which such Performance Award was granted,
except as provided at Section 4.9 or Section 4.10 hereof. 

4.7                                    DISTRIBUTION.  Distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.6
above shall be made as soon as practicable after the Plan Committee determines
the Performance Awards have been earned unless the provisions of Section 4.8
hereof are applicable to a Participant. 

4.8                                    DEFERRAL
OF RECEIPT OF PERFORMANCE AWARD DISTRIBUTIONS. 
With the consent of the Plan Committee, a Participant who has been
granted a Performance Award may by compliance with the then applicable
procedures under the Plan irrevocably elect in writing to defer receipt of all
or any part of any distribution associated with that Performance Award.  The terms and conditions of any such
deferral, including but not limited to, the period of time for, and form of,
election; the manner and method of payout; the plan and form in which the
deferred amount shall be held; the interest equivalent or other payment that
shall accrue pending its payout; and the use and form of Dividend Equivalents
in respect of stock-based units resulting from such deferral, shall be as
determined by the Plan Committee.  The
Plan Committee may, at any time and from time to time, but prospectively only,
amend, modify, change, suspend or cancel any and all of the rights, procedures,
mechanics and timing parameters relating to such deferrals. An election made
prior to December 31, 2008 to defer receipt of any distribution associated
with a Performance Award relating to Performance Periods ending after December 31,
2004 is subject to the provisions of Appendix A. 

8  

4.9                                    NON-DISQUALIFYING
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  Except for Section 4.10
hereof, the only exceptions to the requirement of continuous employment during
a Performance Period for Performance Award distribution are termination of a
Participant s employment by reason of death (in which event the Performance
Award may be transferable by will or the laws of descent and distribution only
to such Participant s beneficiary designated to receive the Performance Award
or to the Participant s applicable legal representatives, heirs or legatees),
total and permanent disability, with the consent of the Plan Committee, normal
or late retirement or early retirement, with the consent of the Plan Committee,
or transfer of an executive in a spin-off, with the consent of the Plan
Committee, occurring during the Performance Period applicable to the subject
Performance Award. In such instance a distribution of the Performance Award
shall be made at the end of the Performance Period, and the percentage of the
total Performance Award that would have been earned during the Performance
Period shall be earned and paid out; provided, however, in a spin-off situation
the Plan Committee may set additional conditions, such as, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, continuous employment with the spin-off entity. If
a Participant s termination of employment does not meet the criteria set forth
above, but the Participant had at least 15 years of employment with the Company
or a Subsidiary or any combination thereof, the Plan Committee may allow
distribution of the percentage (or a portion thereof) of the total Performance
Award that is earned for the Performance Period, subject to any conditions that
the Plan Committee shall determine. 

4.10                              CHANGE
IN CONTROL.  In the event of a Change in
Control, the Performance Period shall be deemed to have ended and a pro rata
portion of all outstanding Performance Awards under the Plan shall be deemed to
have been earned. Specifically, the pro rata amount earned shall be determined
by multiplying 100% of each Performance Award by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of months that have elapsed in the applicable
Performance Period prior to the Change in Control and the denominator of which
shall be the total number of months in the Performance Period. Distribution of
the amount deemed earned shall be made within ten days after the Change in
Control or later if so provided in the applicable Award agreement, a related
deferral election or, if applicable, Appendix A.

(a)                                      Option Period .  Each
Stock Option shall expire and all rights to purchase shares thereunder shall
cease not more than ten years after its Date of Grant or on such date prior
thereto as may be fixed by the Plan Committee, or on such other date as is
provided by this Plan in the event of termination of employment, death or
reorganization.  No Stock Option shall
permit the purchase of any shares thereunder during the first year after its
Date of Grant, except as provided in Section 5.5 hereof or as otherwise determined
by the Plan Committee. 

(b)                                     Exercise Price .  The
purchase price per share payable upon exercise of a Stock Option shall not be
less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Date of Grant
of the Stock Option. 

(c)                                      Transferability and Termination of Options . 
During the lifetime of an individual to whom a Stock Option is granted,
the Stock Option may be exercised only by such individual and only while such
individual is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary and only if the Participant
has been continuously so employed by any one or combination thereof since the
Date of Grant of the Stock Option, provided, however, that if the employment of
such Participant by the Company or a Subsidiary Corporation terminates, the
Stock Option may additionally be exercised as follows, or in any other manner
provided by the Plan Committee, but in no event later than ten years after the
Date of Grant of the Stock Option, except as set forth in (ii) and (v) below: 

10  

(i)                                        If a Participant s termination of employment
occurs by reason of normal or late retirement under any retirement plan of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, such Participant s Stock Options may be exercised
within five years after the date of such termination of employment.  If a Participant s termination of employment
occurs by reason of early retirement under any retirement plan of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or by reason of the transfer of a Participant in a
spin-off, or by reason of total and permanent disability, as determined by the
Plan Committee, without retirement, then such Participant s Stock Options shall
be exercisable for a period of up to five years after the date of such
termination of employment if the Plan Committee consents to such an
extension.  During the extension period,
the right to exercise Stock Options, if any, accruing in installments, shall
continue unless the Plan Committee provides otherwise; provided, however, that
if the Stock Options are Incentive Stock Options all installments shall be
immediately exercisable; and provided further, that the Plan Committee may set
additional conditions, such as, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, an agreement to not provide services to a competitor of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and/or continuous employment with a spin-off entity. 

(ii)                                     If a Participant s
termination of employment occurs by reason of death, then such Participant s
outstanding Stock Options shall all become immediately exercisable and may be
exercised within five years after the date of death or the life of the option,
whichever is less, but in the case of Non-Qualified Options in no event less
than one year after the date of death, unless the Plan Committee provides
otherwise. 

(iii)                                  If a Participant s termination
of employment occurs for any reason other than as specified in Section 5.3(c)(i) or
(ii) hereof, the Participant has been employed by the Company or a
Subsidiary or any combination for more than 15 years, and if the Plan Committee
so approves, then such Participant s Stock Options may be exercised within a
period of up to five years after the date of termination of employment.  During the extension period, the right to
exercise options, if any, accruing in installments shall continue unless the Plan
Committee provides otherwise; provided, however, the Plan Committee may set
additional conditions. 

(iv)                                 If a Participant s
termination of employment occurs for any reason other than as specified in Section 5.3(c)(i) or
(ii) hereof and the Plan Committee has not approved an extension, then,
except as provided below and only with respect to installments that have as  

11  

of the date of termination already accrued, such Participant s Stock
Options may be exercised within ninety days after the date of such termination
of employment except in the case of Participants who would at the time be
subject to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, in
which instance the period of exercise shall be two hundred ten days after
termination.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, those Participants whose employment is terminated because of
deliberate and serious disloyal or dishonest conduct in the course of
employment that justifies and results in prompt discharge for specific cause
under the established policies and practices of the Company as interpreted by
the Plan Committee shall have no additional period after termination of
employment in which to exercise their options. Examples of such deliberate and
serious disloyal or dishonest conduct would include material unlawful conduct,
material and conscious falsification or unauthorized disclosure of important
records, embezzlement or unauthorized conversion of property, serious violation
of conflict of interest or vendor relations policies, and misuse or disclosure
of significant trade secrets or other information likely to be of use to the
detriment of the Company or its interests.  

(v)                                    Rights accruing to a
Participant under Sections 5.3(c)(i), 5.3(c)(iii) and 5.3(c)(iv) may,
upon the death of a Participant subsequent to his/her termination of
employment, be exercised by his/her duly designated beneficiary or otherwise by
his/her applicable legal representatives, heirs or legatees to the extent
vested in and unexercised or perfected by the Participant at the date of
his/her death.  In the case of
Non-Qualified Options, the period for such exercise shall not expire less than
one year after the date of the Participant s death, unless the Plan Committee
provides otherwise. 

(vi)                                 Absence on a leave of
absence approved by the Plan Committee shall not be deemed a termination or
interruption of continuous employment for the purposes of the Plan. 

No Stock Option shall be assignable or transferable by the individual
to whom it is granted, except that it may be transferable (X) by
assignment by the Participant to the extent provided in the applicable option
agreement (or as subsequently allowed by the Plan Committee), or (Y) by
will or the laws of descent and distribution in accordance with the provisions
of this Plan.  Upon the death of the
Participant an option may only be exercised by such individual s beneficiary
designated to exercise the option or otherwise by his/her applicable legal
representatives, heirs or legatees, and only within the specific time period
set forth above and only to the extent vested in and unexercised by the
Participant at the date of his/her death, except as provided in Section 5.3(c)(ii).  

12  

In no event, whether by the Participant directly or by his/her proper
assignee or beneficiary or other representative, shall any option be
exercisable at any time after its expiration date as stated in the option
agreement, except as provided in Section 5.3(c)(ii) and (v).  When an option is no longer exercisable it
shall be deemed for all purposes and without further act to have lapsed and
terminated.  The Plan Committee may, in
its sole discretion, determine solely for the purposes of the Plan that a
Participant is permanently and totally disabled, and the acts and decisions of
the Plan Committee made in good faith in relation to any such determination
shall be conclusive upon all persons and interests affected thereby.  

(d)                                     Exercise of Options .  An
individual entitled to exercise Stock Options may, subject to their terms and
conditions and the terms and conditions of the Plan, exercise them in whole or
in part by delivery of written notice of exercise to the Company at its
principal office or such other manner as the Company may direct, specifying the
number of whole shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Options
are being exercised.  Before shares may
be issued, payment must be made in full, in legal United States tender, in the
amount of the purchase price of the shares to be purchased at the time and any
amounts for withholding as provided in Section 10.8 hereof; provided,
however, in lieu of paying for the exercise price in cash as described above,
the individual may pay (subject to such conditions and procedures as the Plan
Committee may establish) all or part of such exercise price by tendering
(either actually or by attestation) owned and unencumbered shares of Common
Stock acceptable to the Plan Committee and having a Fair Market Value on the
date of exercise of the Stock Options equal to or less than the exercise price
of the Stock Options exercised, with cash, as set forth above, for the
remainder, if any, of the purchase price; provided, further, that the Plan
Committee may permit a Participant to elect to pay the exercise price by
authorizing a third party to sell shares of Common Stock (or a sufficient
portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Stock Options and remit to
the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire
exercise price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise.  Subject to rules established by the Plan
Committee, the withholdings required by Section 10.8 hereof may be
satisfied by the Company withholding shares of Common Stock issued on exercise
that have a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Stock Options
equal to or less than the withholding required by Section 10.8 hereof. 

(e)                                      Repricing
Prohibited .  Subject to Sections 5.5,
7.3 and 10.7, outstanding Stock Options granted under this Plan shall not be
repriced. 

13  

5.4                                    STOCK APPRECIATION
RIGHTS.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be
granted to Participants either alone ( freestanding ) or in tandem with other
Awards, including Performance Awards, Stock Options and Restricted Stock.  Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem
with Incentive Stock Options must be granted at the same time as the Incentive
Stock Options are granted.  Stock
Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with any other Award may be granted at
any time prior to the earlier of the exercise or expiration of such Award.  Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem
with Stock Options shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the
termination or exercise of the related Stock Options.  The Plan Committee shall establish the terms
and conditions applicable to any Stock Appreciation Rights, which terms and
conditions need not be uniform but may not be inconsistent with the terms of
the Plan.  Freestanding Stock
Appreciation Rights shall generally be subject to terms and conditions
substantially similar to those described in Section 5.3 for Stock Options,
including the requirements of 5.3(a), (b) and (e) regarding the
maximum period, minimum price and prohibition on repricing. 

5.5                                    CHANGE IN
CONTROL.  In the event of a Change in
Control: 

(a)                                     If the Company is the
surviving entity and any adjustments necessary to preserve the value of the
Participant s outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have been
made, or the Company s successor at the time of the Change in Control
irrevocably assumes the Company s obligations under this Plan or replaces the
Participant s outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights with
stock options and stock appreciation rights having substantially the same value
and having terms and conditions no less favorable to the Participant than those
applicable to the Participant s Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
immediately prior to the Change in Control (collectively, an  Equitable
Assumption or Replacement ), then such Awards or their replacement awards shall
become immediately exercisable in full only if within two years after the
Change in Control the Participant s employment: 

(i)                                        is terminated without  Cause , which for
purposes of this Section 5.5 shall mean (x) willful and continued
failure to substantially perform the Participant s duties (other than failure
resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after receipt of a
written demand for such performance specifically identifying such failure, or (y) the
willful engaging by the Participant in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that
is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company or its successor; 

(ii)                                     terminates with  Good Reason , which for
purposes of this Section 5.5 shall mean any material diminution of the
Participant s position, authority, duties or responsibilities (including the
assignment of duties materially inconsistent with the Participant s position or
a material increase in the time Participant is required by the Company or its
successor to travel), any reduction in salary or in the Participant s aggregate
bonus and incentive opportunities, any material reduction in the aggregate
value of the Participant s employee benefits (including  

14  

retirement, welfare and fringe benefits), or relocation to a principal
work site that is more than 40 miles from the Participant s principal work site
immediately prior to the Change in Control; or  

(iii)                                  terminates under circumstances that entitle
the Participant to accelerated exercisability under any individual employment
agreement between the Participant and the Company, a Subsidiary, or any
successor thereof. 

(b)                                    If there is no
Equitable Assumption or Replacement, then without any action by the Plan
Committee or the Board, each outstanding Stock Option and Stock Appreciation
Right granted under the Plan that has not been previously exercised or
otherwise lapsed and terminated shall become immediately exercisable in full;
provided, however, that the Plan Committee, in its sole discretion, and without
the consent of any Participant affected thereby, may determine that a cash
payment shall be made promptly following the Change in Control in lieu of all
or any portion of the outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
granted under this Plan.  The amount
payable with respect to each share of Common Stock subject to an affected Stock
Option and each affected Stock Appreciation Right shall equal the excess of the
Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Change
in Control over the exercise price of such Stock Option or Stock Appreciation
Right.  After such a determination by the
Plan Committee, each Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right, with respect to
which a cash payment is to be made shall terminate, and the Participant shall
have no further rights thereunder except the right to receive such cash
payment. 

ARTICLE VI   

   RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS   

6.1                                    RESTRICTION
PERIOD.  At the time an Award of
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units is made, the Plan Committee shall
establish the terms and conditions applicable to such Award, including the
period of time (the  Restriction Period ) during which certain restrictions
established by the Plan Committee shall apply to the Award.  The Restriction Period shall not be less than
three years, provided, however, that for Awards to non-employee directors of
the Company, the terms of the Award may allow for the ratable release of the
restrictions over a minimum period of one year. Each such Award, and designated
portions of the same Award, may have a different Restriction Period, at the
discretion of the Plan Committee. Except as permitted or pursuant to Sections
6.4, 6.5 or 10.7 hereof, the Restriction Period applicable to a particular
Award shall not be changed. 

6.2                                    RESTRICTED STOCK TERMS
AND CONDITIONS.  Restricted Stock shall
be represented by a stock certificate registered in the name of the Participant
granted  

15  

such Restricted Stock.  Such
Participant shall have the right to enjoy all shareholder rights during the
Restriction Period except that:  

(a)                                     The Participant shall
not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate until the Restriction
Period shall have expired. 

(b)                                    The Company may either issue shares subject
to such restrictive legends and/or stop-transfer instructions as it deems
appropriate or provide for retention of custody of the Common Stock during the
Restriction Period. 

(c)                                     The Participant may
not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the
Common Stock during the Restriction Period, except that it may be transferable
by assignment by the Participant to the extent provided in the applicable
Restricted Stock Award agreement. 

(d)                                    A breach of the terms
and conditions established by the Plan Committee with respect to the Restricted
Stock shall cause a forfeiture of the Restricted Stock, and any dividends
withheld thereon. 

(e)                                     Dividends payable in
cash or in shares of stock or otherwise may be either currently paid or
withheld by the Company for the Participant s account.  At the discretion of the Plan Committee,
interest may be paid on the amount of cash dividends withheld, including cash
dividends on stock dividends, at a rate and subject to such terms as determined
by the Plan Committee. 

Provided, however, and the provisions of Section 6.4 to the
contrary notwithstanding, in lieu of the foregoing, the Plan Committee may
provide that no shares of Common Stock be issued until the Restriction Period
is over and further provide that the shares of Common Stock issued after the
Restriction Period has been completed, be issued in escrow and/or be legended
and that the Common Stock be subject to restrictions including the forfeiture
of all or a part of the shares.  

6.3                                    PAYMENT FOR RESTRICTED
STOCK.  A Participant shall not be
required to make any payment for Restricted Stock unless the Plan Committee so
requires. 

6.4                                    FORFEITURE
PROVISIONS.  Subject to Section 6.5,
in the event a Participant terminates employment during a Restriction Period
for the Participant s Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, such Awards
will be forfeited; provided, however, that the Plan Committee may provide for
proration or full payout in the event of (a) a termination of employment
because of normal or late retirement, (b) with the consent of the Plan
Committee, early retirement or spin-off, (c) death, (d) total and  

16  

permanent disability, as determined by the Plan Committee, (e) with
the consent of the Plan Committee, termination of employment after 15 years of
employment with the Company or a Subsidiary or any combination thereof, or (f) in
the case of a non-employee director, a departure from the Board following the
completion of the director s term of office, all subject to any other
conditions the Plan Committee may determine. Any Restricted Stock Unit that is
not, in all cases, due and payable not later than the 15  th  day of the third month following the calendar
year, or if later, the Company s fiscal year, in which the Restricted Stock
Unit ceases to be subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture  within the
meaning Section 409A of the Code, will be subject to the provisions of
Appendix A. 

6.5                                    CHANGE
IN CONTROL.  In the event of a Change in
Control, restrictions on a fraction of each Participant s outstanding
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan will
lapse.  The numerator of such fraction
with respect to an Award shall be the number of months that have elapsed in the
applicable Restriction Period prior to the Change in Control and the denominator
shall be the number of months in such Restriction Period. Distribution of any
shares not previously distributed shall be made within ten days after the
Change in Control or later if so provided in the applicable Award agreement, a
related deferral election or if applicable, Appendix A. 

6.6                                    DEFERRAL
OF RECEIPT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. 
With the consent of the Plan Committee, a Participant who has been
granted a Restricted Stock Unit may by compliance with the then applicable
procedures under the Plan irrevocably elect in writing to defer receipt of all
or any part of any distribution associated with that Award.  The terms and conditions of any such
deferral, including but not limited to, the period of time for, and form of,
election; the manner and method of payout; the plan and form in which the
deferred amount shall be held; the interest equivalent or other payment that
shall accrue pending its payout; and the use and form of Dividend Equivalents
in respect of stock-based units resulting from such deferral, shall be as
determined by the Plan Committee.  The
Plan Committee may, at any time and from time to time, but prospectively only,
amend, modify, change, suspend or cancel any and all of the rights, procedures,
mechanics and timing parameters relating to such deferrals. An election made
prior to December 31, 2008 to defer receipt of any distribution associated
with a Restricted Stock Unit relating to a Restriction Period ending after December 31,
2004 is subject to the provisions of Appendix A. 

ARTICLE VII   

   SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; MAXIMUM
AWARDS   

7.1                                    SHARES
AVAILABLE.  Subject to the other
provisions of this Article VII, the total number of shares available for
grant as Awards pursuant to the Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate
81,000,000 shares of Common Stock.  (This
limit includes the 44,000,000 shares that were originally made available under
this Plan.)  Solely for the purpose of
applying the limitation in the preceding sentence and subject to the
replenishment and adjustment provisions of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 below: 

17  

(a)                                     each
Award granted under this Plan prior to May 19, 2004 (the date the Plan was
last approved by shareholders) shall reduce the number of shares available for
grant by one share for every one share granted; 

(b)                                    each
Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under this Plan on or after May 19,
2004 shall reduce the number of shares available for grant by one share for
every one share granted; 

(c)                                     each Award granted under this Plan on or
after May 19, 2004 that may result in the issuance of Common Stock, other
than a Stock Option, Stock Appreciation Right, or Dividend Equivalent, shall
reduce the number of shares available for grant by two shares for every one
share granted; 

(d)                                    each Dividend Equivalent that the Corporation
has determined may result in the issuance of Common Stock shall reduce the
number of shares available for grant by two shares for every share that would
be issuable if the accumulated value of the Dividend Equivalent were converted
into Common Stock at Fair Market Value, but such reduction shall only occur if
the corresponding dividends payable to shareholders were paid in cash; and 

(e)                                     if Awards are granted in tandem, so that only
one of the Awards may actually be exercised, only the Award that results in the
greater reduction in the number of shares available for grant shall result in a
reduction of the shares so available, and the other Award shall be disregarded. 

Shares available for grant under the Plan may
be authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares held by the Company or
shares purchased or held by the Company or a Subsidiary for purposes of the
Plan, or any combination thereof.  Shares
issued upon assumption or conversion of outstanding stock-based awards granted
by an acquired company shall be disregarded in applying the limitation set
forth in this Section 7.1.  

7.2                                    SHARES
AGAIN AVAILABLE.  In the event all or any
portion of an Award is forfeited or cancelled, expires, is settled for cash, or
otherwise does not result in the issuance of all or a portion of the shares
subject to the Award in connection with the exercise or settlement of such
Award, the number of shares not issued that were deducted for such Award
pursuant to Section 7.1 above shall be restored and may again be used for
Awards under the Plan. If a Participant uses shares of Common Stock to pay a
purchase or exercise price or tax withholding, either by having the Company
withhold shares or tendering shares (either actually or by attestation), an equal
number of such shares shall be restored and may again be used for Awards under
the Plan.  In addition, shares may be
reacquired on the open market by the Company using the Cash Proceeds received
by the Company from the exercise on or after May 19, 2004 of Stock Options
granted under the Plan to restore an equal number of shares that may again be
used for Awards under the Plan; provided, however, that the number of shares so
restored does not exceed the  

18  

number that could be purchased at Fair Market Value with the Cash
Proceeds on the date of exercise of the Stock Option giving rise to such Cash
Proceeds.  

If one of the events described in the first sentence of the preceding
paragraph occurs with respect to an award that was granted under a Prior Plan
(as defined in Section 10.11) but was outstanding on May 19, 2004,
the total number of shares available for grant under this Plan shall be
increased by one share for each share subject to that award that is not issued.  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary and
solely for purposes of determining whether shares are available for the
issuance of Incentive Stock Options, the maximum aggregate number of shares
that may be granted under this Plan shall be determined without regard to any
shares restored pursuant to this Section 7.2 that, if taken into account,
would cause the Plan to fail the requirement under Code Section 422 that
the Plan designate the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued.  

7.3                                    RELEVANT
CHANGE ADJUSTMENTS.     In the event of any equity restructuring
(within the meaning of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004)) other than: (1) any distribution of securities or other property by
the Company to shareholders in a spin-off or split-up that does not qualify as
a tax-free spin-off or split-up under Section 355 of the Code (or any
successor provision of the Code); or (2) any cash dividend (including
extraordinary cash dividends), appropriate adjustments in the number of shares
available for grant and in any outstanding Awards, including adjustments in the
size of the Award and in the exercise price per share of Stock Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be made by the Plan Committee to give effect
to such equity restructuring to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits
or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. No such
adjustment shall be required to reflect the events described in clauses (1) and
(2) above, or any other change in capitalization that does not constitute
an equity restructuring, however such adjustment may be made: (x) if
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, the adjustment
qualifies as a substitution or assumption under Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1;
and (y) the Plan Committee affirmatively determines, in its discretion,
that such an adjustment is appropriate. 

7.4                                    MAXIMUM
PER PARTICIPANT AWARD.  During any
consecutive thirty-six month period, no Participant may receive Awards that, in
the aggregate, could result in that Participant receiving, earning or
acquiring, subject to the adjustments described in Section 7.3: 

(a)                                     Stock Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights for, in the aggregate, more than 4,000,000 shares of
Common Stock; 

  (b)                                    Performance Shares,
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units for, in the aggregate, more than
700,000 shares of Common Stock; 

  (c)                                     A number of Dividend
Equivalents greater than the number of shares of Common Stock the Participant
could receive, earn or acquire in  

19  

connection with the related stock-based Awards granted to the
Participant; and  

  (d)                                    Performance Units with
a value exceeding $15,000,000. 

In addition, during any consecutive thirty-six month period, no
Participant who is a non-employee director may receive Awards that, in the
aggregate, could result in that Participant receiving, earning or acquiring,
subject to the adjustments described in Section 7.3, more than 75,000
shares of Common Stock.  For purposes of
applying the limits described in this Section 7.4, if Awards subject to
the same limit are granted in tandem, so that only one of the Awards may
actually be exercised, only one of the Awards shall be counted.  

ARTICLE VIII   

   ADMINISTRATION   

8.1                                    PLAN COMMITTEE.  The Plan will be administered by a committee
of two or more members of the Compensation Committee of the Board who are
appointed from time to time by the Board and who are outside, independent Board
members who, in the judgment of the Board, are qualified to administer the Plan
as contemplated by (a) Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 (or any successor rule), (b) Section 162(m) of the Code,
as amended, and the regulations thereunder (or any successor Section and
regulations), and (c) any rules and regulations of a stock exchange
on which Common Stock is traded.  Any
member of the committee administering the Plan who does not satisfy or ceases
to satisfy the qualifications set out in the preceding sentence may recuse himself
or herself from any vote or other action taken by such committee.  The Board may, at any time and in its
complete discretion, remove any member of such committee and may fill any
vacancy on such committee. 

8.2                                    POWERS.  The Plan Committee shall have and exercise
all of the powers and responsibilities granted expressly or by implication to
it by the provisions of the Plan. 
Subject to and as limited by such provisions, the Plan Committee may
from time to time enact, amend and rescind such rules, regulations and
procedures with respect to the administration of the Plan as it deems
appropriate or convenient. 

8.3                                    INTERPRETATION.  All questions arising under the Plan, any
Award agreement, or any rule, regulation or procedure adopted by the Plan
Committee shall be determined by the Plan Committee, and its determination
thereof shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties. 

8.4                                    COMMITTEE
PROCEDURE.  Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the Plan Committee under the Plan shall require the
affirmative vote of a majority of a quorum of the members of the Plan
Committee.  A majority of all members of
the Plan Committee shall constitute a  quorum  for Plan Committee business. The
Plan Committee may act by written determination instead of by affirmative vote
at a meeting, provided that any written determination shall be signed by all
members of the  

20  

Plan Committee, and any such written determination shall be as fully
effective as a majority vote of a quorum at a meeting.  

8.5               DELEGATION.  The Plan Committee may delegate all or any
part of its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee of directors and/or
officers of the Company for purposes of determining and administering Awards
granted to persons who are not then subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16
of the Exchange Act.  

ARTICLE IX   

   REDUCTION IN AWARDS   

9.1                 WHEN
APPLICABLE.  Anything in this Plan to the
contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this Article IX shall apply to
a Participant if an independent auditor selected by the Plan Committee (the  Auditor )
determines that each of (a) and (b) below are applicable.  

(a)               Payments or distributions
hereunder, determined without application of this Article IX, either alone
or together with other payments in the nature of compensation to the
Participant which are contingent on a change in the ownership or effective
control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the
assets of the Company, or otherwise (but after any elimination or reduction of
such payments under the terms of the Company s Officer Income Continuance
Policy Statement, as amended), would result in any portion of the payments
hereunder being subject to an excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed
under Section 4999 of the Code.  

(b)               The excise tax imposed on the Participant under Section 4999
of the Code on excess parachute payments, from whatever source, would result in
a lesser net aggregate present value of payments and distributions to the
Participant (after subtraction of the excise tax) than if payments and
distributions to the Participant were reduced to the maximum amount that could
be made without incurring the excise tax.  

9.2               REDUCED AMOUNT.  Under this Article IX the payments and
distributions under this Plan shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the
present value of such payments and distributions shall equal the Reduced
Amount. The  Reduced Amount  (which may be zero) shall be an amount expressed
in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of payments and
distributions under this Plan which can be made without causing any such
payment to be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.
The determinations and reductions under this Section 9.2 shall be made
after eliminations or reductions, if any, have been made under the Company s
Officer Income Continuance Policy Statement, as amended.  

21  

9.3               PROCEDURE.  If the Auditor determines that this Article IX
is applicable to a Participant, it shall so advise the Plan Committee in
writing. The Plan Committee shall then promptly give the Participant notice to
that effect together with a copy of the detailed calculation supporting such
determination which shall include a statement of the Reduced Amount. Such
notice shall also include a description of which and how much of the Awards
shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as their aggregate present value equals
the Reduced Amount). For purposes of this Article IX, Awards shall be
reduced in the following order: (1) Stock Options with an exercise price
above the then Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock that have a
positive value for purposes of Section 280G of the Code, as determined
under applicable IRS guidance; (2) pro rata among Awards that constitute
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code; and (3) if
a further reduction is necessary to reach the Reduced Amount, among the Awards
that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code. Present value shall be
determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code. All the foregoing
determinations made by the Auditor under this Article IX shall be made as
promptly as practicable after it is determined that excess parachute payments
(as defined in Section 280G of the Code) will be made to the Participant
if an elimination or reduction is not made. As promptly as practicable, the
Company shall provide to or for the benefit of the Participant such amounts and
shares as are then due to the Participant under this Plan and shall promptly
provide to or for the benefit of the Participant in the future such amounts and
shares as become due to the Participant under this Plan.  

9.4               CORRECTIONS.  As a result of the uncertainty in the
application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial
determination by the Auditor hereunder, it is possible that payments or
distributions under this Plan will have been made which should not have been
made ( Overpayment ) or that additional payments or distributions which will
have not been made could have been made ( Underpayment ), in each case,
consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event
that the Auditor, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal
Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant which the Auditor
believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has
been made, any such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to
the Participant which the Participant shall repay together with interest at the
applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the
Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by the Participant if
and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to
the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the
Auditor, based upon controlling precedent, determines that an Underpayment has
occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid to or for the benefit of
the Participant together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided
for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.  

9.5               NON-CASH
BENEFITS.  In making its determination under
this Article IX, the value of any non-cash benefit shall be determined by
the Auditor in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) of
the Code.  

22  

9.6               DETERMINATIONS
BINDING.  All determinations made by the
Auditor under this Article IX shall be binding upon the Company, the Plan
Committee and the Participant.  

ARTICLE X   

   GENERAL PROVISIONS   

10.1             AMENDMENT OR
TERMINATION OF PLAN.    The Board may at any time amend,
suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan (including the making of any
necessary enabling, conforming and procedural amendments to the Plan to
authorize and implement the granting of Incentive Stock Options or other income
tax preferred stock options which may be authorized by federal law subsequent
to the effective date of this Plan); provided, however, that no amendment by
the Board shall, without further approval of the shareholders of the Company,
increase the total number of shares of Common Stock which may be made subject
to the Plan, except as provided at Section 7.3 hereof, or make any other
change for which shareholder approval is required by law or under the
applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange.  No action taken pursuant to this Section 10.1
of the Plan shall, without the consent of the Participant, adversely affect any
Awards which have been previously granted to a Participant except pursuant to Section 10.5
of the Plan.  

10.2             NON-ALIENATION
OF RIGHTS AND BENEFITS.  Except as
expressly provided herein, no right or benefit under the Plan shall be subject
to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge
and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or
charge the same shall be void. No right or benefit hereunder shall in any
manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts
of the person entitled to such right or benefit. If any Participant or
beneficiary hereunder should become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate,
alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any right or benefit
hereunder (other than as expressly provided herein), then such right or benefit
shall, in the sole discretion of the Plan Committee, cease and in such event
the Company may hold or apply the same or any or no part thereof for the
benefit of the Participant or beneficiary, his/her spouse, children or other
dependents or any of them in any such manner and in such proportion as the Plan
Committee in its sole discretion may deem proper.  

10.3             NO RIGHTS AS
SHAREHOLDER.  The granting of Awards
under the Plan shall not entitle a Participant or any other person succeeding
to his/her rights, to any dividend, voting or other right as a shareholder of
the Company unless and until the issuance of a stock certificate to the Participant
or such other person pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and then only
subsequent to the date of issuance thereof.  

10.4             LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY. 
As illustrative only of the limitations of liability or obligation of
the Company and not intended to be exhaustive thereof, nothing in the Plan
shall be construed:  

23  

(a)               to give any employee of the
Company any right to be granted any Award other than at the sole discretion of
the Plan Committee;  

(b)               to give any Participant any rights whatsoever with
respect to shares of Common Stock except as specifically provided in the Plan;  

(c)               to limit in any way the right of the Company or any
Subsidiary to terminate, change or modify, with or without cause, the
employment of any Participant at any time; or  

(d)               to be evidence of any agreement or understanding,
express or implied, that the Company or any Subsidiary will employ any
Participant in any particular position at any particular rate of compensation
or for any particular period of time.  

Payments and other benefits received by a Participant under an Award
shall not be deemed part of a Participant s regular, recurring compensation for
purposes of any termination, indemnity or severance pay laws and shall not be
included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of benefits under any
other employee benefit plan, contract or similar arrangement provided by the
Company or any Subsidiary, unless expressly so provided by such other plan,
contract or arrangement or the Plan Committee determines that an Award or
portion of an Award should be included to reflect competitive compensation
practices or to recognize that an Award has been made in lieu of a portion of
competitive cash compensation.  

10.5             GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS.  Notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Plan seemingly to the contrary, the obligation of the Company
with respect to Awards granted under the Plan shall at all times be subject to
any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations and such approvals by
any government agencies as may be required or deemed by the Board or Plan
Committee as reasonably necessary or appropriate for the protection of the
Company.  

In connection with any sale, issuance or transfer hereunder, the
Participant acquiring the shares shall, if requested by the Company, give
assurances satisfactory to counsel of the Company that the shares are being
acquired for investment and not with a view to resale or distribution thereof
and assurances in respect of such other matters as the Company may deem
desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal requirements.  

10.6             NON-EXCLUSIVITY
OF THE PLAN.  Neither the adoption of the
Plan by the Board nor the submission of the Plan to shareholders of the Company
for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power or
authority of the Board to adopt such other or additional incentive or other
compensation arrangements of whatever nature as the Board may deem necessary or
desirable or preclude or limit the continuation of any other plan, practice or
arrangement for the payment of compensation or fringe benefits to employees
generally, or to any class or group of employees, which the   

24  

Company
or any Subsidiary now has lawfully put into effect, including, without
limitation, any retirement, pension, savings, profit sharing or stock purchase
plan, insurance, death and disability benefits, and executive short term
incentive plans.  

10.7             REORGANIZATION.  In case the Company is merged or consolidated
with another corporation, or in case the property or stock of the Company is
acquired by another corporation, or in case of a separation, reorganization or
liquidation of the Company (for purposes hereof any such occurrence being
referred to as an  Event ), the Plan Committee or a comparable committee of any
corporation assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder, shall either:  

(a)               make
appropriate provision for the protection of any outstanding stock-based Awards
granted thereunder by the substitution on an equitable basis of appropriate
stock, stock units, stock options or stock appreciation rights of the Company,
or of the merged, consolidated or otherwise reorganized corporation which will
be issuable in respect to the Awards. 
Stock to be issued pursuant to such substitute awards shall be limited
so that the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to
such substitute awards immediately after such substitution over the purchase
price thereof (if any) is not more than the excess of the aggregate fair market
value of the shares subject to such substitute awards immediately before such
substitution over the purchase price thereof (if any); or  

(b)               upon written notice to the Participant, declare that
all Performance Awards granted to the Participant are deemed earned, that the
Restriction Period of all Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units has been
eliminated and that all outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
shall accelerate and become exercisable in full but that all outstanding Stock
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, whether or not exercisable prior to such
acceleration, must be exercised within the period of time set forth in such notice
or they will terminate.  In connection
with any declaration pursuant to this Section 10.7(b), the Plan Committee
may, but shall not be obligated to, cause a cash payment to be made to each
Participant who holds a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right that is
terminated in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
amount (if any) by which the Event Proceeds Per Share (as hereinafter defined)
exceeds the exercise price per share covered by such Stock Option times (y) the
number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Stock Option or Stock
Appreciation Right.  For purposes of this
Section 10.7(b),  Event Proceeds Per Share  shall mean the cash plus the
fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Plan Committee, of the
non-cash consideration to be received per share by the shareholders of the
Company upon the occurrence of the Event.  

10.8             WITHHOLDING TAXES, ETC.     All
distributions under the Plan shall be subject to any required withholding taxes
and other withholdings and, in case of   

25  

distributions in Common Stock, the Participant or other recipient may,
as a condition precedent to the delivery of Common Stock, be required to pay to
his/her participating employer the excess, if any, of the amount of required
withholding over the withholdings, if any, from any distributions in cash under
the Plan.  All or a portion of such
payment may, in the discretion of the Plan Committee and upon the election of
the Participant, be made (a) by withholding from shares that would
otherwise be delivered to the Participant a number of shares sufficient to
satisfy the remaining required tax withholding or (b) by tendering (either
actually or by attestation) owned and unencumbered shares of Common Stock
acceptable to the Plan Committee and having a Fair Market Value on the date of
tender equal to or less than the remaining required tax withholding.  No distribution under the Plan shall be made
in fractional shares of Common Stock, but the proportional market value thereof
shall be paid in cash.  

10.9             GENERAL
RESTRICTION.  Each Award shall be subject
to the requirement that, if at any time the Board shall determine, in its
discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares subject
to such option and/or right upon any securities exchange or under any state or
federal law, or the consent or approval of any government regulatory body, is
necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with the granting of
such Award or the issue or purchase of shares respectively thereunder, such
Award may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing,
registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or
obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Board.  

10.10           USE OF
PROCEEDS.  The proceeds derived by the
Company from the sale of the stock pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan
shall constitute general funds of the Company.  

10.11           PRIOR
PLANS.  Notwithstanding the adoption of
this Plan by the Board, the Company s Executive Long Term Incentive Plan of
1981 and the Director Stock Option Plan of 1995, as the same have been amended
from time to time (the  Prior Plans ), shall remain in effect, and all grants
and awards heretofore made under the Prior Plans shall be governed by the terms
of the Prior Plans. The Plan Committee shall not, however, make any additional
grants pursuant to the Prior Plans.  

10.12           DURATION OF
PLAN.  This Plan shall remain in effect
until the earliest of the following events occurs: (a) distribution of all
shares of Common Stock subject to the Plan, (b) termination of this Plan
pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, or (c) May 19, 2014; provided,
however, that Awards made before the termination or expiration of this Plan may
be exercised, vested, settled or otherwise effectuated after such date in
accordance with the terms of such Awards.  

10.13           SEVERABILITY.  In the event any provision of this Plan shall
be held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity
shall not affect the remaining parts of this Plan, and this Plan shall be
construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been
included.  

26  

10.14           GOVERNING
LAW.  To the extent that federal laws do
not otherwise control, this Plan and all determinations made and actions taken
pursuant to this Plan shall be governed by the laws of Minnesota and construed
accordingly.  

10.15           HEADINGS.  The headings of the Articles and their
subparts in this Plan are for convenience of reading only and are not meant to
be of substantive significance and shall not add to or detract from the meaning
of such Article or subpart to which it refers.  

10.16           STOCK
CERTIFICATES.  Notwithstanding anything
in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent the Plan provides for the issuance
of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock or
Restricted Stock, the issuance may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to
the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any
stock exchange on which the Common Stock is traded.  

27  

APPENDIX A   

A-1              PURPOSE AND
EFFECT   . This Appendix A to the Target Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan
modifies the terms of any deferred Performance Award and any Restricted Stock
Unit that is subject to Section 409A of the Code that was awarded prior to
December 31, 2008 and that is paid or payable after December 31, 2008.
The provisions of this Appendix A will supersede any inconsistent terms of any
award that is covered by this Appendix A. Awards covered by this Appendix A
(collectively referred to herein as  Appendix A Awards ) include:  

(a)       Any Performance Award
deferred prior to December 31, 2008 for a Performance Period ending
after December 31, 2004 ( Deferred Performance Share Unit   

(b)       Any Restricted Stock Unit
(other than a Deferred Restricted Stock Unit defined below) for which
distribution is not, in all cases, due and payable not later than the 15  th   day of the third month following the calendar
year, or if later, the Company s fiscal year, in which the Restricted Stock
Unit ceases to be subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture  within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and  

(c)       Any Restricted Stock Unit
relating to a Restriction Period ending after December 31, 2004 for
which an election was made prior to December 31, 2008 to defer
receipt of any distribution associated with such Restricted Stock Unit ( Deferred
Restricted Stock Unit ).  

A-2              DEFINITIONS   . The
capitalized terms in this Addendum that are not defined below, shall have the
same meaning as in the Agreement, or, if not defined in the Agreement, as
defined in the Plan.  

(a)        Company   . For purposes
of this Addendum, Company includes any person that would be treated as a single
employer with the Company under Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the
Code.  

(b)        Disabled   . An employee
Participant will be Disabled if, by reason of any medically-determinable
physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can
be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months,
Participant (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity or
(ii) is receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less
than three months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the
Company. An employee Participant will be deemed to be Disabled if he or she is
determined to be totally disabled by the Social Security Administration.  

(c)        Termination of Employment   . For purposes
of determining an employee Participant s entitlement to payment of an Appendix
A Award,  Termination   

28  

of Employment  means a severance of such Participant s employment
relationship with the Company, for any reason. For purposes of determining when
a distribution will be made under Appendix A, a  Termination of Employment 
will be deemed to occur if, based on the relevant facts and circumstances to
the Participant, the Company and Participant reasonably anticipate that future
services to be performed by the Participant for the Company will permanently
decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of services performed over
the immediately preceding 36-month period. A bona fide leave of absence that is
six months or less, or during which an individual retains a reemployment right,
will not cause a Termination of Employment. In the case of a leave of absence
without a right of reemployment that exceeds the time periods described in this
paragraph, a Termination of Employment will be deemed to occur once the leave
of absence exceeds six months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Termination of
Employment shall not occur unless such termination also qualifies as a  separation
from service,  as defined under Section 409A of the Code and related
guidance thereunder.  

(d)        Trust   . Trust means
the Target Corporation Deferred Compensation Trust, established by agreement
dated January 1, 2005, by and between the Company and State Street Bank
and Trust Company, as amended, or similar trust agreement.  

A-3               PAYMENT OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANT S RESTRICTED
STOCK UNITS   . The
vested amount of an employee Participant s Restricted Stock Units and Deferred
Restricted Stock Units shall convert to shares of Common Stock and shall be
issued to or on behalf of the Participant upon the earlier of the following:  

(a)       the employee Participant s
death;  

(b)       the date the employee
Participant becomes Disabled;  

(c)       for a Participant s Deferred Restricted
Stock Units, the later of the Vesting Date or the first day of the month next
following the date that is six (6) months after the employee Participant s
Termination of Employment; and for a Participant s Restricted Stock Units that
are not Deferred Restricted Stock Units, the earlier of the Vesting Date or the
first day of the month next following the date that is six (6) months
after the employee Participant s Termination of Employment; or  

(d)       the termination and liquidation of
employee Participant s Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Restricted Stock
Units under Section A-7 below.  

Payments under Paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) will be made within 90 days of such distribution event and payment on
account of Paragraph (d) will be made in accordance with Section A-7.  

29  

A-4              PAYMENT OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR
PARTICIPANT S RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS   . The vested amount of a non-employee director
Participant s Restricted Stock Units shall convert to shares of Common Stock
and shall be issued to or on behalf of the Participant upon the earlier of the
following:  

(a) the
date of the Participant s death; or  

(b) the
date the non-employee director Participant ceases to be a member of the Board
of Directors of the Company, provided the Participant has ceased all
contractual relationships as an independent contractor with the Company and has
experienced a  separation from service  under Section 409A of the Code,
provided further, if the Participant is a  specified employee,  as defined
under Section 409A of the Code, on the date of his or her separation from
service, payment will be suspended for six (6) months following the
Participant s separation from service, or, if earlier, until the Participant s
death.  

A-5              PAYMENT OF DEFERRED PERFORMANCE AWARD   . 
The vested amount of the percentage of a Participant s Deferred
Performance Share Units shall convert to shares of Common Stock and shall be
issued to or on behalf of a Participant as soon as practicable, but not more
than 90 days, after the later of the following:  

(a) the
end of the Performance Period; or  

(b) the
first of the following events to occur:  

(1)               the Participant s death;  

  (2)               the date the Participant becomes
Disabled;  

  (3)               the first day of the month next following
the date that is six (6) months after the Participant s Termination of
Employment;  

  (4)               the fixed distribution date, if any,
designated by the Participant pursuant to a written distribution election made
in accordance with Plan procedures; or  

  (5)               the termination and liquidation of the
Participant s Deferred Performance Share units under Section A-7 below.  

A-6               FUNDING UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL   . In the event a Change in Control causes the
Trust to be funded, the Company shall:  

(a)               determine the amount of the Company s
obligation to Participants who are entitled to a distribution of Appendix A
Awards, by multiplying the number of Units earned as of the Change in Control
by the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of the Change
in Control;  

(b)               credit the amounts determined in
paragraph (a) to a bookkeeping account in the name of each applicable
Participant;  

30  

(c)               on and after the date of the Change in
Control, credit to such bookkeeping accounts investment earnings at an annual
rate equal to the sum of the 10-Year United States Treasury Note rate plus
2%.  The 10-Year United States Treasury
Note rate will be determined on the date of the Change in Control, or if no
such rate is available on that date, the immediately preceding date such rate
is available, and such rate will be reset each calendar quarter as necessary;
and  

(d)               transfer cash or other property to the
Trust as provided under the Trust.  Such
transfer shall be made to the extent permitted by, subject to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the Trust.  

A-7               AWARD TERMINATION AND LIQUIDATION ON ACCOUNT
OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL   .  Upon a Change in Control the Appendix A
Awards will terminate and payment of all amounts under such Awards will be
accelerated if and to the extent provided in this Section A-7.  

(a)       The Appendix A Awards will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change in Control under Section 2.4(a) and (ii) a funding of the
Trust on account of such Change in Control (referred to herein as the  Appendix

SECTION 1 
INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1                                      History.   The
Company originally established this Plan (formerly known as the Target
Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan I) effective as of January 1,
1995.  The Plan is a non-qualified,
unfunded plan intended to replace certain pension benefits for a select group
of management or highly compensated employees who are officers.  The Plan provides retirement benefits not
provided under the Pension Plan as a result of the limitations imposed by Code
sections 401(a)(17) and 415.   The Plan
is intended to be a  top hat plan  as defined under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time.   Since the effective date of this Plan, upon
a Participant becoming an Officer of the Company, the benefit due under the
Target Corporation SPP IV has been transferred to this Plan.  Effective April 30, 2002, for
Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating
Committee, the Company transferred the present value of the vested benefit due
under this Plan to the Officer EDCP. 
Effective July 31, 2002, this transfer was extended to all Officers
of the Company.  After such transfer, no
benefits were due or payable to the Participant from this Plan. Further, after
the transfer, the individuals would no longer participate in this Plan or be
eligible for further accruals under this Plan. 
Effective January 1, 2005 (and other effective dates as specifically
provided), this Plan was operated in compliance with Code section 409A.  This Plan Statement, which is intended to
comply with Code section 409A, is effective January 1, 2009.

the Officer EDCP as provided below. 

6.2.1                            Timing of Benefit Transfer.  

(a)                                   On or about the April 30 (or the
immediately preceding business day) immediately following the calendar year in
which a Participant is first eligible to participate in this Plan and has a
vested benefit, a Participant will have his or her vested benefit that is
determined under this Plan transferred to the Officer EDCP.  The transfer will be an amount equal to the
actuarial lump sum present value on March 31 (or the immediately preceding
business day) for the Participant s SPP Benefit accrued through the preceding December 31.  In the case of a Participant who is an
executive officer, such transfer will be made and determined on or about the
last business day prior to the end of the Company s fiscal year. 

(b)                                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of
a Termination of Employment as defined under Section 1.2.19(a) or a
Plan termination upon a Change-in-Control under Section 8.3.2 prior to the
date in Section 6.2.1(a), the transfer will be made within 60 days
following such event. 

6.2.2                            Benefit to Be Transferred.   The benefit transferred to the Officer EDCP is the vested benefit
accrued and determined under this Plan at the time of transfer to the Officer
EDCP provided in Section 6.2.1.  The
transfer to the Officer EDCP will not change the payment form, payment timing,
or vested status of the benefit determined under this Plan.  After the transfer to the Officer EDCP, the
benefit will be subject to the terms of the Officer EDCP, including the
acceleration or delay of distributions permitted thereunder.

SECTION 7 
NATURE OF INTEREST   

7.1                                      Unfunded Obligation.   The
obligation of the Participating Employers to provide benefits pursuant to this
Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the
Participating Employers to provide such benefits.  Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs,
successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims or
interests in any specific property or assets of the Company or a Participating
Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or
interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds
therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company. 

7.2                                      Spendthrift Provision.  
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2, no Participant or
Beneficiary shall have any interest in any benefit which can be transferred nor
shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate,
dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of
the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator
shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under this
Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan
shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or
other legal process before actual payment to such person.  This Section 7.2 shall not prevent the
Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable
powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof. 

11  

SECTION 8   

   ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

8.1                                      Adoption.   With the prior approval of the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may
adopt the Plan and become a Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan
Administrator a certified copy of a resolution of its board of directors
adopting the Plan. 

8.2                                      Amendment.  

8.2.1                            General Rule.   The Board may at any time amend this Plan, in whole or in part, for any
reason, including but not limited to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a
result of which may be to terminate this Plan; provided, unless such amendment
is necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, no amendment
shall be effective to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable
under this Plan to any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits
thereafter accruing) prior to the date of such amendment.  The Committee is authorized to make any
amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or desirable by the
Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan provided such
amendment does not have a material financial impact on the Company.  Such changes will be considered an Amendment
to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the Board.  Written notice of any amendment shall be
given to each Participant then participating in this Plan. 

8.2.2                            Amendment to Benefit of Executive
Officer.   Any amendment to the benefit of an executive
officer under this Plan, to the extent approval of such amendment by the board
of directors would be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
its regulations or the rules of any applicable securities exchange, will
require the approval of the Board. 

8.2.3                            No Oral Amendments.   No modification of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective
unless it is in writing.  No oral
representation concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement
shall be effective to amend this Plan Statement. 

8.3                                      Termination.  

8.3.1                            General Rule.  

(a)                                     To the extent necessary or reasonable to
comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any time terminate this Plan,
provided such termination satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A. 

(b)                                    To the extent that a Participant s benefit
under the Plan will be immediately included in the income of the Participant,
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Internal Revenue
Service, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A, the Board may
terminate this Plan,    in whole or in
part, as it relates to the impacted Participant. 

8.3.2                            Plan Termination on Account of a
Change-in-Control.   Upon a Change-in-Control the Plan will
terminate and the transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if
and to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2. 

(a)                                     The Plan will be terminated effective as of
the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a Change-in-Control
under Section 1.2.5(a), and (ii) a funding of the Trust on account of
such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the 

12  

Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan
termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan
will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to
have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination
effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not
terminate as of such date.  

(b)                                    The determination by the Board under
paragraph (a) constitutes a determination that such termination will
satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A, including an agreement by the
Company that it will take such additional action or refrain from taking such
action as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements necessary to terminate
and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below. 

(c)                                     In the event the Board does not affirmatively
determine not to terminate the Plan as provided in paragraph (a), such
termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows: 

(i)                                        If the Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change
in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, transfer of all amounts
under the Plan will be accelerated and distributed under the Officer EDCP. 

(ii)                                     If the Change-in-Control does not    qualify as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
distributed under the Officer EDCP.

modified by the Plan Administrator, the claim and review procedures set forth
in this Section shall be the mandatory claim and review procedures for the
resolution of disputes and disposition of claims filed under the Plan.  An application for a distribution or
withdrawal shall be considered as a claim for the purposes of this Section. 

9.1.1                           Initial Claim.   An individual may, subject to any applicable deadline, file with the

the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant of the adverse benefit
determination within ninety (90) days after receipt of the claim. 

(b)                                   The ninety (90) day period for making the
claim determination may be extended for ninety (90) days if the Plan
Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of
time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan Administrator
notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial ninety (90) day
period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and the date by
which a claim determination is expected to be made. 

9.1.2                           Notice of Initial Adverse
Determination.   A notice of an adverse determination shall
set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant: 

(a)                                    the specific reasons for the adverse

after receipt of an initial adverse benefit determination notice, the claimant
may file with the Plan Administrator a written request for a review of the
adverse determination and may, in connection therewith submit written comments,
documents, records and other information relating to the claim benefits.  Any request for review of the initial adverse
determination not filed within sixty (60) days after receipt of the initial
adverse determination notice shall be untimely. 

9.1.4                           Claim on Review.   If the claim, upon review, is denied in whole or in part, the Plan
Administrator shall notify the claimant of the adverse benefit determination
within sixty (60) days after receipt of such a request for review. 

14  

(a)                                    The sixty (60) day period for deciding the

determination of the claim, provided that the Plan Administrator notifies the
claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial sixty (60) day period, of the
special circumstances requiring an extension and the date by which a claim
determination is expected to be made. 

(b)                                   In the event that the time period is extended
due to a claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim
on review, the claimant shall have sixty (60) days within which to provide the
necessary information and the period for making the claim determination on
review shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension
is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the
request for additional information or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60)
days. 

(c)                                    The Plan Administrator s review of a denied

determination.

(a)                                    No inquiry or question shall be deemed to be
a claim or a request for a review of a denied claim unless made in accordance
with the established claim procedures. 
The Plan Administrator may require that any claim for benefits and any
request for a review of a denied claim be filed on forms to be furnished by the
Plan Administrator upon request. 

(b)                                   All decisions on claims and on requests for a
review of denied claims shall be made by the Plan Administrator unless
delegated as provided for in the Plan, in which case references in this Section 9
to the Plan Administrator shall be treated as references to the Plan
Administrator s delegate. 

(c)                                    Claimants may be represented by a lawyer or
other representative at their own expense, but the Plan Administrator reserves
the right to require the claimant to furnish written authorization and
establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been
authorized to act on behalf of a claimant. 
A claimant s representative shall be entitled to copies of all notices
given to the claimant. 

(d)                                    The decision of the Plan Administrator on a
claim and on a request for a review of a denied claim may be provided to the

Administrator. 

(e)                                    In connection with the review of a denied
claim, the claimant or the claimant s representative shall be provided, upon

(f)                                      The time period within which a benefit
determination will be made shall begin to run at the time a claim or request
for review is filed in accordance with the claims procedures, without regard to
whether all the information necessary to make a benefit determination
accompanies the filing. 

(g)                                   The claims and review procedures shall be
administered with appropriate safeguards so that benefit claim determinations
are made in accordance with governing plan documents and, where appropriate,
the plan provisions have been applied consistently with respect to similarly
situated claimants. 

(h)                                   The Plan Administrator may, in its
discretion, rely on any applicable statute of limitation or deadline as a basis

9.3.1                           Claims.   No claim shall be considered under these
administrative procedures unless it is filed with the Plan Administrator within

of the dispute giving rise to the claim. 
Every untimely claim shall be denied by the Plan Administrator without
regard to the merits of the claim.  

9.3.2                           Lawsuits.   No suit may be brought by or on behalf of any

earlier of: 

(a)                                    the date the Participant knew (or reasonably
should have known) of the general nature of the dispute giving rise to the
action, or 

(b)                                   the date the claim was denied. 

9.3.3                           Exhaustion of Remedies.   These administrative procedures are the
exclusive means for resolving any dispute arising under this Plan.  As to such matters: 

(a)                                    no Participant or Beneficiary shall be
permitted to litigate any such matter unless a timely claim has been filed
under these administrative procedures and these administrative procedures have
been exhausted, and 

(b)                                   determinations by the Plan Administrator
(including determinations as to whether the claim was timely filed) shall be
afforded the maximum deference permitted by law. 

9.3.4                           Imputed Knowledge.   For the purpose of applying the deadlines to
file a claim or a legal action, knowledge of all facts that a Participant knew
or reasonably should have known shall be imputed to every claimant who is or
claims to be a Beneficiary of the Participant or otherwise claims to derive an
entitlement by reference to the Participant for the purpose of applying the
previously specified periods.

SECTION 1   

   INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1                                      History.   The
Company originally established this Plan (formerly known as the Target
Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan II) effective as of January 1,
1995.  The Plan is a non-qualified,
unfunded plan intended to replace certain pension benefits for a select group
of management or highly compensated employees who are officers that cannot be
provided under the Pension Plan due to certain limitations imposed by the
Code.  The Plan provides retirement
benefits not provided under the Pension Plan as a result of deferrals into the
Officer EDCP.  The Plan is intended to be
a  top hat plan  as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended from time to time. 
Since the effective date of this Plan, upon a Participant becoming an
Officer of the Company, the benefit due under the Target Corporation SPP V is
transferred to this Plan.  Effective April 30,
2002, for all Officers who were vested in the benefit under this Plan, the
Company transferred the present value of the vested benefit due under this Plan
to the Officer EDCP.  After such
transfer, no benefits were due or payable from this Plan. Further, after the
transfer, the individuals would no longer participate in this Plan or be
eligible for further accruals under this Plan.  
Effective January 1, 2005 (and other effective dates as
specifically provided), this Plan was operated in compliance with Code section
409A.  This Plan Statement, which is
intended to comply with Code section 409A, is effective January 1, 2009.

Transfer to Officer EDCP.     No
benefits transferred to this Plan from SPP V or benefits accrued and determined
under this Plan will be paid directly to Participants.  All vested benefits due under this Plan, as

Officer EDCP, and paid to the Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to the terms
of the Officer EDCP.  

6.1.2                             Form and
Timing of Benefit Distribution.     Benefits earned under this Plan will be
deemed to have a distribution form and timing of an Actuarial Equivalent single
lump payment    of the vested benefit determined
under Sections 3 and 4, as applicable, within 60 days following the one-year
anniversary of the date that the Participant incurs a Termination of
Employment.  Any benefits earned under
this Plan will be subject to the distribution terms of the Officer EDCP,
including any provisions regarding the acceleration or delay of distribution
(to the extent allowed under Code section 409A).  

6.1.3                             Transfers
from SPP V.     Benefits
transferred to this Plan from SPP V will have the distribution timing, form,

acceleration or delay of distribution (to the extent allowed under Code section
409A).  

6.2                                       Transfers
to Officer EDCP.      A Participant s
vested benefit under this Plan will be transferred to the Officer EDCP as

April 30 (or the immediately preceding business day) immediately following
the calendar year in which a Participant is first eligible to participate in
this Plan and has a vested benefit, a Participant will have his or her vested
benefit that is determined under this Plan transferred to the Officer
EDCP.  The transfer will be an amount
equal to the actuarial lump sum present value on March 31 (or the
immediately preceding business day) for the Participant s SPP Benefit accrued
through the preceding December 31. 
In the case of a Participant who is an executive officer, such transfer
will be made and determined on or about the last business day prior to the end
of the Company s fiscal year.  

(b)                                     Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the case of a Termination of Employment as defined under Section 1.2.19(a) or
a Plan termination upon a Change-in-Control under Section 8.3.2 prior to
the date in Section 6.2.1(a), the transfer will be made within 60 days
following such event.  

6.2.2                             Benefit
to Be Transferred.     The benefit
transferred to the Officer EDCP is the vested benefit accrued and determined
under this Plan at the time of transfer to the Officer EDCP provided in Section 6.2.1.  The transfer to the Officer EDCP will not
change the payment form, payment timing, or vested status of the benefit
determined under this Plan.  After the
transfer to the Officer EDCP, the benefit will be subject to the terms of the
Officer EDCP, including the acceleration or delay of distributions permitted
thereunder.

SECTION 7   

   NATURE OF INTEREST   

7.1              Unfunded Obligation.     The obligation of the Participating Employers
to provide benefits pursuant to this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but
legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to provide such
benefits.  Participants and their
Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable
rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company
or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any
rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts
or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company.  

7.2              Spendthrift Provision.     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2,
no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any benefit which can
be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to
anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the
possession or control of the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator shall not recognize
any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan shall be
subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other
legal process before actual payment to such person.  This Section 7.2 shall not prevent the
Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable
powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof.

   ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

8.1                                       Adoption.     With the prior
approval of the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may adopt the Plan and become
a Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan Administrator a certified
copy of a resolution of its board of directors adopting the Plan.  

8.2                                       Amendment.

Rule.     The Board may at any time
amend this Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited
to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate
this Plan; provided, unless such amendment is necessary or reasonable to comply
with any changes in law, no amendment shall be effective to decrease the
benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under this Plan to any Participant
with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the
date of such amendment.  The Committee is
authorized to make any amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or
desirable by the Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan
provided such amendment does not have a material financial impact on the
Company.  Such changes will be considered
an Amendment to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the
Board.  Written notice of any amendment
shall be given to each Participant then participating in this Plan.  

8.2.2                             Amendment
to Benefit of Executive Officer.     Any amendment
to the benefit of an executive officer under this Plan, to the extent approval
of such amendment by the board of directors would be required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board.  

8.2.3                             No Oral
Amendments.     No modification
of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in
writing.  No oral representation
concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be
effective to amend this Plan Statement.  

8.3                                       Termination.   

8.3.1                             General
Rule.   

(a)                                      To the extent
necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any
time terminate this Plan, provided such termination satisfies the requirements
of Code section 409A.  

(b)                                     To the extent
that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the
income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section
409A, the Board may terminate this Plan,    in whole or in
part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.  

8.3.2                             Plan
Termination on Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control the Plan will
terminate and the transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if
and to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2.  

(a)                                      The Plan will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.5(a), and (ii) a funding   

14  

of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein
as the  Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan
termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan
will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to
have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination
effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not
terminate as of such date.  

(b)                                     The
determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination
that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A,
including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action
or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.  

(c)                                      In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as
provided in paragraph (a), such termination shall be subject to either (i) or
(ii), as follows:  

(i)                                         If the
Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
distributed under the Officer EDCP.  

(ii)                                      If the
Change-in-Control does not    qualify as a  change
in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, transfer of all amounts
under the Plan will be accelerated and distributed under the Officer EDCP.

the adverse benefit determination within ninety (90) days after receipt of the
claim.  

(b)                                     The ninety (90)
day period for making the claim determination may be extended for ninety (90)
days if the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an
extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial

initial adverse benefit determination notice, the claimant may file with the
Plan Administrator a written request for a review of the adverse determination
and may, in connection therewith submit written comments, documents, records
and other information relating to the claim benefits.  Any request for review of the initial adverse
determination not filed within sixty (60) days after receipt of the initial
adverse determination notice shall be untimely.  

9.1.4           Claim on Review.     If the claim,
upon review, is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify
the claimant of the adverse benefit determination within sixty (60) days after

information necessary to decide a claim on review, the claimant shall have
sixty (60) days within which to provide the necessary information and the
period for making the claim determination on review shall be tolled from the
date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until
the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional
information or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60) days.

(a)                                      No inquiry or
question shall be deemed to be a claim or a request for a review of a denied
claim unless made in accordance with the established claim procedures.  The Plan Administrator may require that any
claim for benefits and any request for a review of a denied claim be filed on
forms to be furnished by the Plan Administrator upon request.  

(b)                                     All decisions
on claims and on requests for a review of denied claims shall be made by the
Plan Administrator unless delegated as provided for in the Plan, in which case
references in this Section 9 to the Plan Administrator shall be treated as
references to the Plan Administrator s delegate.  

(c)                                      Claimants may
be represented by a lawyer or other representative at their own expense, but

whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant.  A claimant s representative shall be entitled
to copies of all notices given to the claimant.

the Plan Administrator on a claim and on a request for a review of a denied claim

discretion of the Plan Administrator.  

(e)                                      In connection
with the review of a denied claim, the claimant or the claimant s

within which a benefit determination will be made shall begin to run at the
time a claim or request for review is filed in accordance with the claims
procedures, without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a
benefit determination accompanies the filing.  

(g)                                     The claims and
review procedures shall be administered with appropriate safeguards so that
benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan
documents and, where appropriate, the plan provisions have been applied
consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.  

(h)                                     The Plan
Administrator may, in its discretion, rely on any applicable statute of

9.3.1       Claims.     No claim shall be considered
under these administrative procedures unless it is filed with the Plan
Administrator within two (2) years after the Participant knew (or   

18  

reasonably should have known) of the general nature
of the dispute giving rise to the claim. 
Every untimely claim shall be denied by the Plan Administrator without
regard to the merits of the claim.  

9.3.2           Lawsuits.     No suit may be brought by or on behalf of any
Participant or Beneficiary on any matter pertaining to this Plan unless the
action is commenced in the proper forum within two (2) years from the
earlier of:  

(a)                                      the date the
Participant knew (or reasonably should have known) of the general nature of the
dispute giving rise to the action, or  

(b)                                     the date the
claim was denied.  

9.3.3       Exhaustion
of Remedies.     These administrative procedures are the
exclusive means for resolving any dispute arising under this Plan.  As to such matters:  

(a)                                      no Participant
or Beneficiary shall be permitted to litigate any such matter unless a timely
claim has been filed under these administrative procedures and these
administrative procedures have been exhausted, and  

(b)                                     determinations
by the Plan Administrator (including determinations as to whether the claim was
timely filed) shall be afforded the maximum deference permitted by law.  

9.3.4       Imputed
Knowledge.     For the purpose of applying the deadlines to
file a claim or a legal action, knowledge of all facts that a Participant knew
or reasonably should have known shall be imputed to every claimant who is or
claims to be a Beneficiary of the Participant or otherwise claims to derive an
entitlement by reference to the Participant for the purpose of applying the
previously specified periods.

SECTION 1 
INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1          History.     The Company originally established this Plan
(formerly known as the Target Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan III)
effective as of January 1, 1995. 
The Plan is a non-qualified, unfunded plan intended to provide certain
pension benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees who are officers that cannot be provided under the Pension Plan due
to certain limitations imposed by the Code. 
The Plan is intended to be a  top hat plan  as defined under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to
time.   Effective as of November 8,
2000, no additional Officers could become eligible to participate in this
Plan.  Effective April 30, 2002, for
all Officers who had attained age 55, the Company transferred the present value
of the vested benefit due under this Plan to the Officer EDCP.  After such transfer, no benefits were due or
payable from this Plan. Further, after the transfer, the individuals would no
longer participate in this Plan or be eligible for further accruals under this
Plan.  Effective January 1, 2005
(and other effective dates as specifically provided), this Plan was operated in
compliance with Code section 409A.  This
Plan Statement, which is intended to comply with Code section 409A, is
effective January 1, 2009.

year in which a Participant is first eligible for a benefit under this Plan, a

to the Officer EDCP is the vested benefit accrued under this Plan and
determined at the time of transfer to the Officer EDCP provided in Section 5.2.1.  The transfer to the Officer EDCP will not
change the payment form, payment timing, or vested status of the benefit
determined under this Plan.  After the
transfer to the Officer EDCP, the benefit will thereafter be subject to the
terms of the Officer EDCP, including the acceleration or delay of distributions
permitted thereunder.

SECTION 6 
NATURE OF INTEREST   

6.1                                    Unfunded Obligation.   The obligation of the Participating Employers
to provide benefits pursuant to this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but
legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to provide such
benefits.  Participants and their
Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable
rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company
or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any
rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts
or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company. 

6.2                                    Spendthrift Provision.   Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.2,
no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any benefit which can
be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to
anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the
possession or control of the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator shall not recognize
any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan shall be
subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other
legal process before actual payment to such person.  This Section 6.2 shall not prevent the
Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable
powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof.

may adopt the Plan and become a Participating Employer by furnishing to the
Plan Administrator a certified copy of a resolution of its board of directors
adopting the Plan. 

7.2                                      Amendment.

reason, including but not limited to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a
result of which may be to terminate this Plan; provided, unless such amendment
is necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, no amendment
shall be effective to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable
under this Plan to any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits
thereafter accruing) prior to the date of such amendment.  The Committee is authorized to make any
amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or desirable by the

the approval of the Board. 

7.2.3                            No Oral Amendments.   No modification of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective
unless it is in writing.  No oral

7.3                                      Termination.  

7.3.1                            General Rule.  

(a)                                   To the extent necessary or reasonable to
comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any time terminate this Plan,
provided such termination satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A. 

(b)                                  To the extent that a Participant s benefit
under the Plan will be immediately included in the income of the Participant,
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Internal Revenue
Service, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A, the Board may
terminate this Plan,    in whole or in
part, as it relates to the impacted Participant. 

7.3.2                            Plan Termination on Account of a
Change-in-Control.   Upon a Change-in-Control the Plan will
terminate and the transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if
and to the extent provided in this Section 7.3.2. 

(a)                                   The Plan will be terminated effective as of
the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a Change-in-Control
under Section 1.2.5(a), and (ii) a funding  

11  

of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein
as the  Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan
termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan
will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to
have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination
effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not
terminate as of such date.  

(b)                                    The determination by the Board under
paragraph (a) constitutes a determination that such termination will
satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A, including an agreement by the
Company that it will take such additional action or refrain from taking such
action as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements necessary to terminate
and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below. 

(c)                                     In the event the Board does not affirmatively
determine not to terminate the Plan as provided in paragraph (a), such
termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows: 

(i)                                       If the Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change
in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, transfer of all amounts
under the Plan will be accelerated and distributed under the Officer EDCP. 

(ii)                                    If the Change-in-Control does not    qualify as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, transfer of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
distributed under the Officer EDCP.

extension of time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan
Administrator notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial
ninety (90) day period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and
the date by which a claim determination is expected to be made.  

8.1.2           Notice of Initial Adverse Determination.     A notice of an adverse determination shall

initial adverse benefit determination notice, the claimant may file with the
Plan Administrator a written request for a review of the adverse determination
and may, in connection therewith submit written comments, documents, records
and other information relating to the claim benefits.  Any request for review of the initial adverse
determination not filed within sixty (60) days after receipt of the initial
adverse determination notice shall be untimely.  

8.1.4           Claim on Review.     If the claim,
upon review, is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify
the claimant of the adverse benefit determination within sixty (60) days after
receipt of such a request for review.

information necessary to decide a claim on review, the claimant shall have
sixty (60) days within which to provide the necessary information and the
period for making the claim determination on review shall be tolled from the
date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until
the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional
information or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60) days.

(a)                                      No inquiry or
question shall be deemed to be a claim or a request for a review of a denied
claim unless made in accordance with the established claim procedures.  The Plan Administrator may require that any
claim for benefits and any request for a review of a denied claim be filed on
forms to be furnished by the Plan Administrator upon request.

(f)                                        The time period
within which a benefit determination will be made shall begin to run at the
time a claim or request for review is filed in accordance with the claims
procedures, without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a
benefit determination accompanies the filing.  

(g)                                     The claims and
review procedures shall be administered with appropriate safeguards so that
benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan

of the dispute giving rise to the claim. 
Every untimely claim shall be denied by the Plan Administrator without
regard to the merits of the claim.  

8.3.2                             Lawsuits.     No suit may be brought by or on behalf of any

claim was denied.  

8.3.3                             Exhaustion of Remedies.     These administrative procedures are the
exclusive means for resolving any dispute arising under this Plan.  As to such matters:  

(a)                                      no Participant
or Beneficiary shall be permitted to litigate any such matter unless a timely
claim has been filed under these administrative procedures and these
administrative procedures have been exhausted, and  

(b)                                     determinations

longer available, its successor index, or if no successor index exists, such
other index as selected by the Committee as most closely replicates the measure
produced by said Moody index) for the month of June for the year preceding
the subject Plan Year to which the Declared Rate shall apply, said rate of
return to be rounded to the nearest .10% of said reported rate, to which
percentage rate shall be added six (6) percentage points (e.g. an index of
7.16% rounded to 7.20%  plus 6% equals a
13.2%  Declared Rate ).   Provided
however , if any tax or insurance change shall occur which in the reasoned
judgment of the Committee shall have an ongoing adverse economic effect on the
underlying COLI financing assumptions related to the Plan, then the Committee
may adjust said Declared Rate to reflect such adverse economic impact but in no

hereof.

Specified Employee.    For
purposes of complying with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (relating
to the 6 month suspension of certain benefit distributions), an individual is a
 Specified Employee  if on his or her Termination of Employment, the Company or
other Affiliate has stock that is traded on an established securities market
within the meaning of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B) and such individual is a  key
employee  (defined below).  For this
purpose, an individual is a  key employee  during the 12-month period beginning
on April 1 immediately following the calendar year in which the individual
was employed by the Company and other Affiliates, and satisfied, at any time
within such calendar year, the requirements of Code section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii) or
(iii) (without regard to Code section 416(i)(5)).  An individual will not be treated as a
Specified Employee if the individual is not required to be treated as a

severance of a Participant s employment relationship with the Employer and all
other Affiliates, for any reason. 

(b)                                  For purposes of determining when a
distribution will be made under the Plan, a  Termination of Employment  will be
deemed to occur if, based on the relevant facts and circumstances to the
Participant, the Employer, all other Affiliates, and Participant reasonably
anticipate that the level of
bona fide future services to be
performed by the Participant for the Employer and all other Affiliates will
permanently decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36-month period. 

(c)                                   A bona fide leave of absence that is six
months or less, or during which an individual retains a reemployment right,
will not cause a Termination of Employment. 
In the case of a leave of absence without a right of reemployment that
exceeds the time periods described in this paragraph, a Termination of
Employment will be deemed to occur once the leave of absence exceeds six
months. 

(d)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Termination
of Employment shall not occur unless such termination also qualifies as a  separation
from service,  as defined under Code section 409A and related guidance
thereunder.

ARTICLE 3  

  ADMINISTRATION OF
THE PLAN  

A Committee shall be
appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to administer the Plan
and to establish, adopt or revise such rules and regulations as it may
deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.  The Committee shall have discretionary
authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of
the Plan.  Interpretations of the Plan by
the Committee shall be conclusive. 
Members of the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan
while serving as members of the Committee, but a member of the Committee shall
not vote or act upon any matter which relates solely to such member s interest
in the Plan as a Participant.

ARTICLE 4  

  PARTICIPATION  

4.1                                   Election
to Participate.   Effective for Plan
Years beginning on and after January 1, 1997, Participants ceased to be
eligible to defer Earnings into this Plan. 
For Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 1997, any Employee who
is a member of the Senior Management Group of the Company may enroll in the
Plan by filing a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement or
authorization form with the Committee. Pursuant to said Enrollment Agreement or
authorization form, the Employee shall irrevocably designate a dollar amount by
which the aggregate Earnings of such Participant would be reduced over one (1) or
four (4) Plan Years next following the execution of the Enrollment
Agreement (the  Benefit Deferral Period ), provided, however, that: 

(a)                                    Minimum
Deferral.   The reduction for any Plan
Year shall not be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) 

(b)                                   Reduction
in Earnings.  

(i)                                         In
General.   Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 4.1, the Earnings of the Participant for each of
the Plan Years in the Benefit Deferral Period shall be reduced by the amount
specified in the Enrollment Agreement (including any authorization form)
applicable to such Plan Year. 

(ii)                                      Accelerated
Reduction.   A Participant may elect
in a written notice with the consent of the Committee to increase the amount of
the reduction of Earnings otherwise provided for by Section 4.1(b)(i) for
any of the Plan Years remaining in the Benefit Deferral Period, provided,
however, that any such increase in the reduction of Earnings for any remaining
Plan Years in the Benefit Deferral Period shall not increase the Cumulative
Deferral Amount, but shall act to shorten the length of the Benefit Deferral
Period. 

(c)                                    Maximum
Reduction in Earnings.   A Participant
may not elect a Cumulative Deferral Amount or an increase in reduction of
Earnings pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(ii), or any combination of the two,
that would cause the aggregate total reduction in Earnings in any Plan Year to
exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the base pay and one hundred percent (100%)
of the incentive pay payable during such Plan Year up to a total of $250,000
per year plus the amount of any payout made pursuant to Section 5.4, or
such greater percent of base pay and/or incentive pay or greater total amount
as the Committee may permit in its sole discretion.  In the event that a Participant elects a
Cumulative Deferral Amount or increase in reduction of Earnings that would
violate the limitation described in this paragraph (c), the election shall be
valid except that the Cumulative Deferral Amount or increase in reduction of
Earnings so elected shall automatically be reduced to comply with such
limitation, whichever is most appropriate in the sole discretion of the
Committee. 

4.2                                   Deferral
Accounts.   The Committee shall
establish and maintain a separate Deferral Account for each Participant. The
amount by which a Participant s Earnings are reduced pursuant to Section 4.1
shall be credited by the Employer to the Participant s Deferral Account on the
fifteenth (15th) day of the month in which such Earnings would otherwise have
been paid.  The Participant s Deferral
Account shall be credited with the annual SRSP lost Matching Allocation on  

5  

January 15
following the year of the lost Matching Allocation.  Effective for Plan Years beginning on and
after January 1, 1997, Participants ceased to be eligible for the annual
SRSP lost Matching Allocation.  Such
Deferral Account shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the
Employer to the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary pursuant to this
Plan.  

(a)                                    Normal
and Early Retirement Interest.   Each
Deferral Account of a Participant who retires as a Normal or Early Retirement
shall be deemed to bear interest, in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1,
from the date such Deferral Account was established through the date of
commencement of payment of the Normal or Early Retirement Benefit at a rate
equal to the Declared Rate which is announced by the Committee for each Plan
Year.  Following the date of commencement
of payment of the Normal or Early Retirement Benefit, a Participant s Deferral
Account shall be deemed to bear interest on the balance of such Deferral
Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 2. 

(b)                                   Other
Interest.   In the case of any
Termination of Employment other than by Normal or Early Retirement or upon the
Participant s termination of enrollment in this Plan pursuant to Section 5.2(b),
the Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear interest from the
date such Deferral Account was established through the date of the earlier of
Termination of Employment or termination of enrollment in this Plan under Section 5.2(c) on
the balance in such Deferral Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1,
except that the interest rate used to calculate interest earned in the Deferral
Account shall be ten percent (10%) per annum, provided, however, that if more
than five (5) years have elapsed since the first day of the Benefit
Deferral Period, the Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear
interest from the date such Deferral Account was established through the date
of the earlier of Termination of Employment or termination of enrollment in
this Plan on the balance in such Deferral Account at a rate equal to the
Declared Rate which is announced by the Committee for each Plan Year, in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 1. 
Following the earlier of the date of commencement of payment of the
Termination Benefit or the date of termination of enrollment in this Plan, a
Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear interest on the balance
in such Deferral Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1, if the
Participant is in Active Status with respect to the Deferral Account or in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 2, if the Participant is in Pay Status
with respect to the Deferral Account. 
However, in either case the interest rate used to calculate interest
earned in the Deferral Account shall be twelve percent (12%) per annum.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, if a Participant has begun receiving benefits under this Plan and
the calculation of future benefits, using the method of calculation set forth
on Appendix A causes a reduction in benefits, the future payments shall be made
in accordance with the method used at the time of the Participant s initial
payment. 

4.3                                   Rollover
Deferred Compensation Account.   In
its sole discretion, the Committee may permit a Participant to make a special
rollover election to transfer any amounts which were previously deferred under
the Company s existing deferred compensation plans to this Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
special rollover elections or transfers to this Plan shall be permitted after December 31,
2008. 

In such event, the Committee shall establish and maintain a separate
Rollover Deferral Account for each Participant who makes a rollover transfer to
this Plan.  Such Rollover Deferral
Account shall be deemed to bear interest at the same rate and subject to the
same conditions as other Deferral Accounts pursuant to Section 4.2.  Each Participant who makes a rollover
transfer to a   

6  

Rollover Deferral
Account shall be treated for purposes of determining benefits under the Plan as
having a separate Cumulative Deferral Amount and Deferral Account which shall
initially be in the amount of the rollover transfer.  A Participant who makes a rollover transfer
shall be deemed to waive all rights under the Company s existing deferred
compensation plans from which rollover transfers are made with respect to the
amounts transferred to this Plan, including the right to make elections
regarding the time or manner of payment as permitted thereunder. Rollover
transfers shall be subject to the minimum deferral amount set forth in Section 4.1(a),
but shall not be subject to any maximum deferral limitation.  

4.4                                   Valuation
of Accounts.   The value of a Deferral
Account as of any date shall equal the amounts theretofore credited to such
account less any payments debited to such account plus the interest deemed to
be earned on such account in accordance with Section 4.2.  Interest shall be credited in accordance with
Appendix A. 

4.5                                   Statement
of Accounts.   The Committee shall
submit to each Participant, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
close of each Plan Year, a statement in such form as the Committee deems
desirable setting forth the balance standing to the credit of each Participant
in his Deferral Account. 

4.6                                   No
Future Deferrals.    No Employee or
Participant can make additional deferrals into the Plan. 

ARTICLE 5  

  BENEFITS  

5.1                                   Normal
or Early Retirement.   Upon a
Participant s Normal or Early Retirement, the payment of benefits shall
commence on the first day of the month following such Termination of
Employment, or following such later date which the Participant elected in his
Enrollment Agreement (including any authorization form).  A Participant may elect in his Enrollment
Agreement (including any authorization form) to have payments commence from one
(1) to ten (10) years following Termination of Employment, but not
later than age 65 (or five (5) years after the first day of the Benefit
Deferral Period, if later). 

(a)                                    Single
Participant.   In the case of a
Participant who is single when payments commence, the Employer shall make
periodic payments to the Participant in an amount in accordance with Appendix
A, Section 2.B., for the life of the Participant, but not less than
fifteen (15) years.  The payments shall
be the actuarial equivalent of the aggregate of the Participant s Deferral
Account at the time payments commence and the interest that will accrue on the
unpaid balance in such Deferral Account during the payment period pursuant to Section 4.2(a).  The payment amount will be redetermined
annually to reflect the changes in the Declared Rate. 

(b)                                   Married
Participant.   In the case of a
Participant who is married when payments commence, the Employer shall make
actuarially reduced payments in accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.B.,
to the Participant for his life and thereafter, if the Participant is survived
by a spouse who was married to the Participant when Normal or Early Retirement
Benefit payments commenced, shall continue to make payments to the Participant s
spouse for  

7  

his life, with payments to be made for an aggregate period of not less
than fifteen (15) years.  The payments
shall be the actuarial equivalent of the payments which would be made to the
Participant pursuant to Section 5.1(a) if he were single.  The monthly amount of payments will be
redetermined annually to reflect changes in the Declared Rate.  

5.2                                   Termination
Benefit.  

(a)                                    Terminations
of Employment.   If a Participant has
a Termination of Employment for any reason other than death or Normal or Early
Retirement, the Employer shall pay to the Participant in one immediate lump sum
an amount (the  Termination Benefit ) equal to the value of the Deferral
Account as of the date of payment and such Participant shall be entitled to no
further benefits under this Plan.  Upon
Termination of Employment (as defined in paragraph (a) of that definition)
the Participant shall immediately cease to be eligible for any benefits under
the Plan other than the Termination Benefit. 
Payment will be made as soon as practicable but not more than 90 days following
the Participant s Termination of Employment or at such later time provided in Section 5.3.  Except as provided in paragraph (b) below,
no other benefit shall be payable to either the Participant or any Beneficiary
of such Participant. 

(b)                                   Certain
Terminations of Employment.   If a
Participant has a Termination of Employment after attaining age 50, but prior
to attaining age 55, and the Participant has worked for the Company for at
least 10 years, and has received an ICP Contract under the Company s Income
Continuance Policy that is signed by Participant and Company and not rescinded,
the Participant will be entitled to an additional, immediate lump sum
distribution equal to the difference between: 

(i) The actuarial equivalent lump sum value of
the periodic payments scheduled to be made to the Participant determined in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.B for the life of the Participant,
but not less than fifteen (15) years payments; and  

(ii)  The value of the Participant s Deferral
Account.  

(c)                                    Termination
of Enrollment in Plan.   With the
written consent of the Committee, a Participant may terminate his enrollment in
the Plan by filing with the Committee a written request to terminate
enrollment.  The Committee will consent
to the termination of a Participant s enrollment in the Plan in the event of an
unforeseeable financial emergency of the Participant.  An unforeseeable financial emergency shall
mean an unexpected need for cash arising from an illness, casualty loss, sudden
financial reversal or other such unforeseeable occurrence, but only if and to the extent such
unforeseeable emergency constitutes an  unforeseeable emergency  under Code
section 409A.  Cash needs arising
from foreseeable events such as the purchase of a house or education expenses
for children shall not be considered to be the result of an unforeseeable
financial emergency.  Upon termination of
enrollment, no further reductions shall be made in the Participant s Earnings
pursuant to his Enrollment Agreement, and the Participant shall immediately
cease to be eligible for any benefits under the Plan other than the Termination
Benefit.  No other benefit shall be
payable to either the Participant or any Beneficiary of such Participant.  In its sole discretion, to the extent
necessary to relieve the unforeseeable emergency, the Committee may pay such
benefit on a date earlier than the Participant s Termination of Employment with
the Employer.  Following termination of
enrollment in the Plan, a Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to
bear interest on the  

8  

balance in such Deferral
Account in accordance with Appendix A, Section 1, except that the interest
rate used to calculate interest earned in the Deferral Account shall be twelve
percent (12%) per annum.  

5.3                                             Lump
Sum Election.   Other provisions of Section 5.1
and Section 5.2 notwithstanding, if a Participant in his Enrollment
Agreement (including any authorization form) has elected a lump sum payment to
be made after his Termination of Employment, the amount of his Deferral Account
(including interest) for the Benefit Deferral Period covered by that Agreement
shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum at the time specified in that
Agreement. 

5.4                                             [Deleted]  

5.5                                   Survivor
Benefits .  Paragraphs (a) and (b) shall
apply to Participants whose death occurs prior to Termination of
Employment.  Paragraph (c) reflects
the survivor benefit rules that apply to annuity benefits that are payable
on account of a Participant s Termination of Employment. 

(a)                         If a
Participant dies prior to his or her Termination of Employment prior to
attaining age 55, the Employer will pay to the Participant s Beneficiary an
annual benefit for the greater of: 

(i)  ten (10) years,
or  

(ii)  until
the Participant would otherwise have attained age 65,  

in an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the Cumulative Deferral Amount; provided, however, if
the Committee determines that installment distribution of the Participant s
Deferral Account (determined below) would produce a greater benefit, such
Deferral Account balance shall be paid to the Participant s Beneficiary in
equal annual installments in accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.C.2,
but over the period specified above. 
Payments will commence immediately (within 60 days) following the
Participant s death, and will be made each subsequent anniversary of the
Participant s death.  

(b)                        If a
Participant dies prior to Termination of Employment after attaining age 55, the
Employer will pay to the Participant s Beneficiary the benefit that such
Participant would have received had the Participant retired on the day prior to
such Participant s death.  Payments will
commence immediately (within 60 days) following the Participant s death, and
will be made each subsequent anniversary of the Participant s death.  Additionally, if the present value of the
benefit described in this Section 5.5(b) is less than the present
value of the benefit described in Section 5.5(a), using in each case
twelve percent (12%) as the discount factor, then the Beneficiary shall receive
an immediate lump sum payment equal to difference of such present values. 

(c)                         If a
Participant (who was unmarried at the commencement of the payment of any Early
or Normal Retirement Benefit, or whose spouse who was married to the
Participant at the time of commencement of payment of any Early or Normal
Retirement Benefit predeceases the Participant) dies after the commencement of
the payment of any Early or Normal Retirement Benefit, the Employer will pay to
the Participant s Beneficiary the remaining installments of any such benefit
for the balance of the fifteen (15) years minimum payment period.  If a spouse who was married to the
Participant at the time of commencement of payment  

9  

of the Early or Normal
Retirement Benefit survives beyond such fifteen (15) years minimum payment
period, payments shall continue to be made to the spouse until the spouse s
death.  If the spouse who was married to
the Participant at the time of commencement of payment of the Early or Normal
Retirement Benefit survives the Participant, but does not survive past the
fifteen (15) years minimum payment period, the Employer will pay to the
Participant s Beneficiary the remaining installments of any such benefit for
the balance of the fifteen (15) years minimum payment period.  In computing any benefits to be paid
following the Participant s death pursuant to this paragraph (c), the
Participant s Deferral Account shall be deemed to bear interest following the
Participant s death on the balance in such Deferral Account annually in
accordance with Appendix A, Section 2.B.  

5.6            Small Benefit.    Subject to Section 5.8, in the event that the vested Deferral
Account balance under the Plan of a Participant who has died or experienced a
Termination of Employment is less than the applicable dollar amount under Code
section 402(g)(1)(B) for that Plan Year as of the date on which the
Company makes such determinations, the Company reserves the right to have the
Participant s entire Deferral Account paid in the form of a single lump sum
payment provided the Company s exercise of discretion complies with the
requirements of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(v). 

5.7            Withholding.   To the extent required by the law in effect
at the time payments are made, the Employer shall withhold from payments made
hereunder the minimum taxes that the Employer reasonably determines is required
to be withheld by the federal or any state or local government.  

5.8            Delay in Payment Required by Code Section 409A.   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article 5,
if a Participant is a Specified Employee at Termination of Employment, then any
distributions arising on account of the Participant s Termination of Employment
(other than on account of death) shall be suspended and not be made until (6) months
have elapsed since such Participant s Termination of Employment (or, if
earlier, upon the date of the Participant s death).  Any payments that were otherwise payable
during the six-month suspension period referred to in the preceding sentence,
will be paid within 60 days after the end of such six-month suspension period . 
During the six-month suspension period, delayed payments will earn
interest at the Declared Rate. 

5.9            Acceleration of Distributions.   The Committee in its sole discretion may
exercise discretion to accelerate the distribution of any payment under this
Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A.  

5.10          Delay of Distributions.   The Committee in its sole discretion may
exercise discretion to delay the distribution of any payment under this Plan to
the extent allowed under Code section 409A, including, but not limited to, as
necessary to maximize the Company s tax deductions as allowed pursuant to Code
section 162(m) or to avoid violation of federal securities or other
applicable law.

  BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION  

Each Participant shall
have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as Beneficiary
or Beneficiaries to whom payment under this Plan shall be made in the event of
the Participant s death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of
the benefits due under the Plan.  Each
Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with
the Committee during the Participant s lifetime on a form prescribed by the
Committee.  

The filing of a new
Beneficiary designation form will cancel all Beneficiary designations
previously filed.  Any finalized divorce
or marriage (other than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to
the date of filing of a Beneficiary designation form shall revoke such
designation unless in the case of divorce the previous spouse was not
designated as Beneficiary and unless in the case of marriage the Participant s
new spouse had previously been designated as Beneficiary.  The spouse of a married Participant domiciled
in a community property jurisdiction shall join in any designation of
Beneficiary or Beneficiaries other than the spouse.  

If a Participant fails to
designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if his Beneficiary designation is
revoked by marriage, divorce, or otherwise without execution of a new
designation, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or
die prior to complete distribution of the Participant s benefits, then the
Committee shall direct the distribution of such benefits to the Participant s
estate.  

ARTICLE 7  

  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN  

7.1               Amendment .  The Board of Directors of the Company may at
any time amend the Plan, in whole or in part for any reason, including but not
limited to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to
terminate the Plan for future deferrals (excluding from such power to terminate
future deferrals those future deferrals provided for in Section 5.4  Early
Payout Option ); provided, however,
that no amendment shall be effective to decrease the benefits, nature or
timing thereof payable under the Plan to any Participant with respect to
deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the date of such
amendment.  Written notice of any
amendment shall be given each Participant then participating in the Plan.  Notwithstanding the above, the Board
authorizes the Committee to amend the Plan to make any other amendments to this
Plan deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee for the operation and
administration of this Plan provided such amendment does not have a material
financial impact on the Company.  Such
changes will be considered an Amendment to this Plan and shall be effective
without further action by the Board. 

7.2               Termination of Plan .  The Plan shall terminate only under the
following circumstances. 

(a)               General
Rule .  To the extent that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be
immediately included in the income of the Participant, as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent
permitted under Code section 409A, the Board may terminate this Plan,    in whole or in part, as it relates to the impacted  

11  

Participant.  Upon any such termination of the Plan, the  Employer
will pay the respective Participant the value of the Participant s Deferral
Accounts in an immediate lump sum, determined as if the Participant had a
Termination of Employment on the date of such termination of the Plan as
provided under Section 5.2(a) hereof.  

(b)               Plan Termination and Liquidation on Account
of a Change-in-Control.   Upon a Change-in-Control, as defined in Section 7.3
hereof, the Plan will terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will
be accelerated if and to the extent provided in this Section 7.2(b) hereof. 

(i)               The Plan will be terminated effective as of
the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a Change-in-Control
under Section 7.3(a), and (ii) a funding of the trust on account of
such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the  Plan termination effective
date ) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective date, the Board
affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated as of such
effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to irrevocably
terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its failure to
affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such date. 

(ii)              The determination by the Board under paragraph (b)(i) constitutes
a determination that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code
section 409A, including an agreement by the Company that it will take such
additional action or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to
satisfy the requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under
paragraph (iii) below. 

(iii)             In the event the Board does not affirmatively determine not to
terminate the Plan as provided in paragraph (b)(i),  such termination shall be subject to either (A) or
(B), as follows: 

(A)           If the Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for
purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be
accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon a administratively practicable but
not more than 90 days following the Plan termination effective date, provided
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)((ix)(B) have
been satisfied. 

(B)            If the Change-in-Control does not qualify as a  change in control event 
for purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will
be accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable
but not more than 90 days following the 12 month anniversary of the Plan
termination effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C) have
been satisfied. 

(iv)             Any lump sums paid
pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) will be calculated as provided in
Appendix B of the Target Corporation Deferred Compensation Trust Agreement.

7.3               Change-in-Control
Definition . 

(a)              A  Change-in-Control  shall be deemed to have occurred if: 

(i)      50% or more
of the directors of the Company shall be persons other than persons 

(A)             for whose election proxies shall have been solicited by the Board, or

entity resulting from a Business Combination in which clauses (x) and (y) of
subparagraph (iii) apply, or 

(iii)                             the consummation of a merger or consolidation
of the Company with or into another entity, a statutory share exchange, a sale

owners of the Company s Voting Stock immediately prior to such Business
Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of the
voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock (or comparable

such Business Combination (including such beneficial ownership of an entity
that, as a result of such transaction, owns the Company or all or substantially
all of the Company s assets either directly or through one or more

(iv)                             approval by the shareholders of a definitive
agreement or plan to liquidate or dissolve the Company. 

For purposes of this 7.3,  Voting

Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company.  

ARTICLE 8

APPENDIX
A   

  Section 1  

Participant Deferral Account Interest Crediting
While in Active Status Assuming No Further Deferrals   

A.       A Participant shall receive
interest credited monthly equal to the Participant s beginning-of-year (BOY)
Deferral Account balance times the Declared Rate divided by twelve: 

Interest crediting occurs up to the day the
Participant begins to receive annuity payments from the Plan.  

Example of interest credited calculation   

B.       A participant s Deferral
Account balance shall be increased each month by taking the beginning-of-month
(BOM) balance plus interest credited for the month to equal the end-of-month
(EOM) balance. 

16  

Section 2:   

   Interest Crediting, Deferral Account Balances, and
Payments While in Pay Status   

A.               Definition of
Variables for Participant Payment Calculation 

1.         n  = number of payments
expected to be made to a Participant and spouse. The number of expected
payments shall be determined by: (1) The ages of the Participant and
spouse at the time annuity payments first begin. (2) The number of years
that the Participant and spouse are expected to live, as determined by an
actuarially-based mortality table selected by the Committee. (3) The
frequency of payments made to the Participant. This frequency shall be
determined by the payroll procedures of the Company s operating division
responsible for administering the Participant s payments. 

Example of number of expected payments (assuming payments to begin on
10/1/99)   

2.         i  = interest rate per
payment period such that when compounded over the entire year equals the
Declared Rate. 

i  shall be expressed either as a weekly or monthly interest rate,
depending on the frequency of annuity payments made by the operating division
administering the Participant s payments. If weekly,  i  is the interest rate
that, when compounded over 52 periods, will equal the Declared Rate. If
monthly,  i  is the interest rate that, when compounded over 12 periods, will
equal the Declared Rate.  

Example of weekly and monthly interest rates   

Declared Rate = 13.7%  

  Weekly  i  = (1.137)  1/52  = .002472 or .2472% 

  Monthly  i  = (1.137)  1/12  = .010757 or 1.0757% 

3.        The beginning-of-period
balance (BOP balance) is the Participant s Deferral Account balance at any time
before credited interest has been added for the period and payments have been
subtracted for the period. 

End-of-period balance (EOP balance) is the Participant s Deferral
Account balance at any point in time after credited interest has been added for
the period and payments have been subtracted for the period.  

Example of EOP balance calculation   

EOP balance = BOP balance + interest crediting   payment  

17  

B.       Payments 

1.        Calculation of payments 

At the beginning of each year (or at the beginning of a month when a
Participant s Deferral Account is first transferred from active status to
payment status), a payment shall be calculated for each Participant who has a
Deferral Account that is in the payment status. The periodicity of payments
shall depend on the payroll procedures of the operating division administering
the Participant s payments. The amount of the payment shall be effective for
that calendar year (or portion of the calendar year).  

The calculation of the payment amount is based on the present value of
an annuity formula. Specifically, the payment is given by:  

Example of a calculation
with monthly payments   

n = 476 months  

  Monthly i = 1.0757%  

  BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Payment = $5,411.73  

Example of a calculation
with weekly payments   

n = 2,070 weeks  

  Weekly i = 0.2472%  

  BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Payment = $1,243.50  

2.        Interest Crediting for
Payments 

Interest crediting shall be calculated every payment
period, with the interest amount equal to the beginning-of-period Deferral
Account balance times the periodic interest rate  

Example of interest
crediting calculation (assuming monthly payments and a 13.7% Declared Rate)   

BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Monthly i = 1.0757%  

  Interest crediting = $500,000.00     
..010757 = $5,378.50 

18  

3.        Amortization of Participant
Deferral Account Balances 

Participant Deferral Account balances shall be
amortized over the remaining number of expected 
payment periods by adding to the beginning-of-period balance the
interest credits earned during the period less the payment made for the period
to produce an end-of-period Deferral Account balance.  

Example of Deferral
Account balance amortization (assuming monthly payments and a 13.7% Declared
Rate)   

BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Monthly i = 1.0757%  

  Interest crediting = $5,378.50  

  Payment = $5,411.73  

  EOP balance = $500,000.00 + $5,378.50   - 
$5,411.73 = $499,966.77 

C.       Installment
Termination Payments 

1.        [Intentionally left blank.] 

2.        The four equal annual
installment payments are determined by using the present value of an annuity
formula referenced in Section 2.B.1. of this Appendix. The interest rate
used in calculating the four payments shall be 12%. 

Example of a four-year annual installment payout of a
Deferral Account balance  

n = 4  

  Annual i = 12%  

  BOP balance = $500,000.00  

  Annual installment
payments = $164,617.22

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

SECTION 1   

   INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS   

1.1                 Name of Plan; History.   This Plan (formerly known as the  Target Corporation SMG Executive
Officer Deferred Compensation Plan) is a non-qualified, unfunded plan
established for the purpose of allowing a select group of management or highly
compensated employees to defer the receipt of income.  This Plan was originally adopted effective as
of January 1, 1997 and was amended at various times thereafter.  Effective April 30, 2002, Participants
in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee
received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit
under the supplemental pension plans maintained by the Company.  Each subsequent April, the Participant
receives annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credits equal to the change in value of
his or her benefit under the supplemental pension plans.  Effective July 31, 2002, this program
was extended to include all officers of the Company.  Effective April 30, 2002, Participants
in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee
received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit
under the Company s ESBP.  Each
subsequent April, Participants received annual credits equal to the change in
value of his or her benefit under the ESBP. 
Effective October 28, 2005, all officers who had not previously
received ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits, received a one-time transfer of the
present value of their benefit under the ESBP. 
As of January 28, 2006, a one-time ESBP credit was made to certain
executive committee members and no subsequent ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits
were made to those receiving the one-time ESBP credit.  From time to time, certain participants in the
Target Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan   Senior Management Group ( ODCP )
and the Company negotiated to transfer the economic value of their benefit
under ODCP to this Plan.  Officers
eligible to receive performance share awards granted in the fiscal years ending
February 1, 2003 and January 31, 2004 had an opportunity to defer
receipt of the value of the earned performance shares into this Plan at the end
of the performance period.  The
performance period for the shares granted in 2003 ended February 3,
2007.  The performance period for the
shares granted in 2004 ended February 2, 2008.  Effective January 1, 2005 (and other
effective dates as specifically provided), this Plan was operated in compliance
with Code section 409A.  Effective January 29,
2006, members of the Company s executive committee ceased to be eligible to
receive enhanced earnings on their account balances.  This Plan Statement, which is intended to
comply with Code section 409A, is effective January 1, 2009.

6.2.8       No Spousal Rights.     No spouse, former spouse, Beneficiary or
other person shall have any right to participate in the Participant s
designation of a form or time of payment.  

6.3          Six-Month Suspension for Specified Employees.     Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Section 6 to the contrary, if a Participant is a
Specified Employee at Termination of Employment, then any distributions arising
on account of the Participant s Termination of Employment (other than on
account of death) that are due shall be suspended and not be made until (6) months
have elapsed since such Participant s Termination of Employment (or, if
earlier, upon the date of the Participant s death).  Any payments that were otherwise payable
during the   

22  

six-month
suspension period referred to in the preceding sentence, will be paid within 60
days after the end of such six-month suspension period.  

6.4          Distribution on Account of Death.     Upon the death of a
Participant, the Participant s Account balance will be paid to the Participant s
Beneficiary in a single lump sum within 90 days following the Participant s
death.  

6.5          Distribution on Account of Unforeseeable Emergency.   

6.5.1       When Available.     A Participant may receive a
distribution from the vested portion of his or her Account (which shall be
deemed to include the deferral that would have been made but for the
cancellation under Section 6.5.3) if the Plan Administrator determines
that such distribution is on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency and the
conditions in Section 6.5.2 have been fulfilled.  To receive such a distribution, the
Participant must request a distribution by filing an application with the Plan
Administrator and furnish such supporting documentation as the Plan
Administrator may require.  In the
application, the Participant shall specify the basis for the distribution and
the dollar amount to be distributed.  If
such request is approved by the Plan Administrator, distribution shall be made
in a lump sum payment within 60 days following the approval by the Plan
Administrator of the completed application.  

6.5.2       Limitations   .  The amount that may be distributed with
respect to a Participant s Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amounts
necessary to satisfy the emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes
reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into
account the extent to which such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved
through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation
of the Participant s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would
not itself cause severe financial hardship), and/or cancellation of deferrals
pursuant to Section 6.5.3, provided the determination of such limitation
is consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii).  

6.5.3       Cancellation of
Deferral Elections.     As provided by Section 2.12,
in the event of a distribution under Section 6.5.1 the Plan Administrator
will cancel the Participant s deferral elections for the balance of the
applicable Plan Year.  

6.6          Designation of Beneficiaries.   

6.6.1       Right to Designate or
Revoke.   

(a)                                      Each
Participant may designate one or more primary Beneficiaries or secondary
Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant s vested
Account in the event of such Participant s death.  If fewer than all designated primary or
secondary Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the amount of such
predeceased Beneficiary s portion shall be allocated to the remaining primary
or secondary Beneficiaries, as the case may be.  

(b)                                     The Participant
may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to
or consent from any spouse, any person named as Beneficiary or any other
person.  

(c)                                      No such
designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless completed and filed
with the Plan Administrator in accordance with Plan Rules during the
Participant s lifetime.  

23  

6.6.2       Failure of Designation   .  If a Participant:  

(a)                                      fails to
designate a Beneficiary,  

(b)                                     designates a
Beneficiary and thereafter revokes such designation without naming another
Beneficiary, or  

(c)                                      designates one
or more Beneficiaries and all such Beneficiaries so designated fail to survive
the Participant, such Participant s vested Account, shall be payable to the
first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries:  

Participant s
surviving spouse 
Representative of Participant s estate  

6.6.3       Disclaimers by
Beneficiaries   .  A
Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of a deceased
Participant s vested Account may disclaim an interest therein subject to the
Plan Rules.  

6.6.4       Special Rules.     Unless the Participant has
otherwise specified in the Participant s Beneficiary designation, the following
rules shall apply:  

(a)                                      If there is not
sufficient evidence that a person designated as a Beneficiary was living at the
time of the death of the Participant, it shall be deemed that the Beneficiary
was not living at the time of the death of the Participant.  

(b)                                     The automatic
Beneficiaries specified in Section 6.6.2 and the Beneficiaries designated
by the Participant shall become fixed at the time of the Participant s death
(subject to Section 6.6.3) so that, if a Beneficiary survives the
Participant but dies before the receipt of all payments due such Beneficiary
hereunder, such remaining payments shall be payable to the representative of
such Beneficiary s estate.  

(c)                                      If the
Participant designates as a Beneficiary the person who is the Participant s
spouse on the date of the designation, either by name or by relationship, or
both, the dissolution, annulment or other legal termination of the marriage
between the Participant and such person shall automatically revoke such
designation.  The foregoing shall not
prevent the Participant from designating a former spouse as a beneficiary on a
form that is both executed by the Participant and received by the Plan
Administrator (i) after the date of the legal termination of the marriage
between the Participant and such former spouse and (ii) during the
Participant s lifetime.  

(d)                                     A finalized
marriage (other than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to the
date of filing of a Beneficiary designation shall revoke such designation
unless the Participant s new spouse had previously been designated as the Beneficiary.  

(e)                                      Any designation
of a nonspouse Beneficiary by name that is accompanied by a description of
relationship to the Participant shall be given effect without regard   

24  

to whether the relationship to the Participant exists either then or at
the Participant s death.  

(f)                                        Any designation
of a Beneficiary only by statement of relationship to the Participant shall be
effective only to designate the person or persons standing in such relationship
to the Participant at the Participant s death.  

6.7          Facility of Payment.   

6.7.1       Legal Disability.     In case of the legal
disability, including minority, of an individual entitled to receive any
payment under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Plan Administrator shall
be advised of the existence of such condition:  

(a)                                      to the duly
appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such
individual, or  

(b)                                     to a person or
institution entrusted with the care or maintenance of the incompetent or disable
Participant or Beneficiary, provided such person or institution has satisfied
the Plan Administrator that the payment will be used for the best interest and
assist in the care of such individual, and provided further, that no prior
claim for said payment has been made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator
or other legal representative of such individual.  

6.7.2       Discharge of
Liability.     Any payment
made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 shall
constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the
Participating Employers under this Plan.  

6.8          Tax Withholding.     The
Participating Employer (or any other person legally obligated to do so) shall
withhold the amount of any federal, state or local income tax, payroll tax or
other tax that the payer reasonably determines is required to be withheld under
applicable law with respect to any amount payable under this Plan.  All benefits otherwise due hereunder shall be
reduced by the amount to be withheld.  

6.9          Payments
Upon Rehire.     If a
Participant who is receiving installment payments or due a deferred lump sum
payment under this Plan is rehired, the payments will continue in accordance
with the prior distribution elections.  

6.10        Application for Distribution. 
   A Participant may be required to make application to receive payment
and to complete other forms and furnish other documentation required by the
Plan Administrator.  Distribution shall
not be made to any Beneficiary until such Beneficiary shall have filed an
application for benefits in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator and
such application shall have been approved by the Plan Administrator and the
Plan Administrator has determined that the applicant is entitled to payment.  

6.11        Acceleration of Distributions. 
   The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion
to accelerate the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent
allowed under Code section 409A.  

6.12        Delay of Distributions.     The Plan
Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion to delay the
distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code
section 409A, including, but not limited to, as necessary to maximize the
Company s tax   

25  

deductions
as allowed pursuant to Code section 162(m) or to avoid violation of
federal securities or other applicable law.  

26  

SECTION 7   

   SOURCE OF PAYMENTS; NATURE OF INTEREST   

7.1          Source of Payments.   

7.1.1           General
Assets.     Each Participating Employer
will pay, from its general assets, the distribution of the Participant s
Account under Section 6, and all costs, charges and expenses relating
thereto.  

7.1.2       Trust.     Upon a Change-in-Control
that causes the Plan to be terminated under Section 8.3.2, the trustee of
the Trust will make distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries from the
Trust in satisfaction of a Participating Employer s obligations to make
distributions under this Plan in accordance with and subject to the terms of
the Trust to the extent such payments are not otherwise made directly by the
Participating Employer.  

7.2          Unfunded Obligation.     The obligation
of the Participating Employers to make payments under this Plan constitutes
only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Participating
Employers to make such payments. 
Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns
shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims or interests in any specific
property or assets of the Company or a Participating Employer, nor shall they
be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life
insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may
be acquired by the Company.  

7.3          Establishment of Trust.     The
Participating Employers shall have no obligation to establish or maintain any
fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the
purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan except as
provided in the Trust.  The Participating
Employers may from time to time transfer to the Trust cash, or other marketable
securities or other property acceptable to the trustee in accordance with the
terms of the Trust.  If the Participating
Employers have deposited funds in the Trust, such funds shall remain the sole
and exclusive property of the Participating Employer that deposited such funds.  

7.4          Spendthrift Provision.     Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 7.4, no Participant or Beneficiary
shall have any interest in any Account which can be transferred nor shall any
Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of,
pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of the
Participating Employers.  The Plan
Administrator shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under
this Plan.  No benefit payable under this
Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following
judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person.  

7.4.1       Right to Designate
Beneficiary.     The power to
designate Beneficiaries to receive the Account of a Participant in the event of
such Participant s death shall not permit or be construed to permit such power
or right to be exercised by the Participant    so as thereby
to anticipate, pledge, mortgage or encumber such Participant s Account or any
part thereof, and any attempt of a Participant so to exercise said power in
violation of this provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be
disregarded by the Participating Employers.  

7.4.2       Plan Administrator s
Right to Exercise Discretion.     This Section 7.4
shall not prevent the Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion,
any of the applicable powers and options granted to it under any applicable
provision hereof.  

27  

SECTION 8   

   ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

8.1          Adoption.     With the prior
approval of the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may adopt the Plan and become
a Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan Administrator a certified
copy of a resolution of its board of directors adopting this Plan.  

8.2          Amendment.   

8.2.1       General Rule.     The Board may at any time
amend this Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited
to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate
this Plan for future deferrals; provided, unless such amendment is necessary or
reasonable to comply with any changes in law, no amendment shall be effective
to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under this Plan to
any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter
accruing) prior to the date of such amendment. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board authorizes the Committee to amend
this Plan to make changes to the Crediting Rate Alternatives by either adding
any new or deleting any existing Crediting Rate Alternatives, to impose
limitations on selection of or deferral into any Crediting Rate Alternative, or
to make any amendments to this Plan Statement deemed necessary or desirable by
the Committee for the operation and administration of this Plan provided such
amendment does not have a material financial impact on the Company.  Such changes will be considered an Amendment
to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the Board.  Written notice of any amendment shall be
given to each Participant then participating in this Plan.  

8.2.2       Amendment to Benefit
of Executive Officer.     Any amendment
to the benefit of an executive officer under this Plan, to the extent approval
of such amendment by the board of directors would be required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board.  

8.2.3       No Oral
Amendments.     No modification
of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in
writing.  No oral representation
concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be
effective to amend this Plan Statement.  

8.3          Termination and Liquidation.   

8.3.1       General Rule.   

(a)                                      To the extent
necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any
time terminate and liquidate this Plan, provided such termination and
liquidation satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A.  

(b)                                     To the extent
that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the
income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section
409A, the Board may terminate and liquidate this Plan,    in
whole or in part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.  

8.3.2       Plan Termination and
Liquidation on Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control, the Plan will
terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if and
to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2.  

28  

(a)                                      The Plan will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.8(a), and (ii) a funding of the
Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the  Plan
termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective
date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated
as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to
irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its
failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such
date.  

(b)                                     The
determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination
that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A,
including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action
or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.  

(c)                                      In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as
provided in paragraph (a),  such
termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows:  

(i)                                         If the
Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
made in a lump sum as soon a administratively practicable but not more than 90
days following the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) have been
satisfied.  

(ii)                                      If the
Change-in-Control does not qualify as a  change in control event  for purposes
of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated
and made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but not more
than 60 days following the 12 month anniversary of the Plan termination
effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C) have
been satisfied.  

29

9.1                              Claims Procedure.   Until modified by the Plan Administrator, the claim and review
procedures set forth in this Section shall be the mandatory claim and
review procedures for the resolution of disputes and disposition of claims
filed under this Plan.  An application
for a distribution or withdrawal shall be considered as a claim for the
purposes of this Section. 

9.1.1                            Initial Claim.   An individual may, subject to any applicable deadline, file with the

the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant of the adverse benefit
determination within ninety (90) days after receipt of the claim. 

(b)                                    The ninety (90) day period for making the
claim determination may be extended for ninety (90) days if the Plan
Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of
time for determination of the claim, provided that the Plan Administrator
notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial ninety (90) day
period, of the special circumstances requiring an extension and the date by
which a claim determination is expected to be made. 

9.1.2                            Notice of Initial Adverse
Determination.   A notice of an adverse determination shall
set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.

determination notice, the claimant may file with the Plan Administrator a
written request for a review of the adverse determination and may, in
connection therewith submit written comments, documents, records and other
information relating to the claim benefits. 
Any request for review of the initial adverse determination not filed
within sixty (60) days after receipt of the initial adverse determination notice
shall be untimely. 

9.1.4                            Claim on Review.   If the claim, upon review, is denied in whole or in part, the Plan
Administrator shall notify the claimant of the adverse benefit determination
within sixty (60) days after receipt of such a request for review. 

30  

(a)                                     The sixty (60) day period for deciding the
claim on review may be extended for sixty (60) days if the Plan Administrator
determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for determination
of the claim, provided that the Plan Administrator notifies the claimant, prior
to the expiration of the initial sixty (60) day period, of the special
circumstances requiring an extension and the date by which a claim
determination is expected to be made. 

(b)                                    In the event that the time period is extended
due to a claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim
on review, the claimant shall have sixty (60) days within which to provide the
necessary information and the period for making the claim determination on
review shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension
is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the
request for additional information or, if earlier, the expiration of sixty (60)
days. 

(c)                                     The Plan Administrator s review of a denied
claim shall take into account all comments, documents, records, and other
information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to
whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit
determination.

procedures offered by the Plan and the claimant s right to obtain information
about such procedures, and 

(e)                                     a statement of the claimant s right to bring

9.2.1                            Adoption of Rules.   Any rule not in conflict or at variance with the provisions hereof
may be adopted by the Plan Administrator. 

31  

9.2.2                            Specific Rules.  

(a)                                     No inquiry or question shall be deemed to be
a claim or a request for a review of a denied claim unless made in accordance
with the established claim procedures. 
The Plan Administrator may require that any claim for benefits and any
request for a review of a denied claim be filed on forms to be furnished by the
Plan Administrator upon request. 

(b)                                    All decisions on claims and on requests for a
review of denied claims shall be made by the Plan Administrator unless
delegated as provided for in the Plan, in which case references in this Section 9
to the Plan Administrator shall be treated as references to the Plan
Administrator s delegate. 

(c)                                     Claimants may be represented by a lawyer or
other representative at their own expense, but the Plan Administrator reserves
the right to require the claimant to furnish written authorization and
establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been
authorized to act on behalf of a claimant. 
A claimant s representative shall be entitled to copies of all notices
given to the claimant. 

(d)                                    The decision of the Plan Administrator on a
claim and on a request for a review of a denied claim may be provided to the

Administrator. 

(e)                                     In connection with the review of a denied
claim, the claimant or the claimant s representative shall be provided, upon

SECTION 11 
CONSTRUCTION   

11.1                       ERISA Status.   This Plan was adopted and is maintained with the understanding that it

compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
as provided in section 201(2), section 301(a)(3) and section 401(a)(1) of
ERISA.  This Plan shall be interpreted
and administered accordingly.

arrangement that will comply in form and operation with the requirements of
Code section 409A and this Plan will be construed and administered in a manner
that is consistent with and gives effect to such intention. 

11.3                       Rules of Document

APPENDIX A   

SPP Benefit   

A-1                                   Purpose and Application.   The purpose of this Appendix A to this Plan Statement is to establish
the rules for determining the amount of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit
under this Plan. 

A-2                                   Background.  

A-2.1                         Transfer Credits.                                                   The Company has adopted and maintained
several nonqualified supplemental pension plans to provide retirement income to
a select group of highly compensated and key management employees in excess of
the retirement income that can be provided under the Target Pension Plan on
account of limitations imposed by the Code. 
Effective April 30, 2002, the Company began converting the accrued
supplemental pension benefits of certain participants to credits under this
Plan as adjusted annually to reflect changes in such benefits. 

A-2.2                         Cash Balance Formula .                   Effective January 1, 2003, the Target
Pension Plan was amended to add a cash balance pension plan formula (referred
to as the  personal pension account ). 
Depending on the date participation commences or an election was made, a
Participant who has a benefit under the Target Pension Plan may have his or her
accrued benefit under such plan based solely on the final average pay formula
(the  traditional formula ), solely on the personal pension account, or a
combination of the traditional formula (frozen as of December 31, 2002)
and the personal pension account. 

A-3                                   Definitions.  

A-3.1                         SPP I                       SPP I  means the Target Corporation SPP I. 

A-3.2                         SPP II                   SPP II  means the Target Corporation SPP II. 

A-3.3                         SPP III                    SPP
III  means the Target Corporation SPP III. 

A-4                                   SPP Benefit.   Each Participant s SPP Benefit is equal to the sum of the benefits
under Section A-4.1, Section A-4.2 and Section A-4.3. 

A-4.1                         Traditional Formula Benefit.   A Participant s SPP Benefit is the excess, if any, of the monthly
pension benefit under (a) over the monthly pension benefit under (b): 

(a)                                     The monthly pension benefit the Participant
would be entitled to under the Target Pension Plan, based on the  traditional
formula,  if such formula were applied 

(i)                                        without regard to the maximum benefit
limitation required by Code section 415; 

(ii)                                     without regard to the maximum compensation
limitation under Code section 401(a)(17); 

38  

(iii)                                 as if the definition of  certified earnings 
under the Target Pension Plan for a plan year included compensation that would
have been paid in the plan year in the absence of the Participant s election to
defer payment of the compensation to a later date pursuant to the provisions of
a deferred compensation plan; 

(iv)                                without regard to the alternative benefit
formula of Sections 4.6(a)(3) and 4.6(b)(2) of the Target
Pension  Plan. 

(b)                                    The monthly pension benefit the Participant
is entitled to receive under the Target Pension Plan on account of the  traditional
formula.  

A-4.2                         Personal Pension Account.   A Participant s SPP Benefit includes the excess, if any, of the amount
determined under (a) over the amount determined under (b): 

(a)                                     The amount that would have been credited each
quarter (including both  pay credits  and  interest credits ) to the
Participant s  personal pension account  under the Target Pension Plan, if such
account were applied: 

(i)                                       without regard to the maximum benefit
limitations required by Code section 415; 

(ii)                                    without regard to the maximum compensation
limitation under Code section 401(a)(17); 

(iii)                                 as if the definition of  certified earnings 
under the Target Pension Plan for a calendar quarter included compensation that
would have been paid during such calendar quarter in the absence of the
Participant s election to defer payment of the compensation to a later date
pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan; 

(iv)                                as if a distribution had been made from such
account equal to any SPP Benefit Transfer Credits made under Section 3.3. 

(b)                                    The amount of the credits actually made to
the Participant s  personal pension account  under the Target Pension Plan. 

A-4.3                         SPP III.   For a Participant who was participating in SPP III, the Participant s
SPP Benefit includes the actuarial equivalent lump sum present value of the
monthly pension benefit under (a) over the monthly pension benefit under
(b): 

(a)                                     The monthly pension benefits determined under
Section A-4.1(a) determined by treating the Participant as five (5) years
older than his or her actual age solely for purposes of determining the early
reduction factor (but in no case shall the Participant s age be deemed to be
greater than age 65). 

(b)                                    The monthly pension benefits determined under
Section A-4.1(a). 

A-4.4                         Company Determination.   The actuarial lump sum present value of a Participant s benefit
determined under this Appendix A will be determined by the Company, in  

39  

its
sole and absolute discretion, by using such factors and assumptions as the
Company considers appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion as of the
date of distribution or transfer.  

A-5                                   Forfeiture of SPP III Benefit.  

A-5.1                         Pre-Age 55 SPP III Forfeiture.                                
 A Participant who has
a Termination of Employment prior to attaining age 55 will forfeit that portion
of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer Credit and Earnings Credit determined under Section A-5.3. 

A-5.2                         ICP Eligibility SPP III
Forfeiture.   A Participant who becomes entitled to receive
payments under an income continuation plan or policy of an Affiliate on account
of his or her Termination of Employment after attaining age 55 will forfeit
that portion of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer Credit and Earnings Credit
determined under Section A-5.3. 

A-5.3                         Amount of SPP III
Forfeiture.   A Participant s forfeiture under Sections
A-5.1 or A-5.2 is that portion of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credits attributable
to his or her SPP Benefit determined under Section A-4.3 of Appendix A,
and an amount of Earnings Credits equal to the investment adjustment that would
have been credited on such SPP Benefit Transfer Credits at the Stable Value
Crediting Rate Alternative.

and subject to the requirements of this Plan. 

2.1.1                            Eligibility for Newly Eligible Director.   A Newly Eligible Director is eligible to participate in this Plan on
the date that is 30 days after he or she becomes a Director.

participation in this Plan, complete such forms and make such elections in
accordance with Plan Rules as the Plan Administrator may require for the
effective administration of this Plan. 

2.2                              Termination of Participation.   Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan Statement or by
the Committee, a Director who ceases to be a Director is not eligible to
continue to participate in the Plan, provided, that any deferral elections in
effect, and irrevocable, will continue to apply with respect to any
Retainers.  The Participant s Account
will continue to be governed by the terms of the Plan until such time as the
Participant s Account balance is paid in accordance with the terms of the
Plan.  A Participant or Beneficiary will
cease to be such as of the date on which his or her entire Account balance has
been distributed. 

2.3                              No Guarantee of Continued
Directorship.   Participation in
this Plan does not constitute a guarantee or contract with any Participating Employer guaranteeing that the
Director will continue to be a director. 
Such participation shall in no way interfere with any rights the
shareholders of a Participating Employer would have in the absence of such
participation to determine the duration of the director s service. 

2.4                              Deferral Elections.   A
Director who satisfies the eligibility requirements of Section 2 may, at
the time and in the manner provided hereunder, elect to defer the receipt of
his or her Retainer. 

2.4.1                            General.   Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, an
election shall be made before the beginning of the Plan Year during which the
Participant performs services for which the Retainer is earned.  The election must designate the percentage of
the Retainer which shall be deferred under this Plan.  In accordance with Plan Rules, the Plan
Administrator will determine the manner and timing required to file a deferral
election.  No deferral election shall be
effective unless prior to the deadline for making such election, the
Participant has filed with the Plan Administrator, in accordance with Plan
Rules, an insurance consent form permitting the Participating Employer or
Company to purchase and maintain life insurance coverage on the Director with
the Participating Employer or Company as the beneficiary.  An election to defer the Retainer for the
Plan Year or other period is irrevocable once it has been accepted by the Plan
Administrator and the deadline for making such election has expired, except as
otherwise provided under this Plan. 

2.4.2                            Newly Eligible Director.   For a Newly Eligible Director, the deferral
election may be made after the first day of a Plan Year provided it is made
within 30 days after becoming eligible to participate in this Plan.  Such a deferral election by a Newly Eligible
Director is irrevocable once it has been received by the Plan Administrator and
the deadline for making such election has expired, except as otherwise provided
under this Plan.  Such election will be  

7  

effective
with respect to Retainers for services commencing with the next full calendar
quarter after the deferral election becomes irrevocable.  

2.4.3                            Terminations of Employment.   A Participant who completes a deferral
election in accordance with this Section 2.4, but who has a Termination of
Employment prior to the deadline for making such election has expired, will be
deemed to have made no deferral election for the respective period. 

2.5                              Deferral of Retainers.      A Participant s election to defer a
Retainer is subject to the following requirements: 

2.5.1                           A deferral election will be effective with respect to the first
Retainer paid for services performed during the Plan Year and such election
will remain in effect through the last Retainer paid for services performed
during the Plan Year. 

2.5.2                           The Retainer deferral percentage may not exceed 100%. 

2.6                              Elective Deferral Credit .  The
Plan Administrator shall credit to the Account of each Participant the amount,
if any, of the Retainer the Participant elected to defer pursuant to this Section 2.  Such amount shall be credited as nearly as
practicable as of the time or times when the Retainer would have been paid to
the Participant but for the election to defer. 

2.7                              Cancellation of Deferral
Elections.   Notwithstanding any provisions in the Plan to
the contrary, an election to defer under this Section will be cancelled
for the remaining portion of the Plan Year in the event the Participant has
received a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency under Section 5.5.  The revocation shall be made at the time and
in the manner specified in Plan Rules and must otherwise comply with the
requirements of Section 5.5.

more Crediting Rate Alternatives to be used to measure income, gains and losses

Plan Administrator in accordance with Plan Rules.  

3.3.3       Crediting   .  As of each Valuation Date, each Participant s
Account shall be adjusted for income, gains and losses as if the Account had in

Investing Adjustments   .  The
Plan Administrator will not be responsible in any manner to any Participant,

Alternative.

causes a Trust to be established and funded pursuant to Section 6.3 where
distribution of a Participant s Account may not be made from the Trust within
60 days of the event because of restrictions imposed by Code section 409A, then
the Participant s Account as of the date of such event will no longer receive
adjustments determined pursuant to Section 3.3.

the date of an event described in Section 3.4.1, the Account will have an
investment adjustment determined at an annual rate equal to the sum of the
10-Year U.S. Treasury Note plus 2%.  The
10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rate will be determined as of the date of the Plan
termination under Section 7.3.2, or if no such rate is available on that

calendar quarter as necessary.

Participant who has died or experienced a Termination of Employment under the
Plan is less than the applicable dollar amount under Code section 402(g)(1)(B) for

5.5.1       When Available.     A Participant may receive a
distribution from the vested portion of his or her Account (which shall be
deemed to include the deferrals that would have been made but for the
cancellation under Section 5.5.3) if the Plan Administrator determines
that such distribution is on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency and the
conditions in Section 5.5.2 have been fulfilled.  To receive such a distribution, the
Participant must request a distribution by filing an application with the Plan
Administrator and furnish such supporting documentation as the Plan
Administrator may require.  In the

respect to a Participant s Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amounts
necessary to satisfy the emergency plus   

12  

amounts
necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution,
after taking into account the extent to which such Unforeseeable Emergency is
or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
otherwise by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent the
liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship),
and/or cancellation of deferrals pursuant to Section 5.5.3, provided the
determination of such limitation is consistent with the requirements of Code
section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii).  

5.5.3       Cancellation of
Deferral Elections.     As provided by Section 2.7,
in the event of a distribution under Section 5.5.1 the Plan Administrator

Participant may designate one or more primary Beneficiaries or secondary
Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant s vested
Account in the event of such Participant s death.  If fewer than all designated primary or
secondary Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the amount of such
predeceased Beneficiary s portion shall be allocated to the remaining primary
or secondary Beneficiaries, as the case may be.  

(b)                                     The Participant
may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to
or consent from any spouse, any person named as Beneficiary or any other
person.  

(c)                                      No such
designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless completed and filed
with the Plan Administrator in accordance with Plan Rules during the
Participant s lifetime.  

5.6.2       Failure of Designation   .  If a Participant:  

(a)                                      fails to
designate a Beneficiary,  

(b)                                     designates a
Beneficiary and thereafter revokes such designation without naming another Beneficiary,
or  

(c)                                      designates one
or more Beneficiaries and all such Beneficiaries so designated fail to survive
the Participant, such Participant s vested Account, shall be payable to the

Plan Rules.

otherwise specified in the Participant s Beneficiary designation, the following
rules shall apply:  

13  

(a)                                      If there is not
sufficient evidence that a person designated as a Beneficiary was living at the
time of the death of the Participant, it shall be deemed that the Beneficiary
was not living at the time of the death of the Participant.  

(b)                                     The automatic
Beneficiaries specified in Section 5.6.2 and the Beneficiaries designated
by the Participant shall become fixed at the time of the Participant s death
(subject to Section 5.6.3) so that, if a Beneficiary survives the
Participant but dies before the receipt of all payments due such Beneficiary
hereunder, such remaining payments shall be payable to the representative of
such Beneficiary s estate.  

(c)                                      If the
Participant designates as a Beneficiary the person who is the Participant s
spouse on the date of the designation, either by name or by relationship, or
both, the dissolution, annulment or other legal termination of the marriage
between the Participant and such person shall automatically revoke such
designation.  The foregoing shall not
prevent the Participant from designating a former spouse as a beneficiary on a
form that is both executed by the Participant and received by the Plan
Administrator (i) after the date of the legal termination of the marriage
between the Participant and such former spouse and (ii) during the
Participant s lifetime.  

(d)                                     A finalized
marriage (other than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to the
date of filing of a Beneficiary designation shall revoke such designation
unless the Participant s new spouse had previously been designated as the
Beneficiary.  

(e)                                      Any designation
of a nonspouse Beneficiary by name that is accompanied by a description of
relationship to the Participant shall be given effect without regard to whether
the relationship to the Participant exists either then or at the Participant s
death.  

(f)                                        Any designation
of a Beneficiary only by statement of relationship to the Participant shall be
effective only to designate the person or persons standing in such relationship
to the Participant at the Participant s death.  

5.7          Facility of Payment.   

5.7.1       Legal Disability.     In case of the legal
disability, including minority, of an individual entitled to receive any
payment under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Plan Administrator shall
be advised of the existence of such condition:  

(a)                                      to the duly
appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such
individual, or  

(b)                                     to a person or
institution entrusted with the care or maintenance of the incompetent or
disable Participant or Beneficiary, provided such person or institution has
satisfied the Plan Administrator that the payment will be used for the best
interest and assist in the care of such individual, and provided further, that
no prior claim for said payment has been made by a duly appointed guardian,
conservator or other legal representative of such individual.  

14  

5.7.2       Discharge of
Liability.     Any payment
made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.7 shall
constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the
Participating Employers under this Plan.  

5.8          Tax Withholding.     The
Participating Employer (or any other person legally obligated to do so) shall
withhold the amount of any federal, state or local income tax, payroll tax or
other tax that the payer reasonably determines is required to be withheld under
applicable law with respect to any amount payable under this Plan.  All benefits otherwise due hereunder shall be
reduced by the amount to be withheld.  

5.9          Application for Distribution. 
   A Participant may be required to make application to receive payment
and to complete other forms and furnish other documentation required by the
Plan Administrator.  Distribution shall
not be made to any Beneficiary until such Beneficiary shall have filed an
application for benefits in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator and
such application shall have been approved by the Plan Administrator and the
Plan Administrator has determined that the applicant is entitled to payment.  

5.10        Acceleration of Distributions. 
   The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion
to accelerate the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent
allowed under Code section 409A.  

5.11        Delay of Distributions.     The Plan
Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion to delay the
distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code
section 409A, including, but not limited to, as necessary to maximize the
Company s tax deduction as allowed pursuant to Code section 162(m) or to
avoid violation of securities law or other applicable law.  

15  

SECTION 6   

   SOURCE OF PAYMENTS; NATURE OF INTEREST   

6.1          Source of Payments.   

6.1.1       General Assets.     Each Participating Employer
will pay, from its general assets, the distribution of the Participant s
Account under Section 5, and all costs, charges and expenses relating
thereto.  

6.1.2       Trust.     Upon a Change-in-Control
that causes the Plan to be terminated under Section 7.3.2, the trustee of
the Trust will make distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries from the
Trust in satisfaction of a Participating Employer s obligations to make
distributions under this Plan in accordance with and subject to the terms of
the Trust to the extent such payments are not otherwise made directly by the
Participating Employer.  

6.2          Unfunded Obligation.     The obligation
of the Participating Employers to make payments under this Plan constitutes
only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Participating
Employers to make such payments. 
Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns
shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims or interests in any specific
property or assets of the Company or a Participating Employer, nor shall they
be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life
insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which
may be acquired by the Company.  

6.3          Establishment of Trust.     The
Participating Employers shall have no obligation to establish or maintain any
fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the
purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan except as
provided in the Trust.  The Participating
Employers may from time to time transfer to the Trust cash, or other marketable
securities or other property acceptable to the trustee in accordance with the
terms of the Trust.  If the Participating
Employers have deposited funds in the Trust, such funds shall remain the sole
and exclusive property of the Participating Employer that deposited such funds.  

6.4          Spendthrift Provision.     Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 6.4, no Participant or Beneficiary
shall have any interest in any Account which can be transferred nor shall any
Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of,
pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of the
Participating Employers.  The Plan
Administrator shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under
this Plan.  No benefit payable under this
Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following
judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person.  

6.4.1       Right to Designate
Beneficiary.     The power to
designate Beneficiaries to receive the Account of a Participant in the event of
such Participant s death shall not permit or be construed to permit such power
or right to be exercised by the Participant    so as thereby
to anticipate, pledge, mortgage or encumber such Participant s Account or any
part thereof, and any attempt of a Participant so to exercise said power in
violation of this provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be
disregarded by the Participating Employers.  

6.4.2       Plan Administrator s
Right to Exercise Discretion.     This Section 6.4
shall not prevent the Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion,
any of the applicable powers and options granted to it under any applicable
provision hereof.  

16  

SECTION 7   

   ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION   

7.1          Adoption.     With the prior
approval of the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may adopt the Plan and become
a Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan Administrator a certified
copy of a resolution of its board of directors adopting this Plan.  

7.2          Amendment.   

7.2.1       General Rule.     The Board may at any time
amend this Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited
to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate
this Plan for future deferrals; provided, unless such amendment is necessary or
reasonable to comply with any changes in law, no amendment shall be effective
to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under this Plan to
any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter
accruing) prior to the date of such amendment. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Board authorizes the Committee to amend
this Plan to make changes to the Crediting Rate Alternatives by either adding
any new or deleting any existing Crediting Rate Alternatives and to impose
limitations on selection of or deferral into any Crediting Rate Alternative.  Such changes will be considered an Amendment
to this Plan and shall be effective without further action by the Board.  Written notice of any amendment shall be
given to each Participant then participating in this Plan.  

7.2.2       No Oral
Amendments.     No modification
of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in
writing.  No oral representation
concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be
effective to amend this Plan Statement.  

7.3          Termination and Liquidation.   

7.3.1       General Rule.   

(a)                                      To the extent
necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any
time terminate and liquidate this Plan, provided such termination and
liquidation satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A.  

(b)                                     To the extent
that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the
income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A,
the Board may terminate and liquidate this Plan,    in
whole or in part, as it relates to the impacted Participant.  

7.3.2       Plan Termination and
Liquidation on Account of a Change-in-Control.     Upon a Change-in-Control the Plan will
terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if and
to the extent provided in this Section 7.3.2.  

(a)                                      The Plan will
be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a
Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.5(a), and (ii) a funding of the
Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the  Plan
termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective
date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated
as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to
irrevocably   

17  

terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its
failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such
date.  

(b)                                     The
determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination
that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A,
including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action
or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below.  

(c)                                      In the event
the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as
provided in paragraph (a),  such
termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows:  

(i)                                         If the
Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code
section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and
made in a lump sum as soon a administratively practicable but not more than 90
days following the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) have been
satisfied.  

(ii)                                      If the Change-in-Control
does not qualify as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code section
409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and made in a
lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but not more than 60 days
following the 12 month anniversary of the Plan termination effective date,
provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C) have
been satisfied.

(d)                                     A certificate
of either the secretary to the committee or a majority of the members of the
committee that the committee has taken or authorized any action will be
conclusive in favor of any person relying on the certificate.  

9.4          Service of Process.     In the absence
of any designation to the contrary by the Plan Administrator, the General
Counsel of the Plan Administrator is designated as the appropriate and
exclusive agent for the receipt of service of process directed to this Plan in
any legal proceeding, including arbitration, involving this Plan.  

9.5          Choice of Law.     Except to the
extent that federal law is controlling, this Plan Statement will be construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.  

9.6          Responsibility for Delegate. 
   No person shall be liable for an act or omission of another person with
regard to a responsibility that has been allocated to or delegated to such
other person pursuant to the terms of the Plan Statement or pursuant to
procedures set forth in the Plan Statement.  

9.7          Expenses.     All expenses of
administering the benefits due under this Plan shall be borne by the
Participating Employers.  

9.8          Errors in Computations.     It is
recognized that in the operation and administration of the Plan certain
mathematical and accounting errors may be made or mistakes may arise by reason
of factual errors in information supplied to the Company or trustee.  The Company shall have power to cause such
equitable adjustments to be made to correct for such errors as the Company, in
its sole discretion, considers appropriate. 
Such adjustments shall be final and binding on all persons.  

9.9          Indemnification.     In addition to
any other applicable provisions for indemnification, the Participating
Employers jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless, to the
extent permitted by law, each director, officer and employee of the
Participating Employers against any and all liabilities, losses, costs or
expenses (including legal fees) of whatsoever kind and nature which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such person at any time by reason
of   

24  

such
person s services as an administrator in connection with this Plan, but only if
such person did not act dishonestly, or in bad faith, or in willful violation
of the law or regulations under which such liability, loss, cost or expense
arises.  

9.10        Notice.     Any notice
required under this Plan Statement may be waived by the person entitled
thereto.

 EXHIBIT 10(L)

Exhibit 10(L)   

TARGET CORPORATION   

OFFICER INCOME CONTINUANCE
POLICY STATEMENT   

As Amended and Restated November 12,
2008   

I.                   CONCEPTS   

A.                 GENERAL   

The present policy of the Corporation is to
provide, under certain defined circumstances, Income Continuance Payments to
certain  Officers  or  Executives  whose employment is terminated at the
instance of the Corporation or who involuntarily or for good reason terminate
within two years after a Change in Control. This policy is intended to assist
in the occupational transition and financial security of those identified
Executives whose services are no longer deemed required within the Corporation,
who have during their tenure been faithful and honest employees, who do not
during the period of those payments engage in disqualifying misconduct, and to
the extent not compensated for services to a directly competitive employer and
to assist Executives who involuntarily or for good reason terminate employment
with the Corporation within two years after a Change in Control.  

This will be known as the Officer Income
Continuance Policy ( Officer-ICP ) of the Corporation. It will be interpreted
and applied in accordance with this Statement of policy and with any subsequent
amendment or restatement applicable to the Executive. The Corporation s Income
Continuance Policy Statement has been consolidated and transferred into the
Officer-ICP.  

The Officer-ICP has been operated in
compliance with Internal Revenue Code ( Code ) Section 409A since January 1,
2005.  Effective January 1, 2009,
the Officer-ICP has been amended to comply with Code Section 409A with
respect to all amounts payable from the Officer-ICP that are considered
nonqualified deferred compensation.  

B.                 ELIGIBILITY   

To be eligible under Officer-ICP, an
individual must be an Officer as specified in this Statement.  

C.                 REASSIGNMENT   

An Executive will continue to have income
protection under Officer-ICP for at least 12 calendar months (Eligibility
Period) after internal reassignment to a position which does not otherwise
include eligibility for Officer-ICP benefits.  

D.                 SPIN-OFF   

An Executive who is employed by a business
unit on the closing date of any Spin-Off which includes such business unit is
no longer eligible for Officer-ICP.  

E.                  DISQUALIFICATION
AND REDUCTION   

Serious and deliberate misconduct in
employment by an Executive resulting in discharge for cause can disqualify an
Executive from Officer-ICP eligibility. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Statement, after termination under Officer-ICP and normal windup of
former duties an Executive will not be required to perform any regular services
for the Corporation, and will be free to accept any other employment. Except as
otherwise provided in this Statement, Officer-ICP Payments otherwise payable to
an Executive will be reduced or excused in the amount of compensation from
Directly Competitive Employment as specifically defined to the Executive in
advance according to this Statement. An Executive otherwise entitled to
Officer-ICP Payments after Termination or Reassignment will be disqualified
from receiving future Payments by reason of serious and deliberate misconduct
which is unlawful or clearly and seriously harmful to the Corporation, or to
its interests.  

F.                  INTERPRETATION   

Subject to the express terms of this
Statement, the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation will have sole and
final authority to interpret the Officer-ICP and determine its application, and
will interpret it consistently. Section I of this Statement is intended as
a summary of the more detailed provisions of Section II. For that reason, Section II
will control in the event of any difference.  

II.                 APPLICATION   

A.                 ELIGIBILITY
PERIOD - DEFINITION   

The  Eligibility Period  of an Executive is
determined by the Executive s most recent Salary Grade on the Notice of
Termination or Reassignment by the Corporation; provided, however, in the event
of a downgrade or downgrades, the Eligibility Period of the Executive s highest
Salary Grade shall continue to be applicable until the expiration of the
Eligibility Period for that Salary Grade and then the Eligibility Period for
the next highest Salary Grade shall be used until it expires and this process
shall continue until the Eligibility Period for the last Salary Grade for which
this Statement covers expires. It will be calculated according to the following
schedule:  

2  

An Executive entitled to Officer-ICP Payments
will not be entitled to prepayment or other change in the payment schedule.  

B.                 ELIGIBILITY
PERIOD - USE   

The Eligibility Period of an Executive will
determine the number of consecutive calendar months for which an Executive
remains eligible for Officer-ICP Payments under this Statement after:  

1.                 Reassignment to a new
position within the Corporation which is not designated an Officer Position, or  

2.                 A downgrade as set forth in
A. above.  

C.                 PAYMENT PERIOD
- - DEFINITION   

The Payment Period for an Executive will
consist of the same number of months as the Executive s Eligibility Period,
measured from the time when Officer-ICP Payments first become payable to the
Executive under the terms of this Statement.  

D.                 PAYMENTS   

1.                  Amount   

Each monthly Officer-ICP amount during the
Payment Period will equal one twelfth (1/12) of the Executive s Final Annual
Cash Compensation from the Corporation which will consist of the sum of:  

a.                  Base Compensation   

The annual Base (regular monthly or other
fixed salary) rate payable as Cash Compensation to the Executive at the time of
Notice of Termination or effective date of Reassignment or downgrade, but in no
event less than the highest annual rate paid to the Executive at any time
during a number of months equal to the Executive s Eligibility Period
immediately before the Notice of Termination or effective date of Reassignment
or downgrade, and  

3  

b.                  Performance Bonus   

The average amount of the three annual
Performance Bonuses most recently paid or credited to the Executive as Cash
Compensation or deferred bonus, prior to Executive s Notice of Termination or
effective date of Reassignment or downgrade. For purposes of Officer-ICP, the
Performance Bonus of an Executive shall be determined according to the
applicable Short Term Incentive Plan of the Corporation, shall also include, if
applicable, any discretionary bonus paid during said applicable period on
account of the Executive s performance but outside of the purview of the then
applicable Short Term Incentive Plan.  

c.                  Adjustment   

The annual rate in dollars of each merit
increase awarded to an Executive before Notice of Termination will be included
in Base Compensation to determine the Executive s Officer-ICP Payments. If the
Executive s annual rate of Base Compensation at the time of Notice of
Termination has been increased or decreased to reflect a change from the Short
Term Incentive Plan used to determine the Performance Bonus defined above, and
the change is for the purpose of altering the future relationship of Bonus to
total Annual Cash Compensation of the Executive, then the dollar amount of that
increase or decrease in annual rate of Base Compensation will be excluded in
determining ICP Payments.  

d.                  Installment Payments   

Although the amount of an Executive s benefit
is determined on a monthly basis, such monthly amount shall be converted to and
made at the same frequency as the Corporation s standard payroll practices.
With respect to any benefit under Officer-ICP that is considered deferred
compensation pursuant to Code Section 409A, each installment payment shall
be considered a separate payment.  

2.                  Commencement   

Officer-ICP Payments, or entitlement to begin
receiving them, will commence after the Corporation has received a valid
unrevoked Release and Agreement from Executive, subject to any Set-offs,
Adjustments and Withholding as specified herein. Unless the Executive is a
Specified Employee, Officer-ICP Payments shall commence not later than ninety
(90) days following the date of the Executive s separation from service, as
defined under Code Section 409A. If at the time of the Executive s
separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A, the Executive
is a Specified Employee then no distribution of an Officer-ICP Payment that is
considered deferred compensation pursuant to Code Section 409A will be
made within 6 months of the separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A,
unless such Officer-ICP Payment would   

4  

otherwise be exempt from the requirements of
Code Section 409A. Any Officer-ICP Payments suspended during such 6 month
period will be paid at the time of the first Officer-ICP Payment after such 6
month period. The Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation, benefits
or perquisites, other than Officer-ICP Payments, after the date of the
Executive s separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A.  

3.                  Set-Off and
Withholding   

Officer-ICP Payments are not intended to
duplicate or be in addition to any other payment due between the Corporation
and the Executive.  

a.                  Reduction   

Each Payment otherwise due from the
Corporation to the Executive will be reduced, dollar for dollar and in timing
by all amounts which the Executive receives or is entitled to receive from the
Corporation or under a plan, program or agreement maintained by and at the
expense of the Corporation after the Employment Severance Date. This will
include but not be limited to legally required payments during any required
notice period or in connection with a plant closing, mass layoff, termination,
severance or redundancy under any law, regulation or order. This will also
include such sources as life and disability insurance. It will not apply to
accrued vacation or expense reimbursement (both will be paid in cash at
termination), pension proceeds, 401(k) proceeds, deferred compensation
plans, Social Security, equity awards (for example, stock options, performance
shares or restricted stock awards) or benefits payable under any Worker s
Compensation or similar law or regulation. Termination of employment by reason
of mandatory retirement under a lawful and uniform policy of the employer
applicable to the Executive will not be treated as a termination for
Officer-ICP purposes. In no circumstance whatsoever shall there be any
combination or duplication of any Officer-ICP Payments with any such other
legally required payment or payments which shall result in the Executive
receiving because of or due to termination of employment a combined total
amount from the Corporation which is greater than the amount of Officer-ICP
Payments to which Executive is entitled under this Officer-ICP before
accounting for such legally required other payments.  

b.                  Adjustments   

Taxes and other amounts which the Corporation
reasonably determines are required by law or by the Executive s written
instruction will be withheld from Officer-ICP amounts otherwise payable.  

5  

E.                  DEATH OF
EXECUTIVE   

If an Executive should die after Notice of
Termination and before completion of the Executive s Payment Period, the
remaining Payments will be made by the Corporation as follows, without
unnecessary interruption:  

1.                 Unless the Executive has
otherwise designated in unrevoked writing, acknowledged in writing by the CEO,
the surviving spouse of the Executive, if any, will be entitled to all
remaining Payments.  

2.                 If the Executive has
otherwise effectively designated in unrevoked writing, acknowledged in writing
by the CEO, then Payment will be made to or for the account of the person or
persons so designated as identified by the Corporation.  

3.                 In the absence of effective
prior written designation by the Executive and of a known surviving spouse, the
Corporation shall pay any remaining Payments to the Executive s estate.  

4.                 In the interest of providing
uninterrupted income to authorized beneficiaries of the Executive, any
Officer-ICP Payment made with reasonable care and in good faith by the
Corporation shall conclusively constitute Payment by the Corporation in
accordance with and satisfaction of the entitlement of the Executive and Executive s
beneficiaries under Officer-ICP. No interest or other charge shall be payable
by the Corporation or its representatives on any Payment delayed by the
Corporation to permit reasonable verification of authorized recipient(s).  

F.                  DISQUALIFICATION   

No Executive will be disqualified from
receipt of future Officer-ICP Payments by reason of any act or omission of
anyone other than the Executive or one or more persons acting pursuant to the
conscious and effective control of the Executive. Disqualification will be
interpreted as follows:  

1.                  While Employed
in the Corporation   

Deliberate and serious disloyal or dishonest
conduct in the course of employment will disqualify if it justifies and results
in prompt discharge for specific cause under the established policies and
practices of the Corporation as interpreted by the CEO for this purpose.
Examples would include material unlawful conduct, material and conscious
falsification or unauthorized disclosure of important records or reports,
embezzlement or unauthorized conversion of property, serious violation of
conflict of interest or vendor relations policies, and misuse or disclosure of
significant trade secrets or other information likely to be of use to the
detriment of the Corporation or its interests.  

6  

2.                  After Notice of
Termination   

The Officer-ICP will not restrict an
Executive s conduct or employment opportunities after Notice of Termination, or
any independent remedy of the Corporation or its representatives by reason of
the Executive s conduct while employed. The obligation of the Corporation to or
for an Executive during the Eligibility and Payment Periods can be terminated
only by the deliberate conduct of the Executive or one acting under the
Executive s conscious and effective control, and only as to any Officer-ICP
Payments not yet due, by reason of one or more of the following events:  

a.                 Unauthorized removal, use or
disclosure of strategic or operating plans, trade secrets, customer lists,
internal systems or other significant proprietary information of or concerning
the Corporation or its personnel, the use or disclosure of which is intended or
likely to cause loss or reduction of business advantage or substantial injury
to the Corporation or its management, business opportunities or interests.  

b.                 Expressing or endorsing
publication of untrue statements which are intended or likely to receive broad
public attention and to bring the Corporation or its interests, methods or
representatives into disrepute.  

c.                 Providing materially false
or misleading information concerning post-termination employment, or failure or
refusal promptly and accurately to provide required information, verification
or authorization required by the CEO as provided in this Statement and
affecting any Officer-ICP payment due from the Corporation.  

d.                 Solicitation of or an offer
to an employee within the Corporation to accept employment elsewhere, where the
selection of or offer to the recruited employee was based in the whole or in
part upon Executive s knowledge or experience concerning the employee which was
acquired by the Executive while employed within the Corporation or through one
or more personal acquaintances employed within the Corporation.  

e.                 Exercising the discretion,
authority or powers of an office or position held by an Executive after Notice
of Termination, and whether or not before an Employment Severance Date, unless
specifically authorized or directed in writing in advance by an authorized
executive of the Corporation.  

3.                  Preservation of
Rights   

Neither Officer-ICP nor its application shall
waive, excuse, preclude or otherwise affect any right or remedy which the
Corporation or any agent or representative of the Corporation may have,
individually or collectively, under law by reason of conduct of the Executive
during or after employment within   

7  

the Corporation. Disqualification or
reduction of Payments under Officer-ICP will be an additional and not an
exclusive remedy.  

G.                 COMPETITIVE
EMPLOYMENT   

An Executive will receive not less than the
full amount of the specified Officer-ICP Payments from the Employment Severance
Date through the full Payment Period whether or not compensated by another
employer for services in that period, unless disqualified under Section F.,
immediately above or as provided in this Section G. Compensation from
employment which is not identified as Directly Competitive Employment ( DCE )
will be in addition to and will not reduce any Officer-ICP Payment. If an
Executive engages in DCE as specifically defined in advance and by this
Statement, then each Officer-ICP Payment otherwise payable to the Executive
will be currently reduced, dollar for dollar and in timing, by the amount of
all Cash Compensation earned (whether on a current or deferred payment basis)
from that source during the Payment Period.  

These provisions will be interpreted and
administered as follows:  

1.                  Purpose of
Set-Off   

Reduction of Officer-ICP Payments by the
amount of Cash Compensation determined to be from DCE is not intended to
restrict or penalize an Executive s choice of alternative career opportunities,
but only to preserve and reconcile the personal income security intended to be
provided to Executives by Officer-ICP with the legitimate interests of the
Shareholders of the Corporation in its highly competitive business context.  

2.                  Competitors
Identified   

At or about the time of Notice of
Termination, the Corporation will inform the Executive in writing of those employers
who have been individually and specifically determined to offer DCE for
Officer-ICP purposes with respect to the Executive s former employment within
the Corporation. This designation will take into account existing operations
and known plans of the Corporation and of the employers listed, and will not
change during the Eligibility Period by reason of subsequent and mutually
unanticipated changes in the operations or plans of either.  

3.                  Criteria   

The following criteria will be employed in
determining and administering Officer-ICP application to DCE.  

a.                  Selective
Potential Detriment   

A position will not be determined to
constitute DCE for this purpose unless the CEO determines that the competitive
effectiveness of the   

8  

Executive and the new employer would be
materially enhanced by the Executive s current knowledge of such matters as the
particular methods, policies, customers, suppliers, personnel or plans of the
Corporation or its relevant business unit, as distinguished from the skills,
experience and services of the Executive generally. The Corporation will
identify for DCE purposes not more than five persons, firms or corporations who
are determined for this purpose to be the leading direct and immediate
competitors of the affected business of the Corporation.  

b.                  Preservation of
Employment Opportunities   

Whether or not an Executive s most recent
employment within the Corporation involved direct participation in the
management of one or more business units, this section will not be used to
discourage or penalize otherwise suitable employment opportunities in retailing
or otherwise. The Corporation may require, as a condition of avoiding DCE
designation for the Executive, a suitable written undertaking by the Executive
and the new employer that the Executive remains obliged not to use or divulge
trade secrets or proprietary information of the Corporation and that the
Executive will not volunteer or be expected or required to violate that
obligation in the course of the new employment.  

c.                  Relevant
Considerations   

In determining DCE, the CEO will give
suitable consideration to geographic, product and price-line marketing
overlaps, the nature and content of the Executive s particular knowledge of
strategies and plans within the Corporation, and the extent to which the
Executive s knowledge, as distinguished from skills, is likely to be a
significant factor in generating an employment opportunity. Employment
exclusively with a component of a larger business entity, which component is
not presently or known to be planned to be a direct and immediate competitor of
the Executive s former business unit, will not be treated as DCE merely because
one or more other components of that entity is or may become a competitor of
the Corporation or one or more of its business units.  

4.                  Officer-ICP
Payment Reduction   

Uniform and responsible administration of
Officer-ICP will require reliable information and verification to the
Corporation.  

a.                  Reporting   

To be eligible for any Officer-ICP Payment
during a period of DCE, an Executive must, in addition to all other required
reporting, provide to the Corporation in writing an accurate statement of the
amount and payment schedule of all Cash Compensation or its equivalent to be
received from   

9  

the new DCE employer and of any subsequent
change or correction of that amount, in such form and with such verification as
the CEO may request in writing. An Executive will not be or become entitled to
receive or retain any portion of any Officer-ICP Payment on account of any
Payment Period for which that information, and any required verification, is
not currently and accurately provided.  

b.                  Verification and
Reconciliation   

Required verification may include
authorization for written confirmation from the employer and confidential
disclosure of completed W-2, payroll and income tax forms of the Executive on
which taxes have been or will be paid. If the Corporation withholds for more
than 30 days any Officer-ICP Payment pending receipt of required information or
verification which is later received and found satisfactory, the Corporation
will pay interest at a realistic rate determined by the CEO for the period of
delay. The Corporation and the Executive will each fairly and promptly adjust
by payment any discrepancy later discovered between reported and actual Cash
Compensation of the Executive, but the Corporation will have no liability for
any amount not claimed by an Executive in writing before final expiration of
the Executive s Payment Period.  

H.                 REASSIGNMENT
AND SPIN-OFF   

1.                  Reassignment
and Other Adjustments   

The Corporation may transfer an Executive to
another position within the Corporation or reduce the Executive s Base
Compensation in Executive s current position (collectively referred to as  Reassignment ).
An Executive in the case of either event may elect Officer-ICP Payments if the
Executive s total monetary compensation after Reassignment will be measurably
and substantially below the total monetary compensation of the Executive
immediately before notice of Reassignment. For this purpose, total monetary
compensation will include salary and bonus and continuation, or payment of the
substantial equivalent in Cash Compensation, of all non-cash personal benefits
and perquisites which the Executive was receiving immediately before and does
not receive after the Reassignment and which are susceptible of accurate and
objective measurement in dollars as determined by the CEO. An Executive who
elects Officer-ICP Payments must terminate employment with the Corporation
within thirty (30) days after notice of Reassignment to be eligible for such
payments.  

2.                  Spin-Off   

An Executive who is employed by a business
unit on the closing date of any Spin-Off that includes such business unit is no
longer eligible for Officer-ICP. A Spin-Off will be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of this paragraph whether or not afterward: (a) the Executive has
a personal ownership or incentive interest in the severed business unit or
operation; or (b) the severed   

10  

business unit or operation becomes, as a
result of or after the severance, a part of one or more other legal entity or
entities.  

I.                   REPORTING   

For convenience and uniformity of
administration, each Executive while eligible for or entitled to Officer-ICP
Payments after Notice of Termination will be expected as a pre-condition
currently and accurately to inform the Corporation in writing of the name and
business address of each employer of Executive during the Eligibility and
Payment Periods, including a summary description of the nature and principal
business locations of the new employer and the title, principal duties, address
and telephone number of the Executive. Significant changes in employment,
duties or location will also be promptly reported. The Corporation will not be
required to make any Officer-ICP Payment for any period for which it has not
received a current and accurate report as required by, or by the CEO in
accordance with, this Statement.  

J.                  INTERPRETATION   

1.                 Any decision of the CEO will
be: (1) Final and conclusive of the rights and obligations of all affected
parties and (2) Applied uniformly as to all Executives then similarly situated
(subject to subsequent Officer-ICP amendment); and (3) Not subject to
separate determination or review by any public or private agency or authority
except as expressly provided in this Statement.  

2.                 References to compensation
and other monetary rates or measurements in this Statement and its applications
are in current dollars, unadjusted by reason of inflation, deflation or
otherwise.  

3.                 Any portion of a full
calendar month or year will be prorated on a full calendar basis, without
differential related to such considerations as working days or holidays. Any
portion of a day will be treated as a full day, and measurement days will begin
and end at midnight, current time. The fiscal year of the Corporation will be
treated for all purposes as it is for financial reporting purposes.  

4.                 In the event of application
or interpretation of Officer-ICP to an individual Executive who is a Director
of the Corporation, or otherwise in its sole discretion, the Board of Directors
of the Corporation or its authorized committee shall have and may exercise the
sole, exclusive and final authority and discretion of the CEO for any purpose
under Officer-ICP.  

K.                 RELEASE   

Payment and receipt of Officer-ICP Payments
will be in full and final satisfaction of all claims by or through an Executive
against the Corporation and its representatives by reason of the employment of
the Executive and its termination, except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Statement or as required by applicable law or regulation. A signed and unrevoked
written Release to that effect, in form approved by the CEO, will   

11  

be delivered by the Executive
or the Executive s representative to the Corporation before any Officer-ICP
Payment will become payable by the Corporation to or on account of the
Executive. Such Release must be delivered to the Corporation within 60 days of
the date of Executive s separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A.
The Release may, without limitation, require a representation that no
confidential documents concerning the Corporation or its intentions have been
or will be removed or retained by the Executive without specific authority, and
that the Executive will not engage in disqualifying misconduct as defined in
this Statement, in reference to the Corporation. The Release will not affect
any conversion, vested or continuing rights available to an Executive under a
plan of the Corporation other than Officer-ICP.  

L.                                          GENERAL  

The Officer-ICP and this
Statement will not constitute or infer an obligation or undertaking to employ
any person for any future period of time or in any specific position.
Officer-ICP Eligibility or Payments after Notice of Termination will not
create, continue or evidence any employment relationship with the Corporation.
All employment privileges, benefits and perquisites not expressly and in
writing reserved to an Executive under Officer-ICP will terminate on Executive s
separation from service, as defined under Code Section 409A, unless
otherwise expressly agreed in advance in writing by the Corporation. This will
not affect any conversion, vested or other continuing benefits or rights
available to an Executive under a plan of the Corporation other than
Officer-ICP.  

M.                                     AMENDMENT  

Officer-ICP and this Statement
may not be terminated and may not be amended to reduce benefits with respect an
Executive subject to the Officer-ICP until twelve months after the Executive
receives written notice of the proposed termination or amendment. Except as set
forth in the first sentence hereof, Officer-ICP and this Statement can be
amended (including modification, restatement, suspension and termination) at
any time, without prior written notice to or consultation with any Executive,
by the Board of Directors or any committee appointed by the Board of Directors
having the authority of the Board for that purpose. Any such change will have
effect as follows:  

1.                                           Effective
Date of Change  

Except as set forth below, any
amendment will be effective on the date of its adoption by the Board or
committee or such other such subsequent date or dates as may be specified in
the amendment or the resolution by which it is adopted. Unless otherwise
mutually agreed in writing by the parties, (a) an amendment or termination
will have no effect upon any Executive who at the time has received Notice of
Termination under Officer-ICP and (b) a termination or an amendment that
reduces benefits will not be effective as to an Executive subject to the
Officer-ICP until twelve months after the Executive receives written notice of
the termination or amendment.  

12  

2.                                           Notice
of Amendment  

The Corporation will promptly
after any amendment provide to each Executive then eligible for Officer-ICP
benefits a written statement of Officer-ICP as amended, and no amendment will
be effective as to an Executive until the later of the date the Executive
receives such written statement, or twelve months after notice as provided in 1
above. An Executive will be deemed to have received the written statement if it
is delivered to the Executive in person, or after 48 hours following its hand
delivery or dispatch by mail or other suitable means of delivery to the last
known address of the Executive.  

3.                                           Acquiescence  

An amendment will apply in full
to an Executive if mutually agreed in writing by the Executive and the
Corporation, or if the Executive or the Executive s representative knowingly
receives a benefit or improvement under Officer-ICP as amended which would not
have been available without the amendment. If any such benefit from an
amendment is knowingly received by an Executive with the consent of the
Corporation, then all elements of that amendment and all prior Officer-ICP
Statements and amendments then currently in effect will also be applicable to
the Executive.  

4.                                           Adjustment  

A change in or addition or
deletion of any benefit or perquisite plan or program of the Corporation
applicable to an Executive may be expressly made subject to prior written
agreement by the Executive upon a corresponding change in the interpretation or
application of Officer-ICP to the Executive, to prevent redundant or other
unintended benefits or detriments to the Executive or the Corporation which
might otherwise result.  

5.                                           Change
in Control  

No amendment or termination
that would adversely affect the benefits or protections under the Officer-ICP
of any eligible Executive as of the date of such amendment or termination shall
be effective as to such individual unless no Change in Control occurs within
twelve (12) months of the adoption of such amendment or termination, and any
such attempted amendment or termination adopted within twelve (12) months prior
to a Change in Control shall retroactively be null and void from the date of
adoption as it relates to all such Executives who were eligible for benefits
under the Officer-ICP prior to such adoption.  

For two (2) years after a
Change in Control, the Officer-ICP and this Statement may not be amended in any
manner that would adversely affect the benefits or protections under the
Officer-ICP of the Executives who are eligible for benefits under the
Officer-ICP at the time of the Change in Control.  

13  

N.                                        APPLICABLE
LAW  

It is intended that the
decision of the CEO, as specified in the Officer-ICP statement, will be
exclusive and final with respect to any application or interpretation of
Officer-ICP. If any body of law should be used or applied in determining the
meaning or effect of Officer-ICP, in the interest of consistency this will be
deemed an agreement made and executed in the State of Minnesota and the law of
the State of Minnesota will control to the extent not preempted by federal law.

voting stock (or comparable voting equity interests) of the surviving or
acquiring entity resulting from such Business Combination (including such
beneficial ownership of an entity that, as a result of such transaction, owns
Target or all or substantially all of Target s assets either directly or
through one or more subsidiaries), in substantially the same proportions (as
compared to the other beneficial owners of Target s Voting Stock immediately

P.                                          CHANGE
IN CONTROL  

Other provisions of this
Statement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event of a Change in Control:  

1.                                          If
an Executive s employment with the Corporation is terminated, whether
involuntarily or by the Executive for  good reason  (as defined in Section II.P.5),
within two years following a Change in Control, an Executive shall be eligible
for Officer-ICP Payments. 

17  

2.                                          To
the extent the Officer ICP-Payments are not subject to Code Section 409A
(including pursuant to a short-term deferral exception under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and separation pay plan exception
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)), or such Change in
Control qualifies as a  change in control event  under Code Section 409A,
the Officer-ICP Payments shall be made in a lump sum payment within 20 days of
the Executive s separation of service, as defined under Code Section 409A;
provided that if the Executive is a Specified Employee, the distribution of any
such Officer-ICP Payments subject to Code Section 409A will be made 6
months after the separation of service, as defined under Code Section 409A.  The lump sum amount shall be determined by
discounting the periodic Officer-ICP Payments by a rate equivalent to the
annual prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the first business
day following the Officer-ICP Payments. 

3.                                          To
the extent the Officer-ICP Payments are subject to Code Section 409A,
(after considering any exceptions to Code Section 409A, including the
short-term deferral exception under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and
separation pay plan exception under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9))  and such Change in Control does not qualify
as a change in control event under Code Section 409A, the Officer-ICP
Payments shall be made according to the payment schedule set forth in Section II.D
of this Statement; provided that if the Executive is a Specified Employee, the
distribution of any such Officer-ICP Payments subject to Code Section 409A
will be made 6 months after Executive s separation from service, as defined
under Code Section 409A. 

4.                                          Except
for the Release required by Section II.K of this Statement, all other
obligations or restrictions of Executive under this Statement shall terminate. 

5.                                          For
purposes of this Section II.P,  good reason  shall mean any material diminution
of the Executive s position, authority, duties or responsibilities (including
the assignment of duties materially inconsistent with the Executive s position
or a material increase in the time Executive is required by the Corporation or
its successor to travel), any reduction in salary or in the Executive s
aggregate bonus and incentive opportunities, any material reduction in the
aggregate value of the Executive s employee benefits (including retirement,
welfare and fringe benefits), or relocation to a principal work site that is
more than 40 miles from the Executive s principal work site immediately prior
to the Change in Control. 

6.                                          If
an Executive s employment was terminated prior to a Change in Control, such
Executive is receiving or is entitled to receive Officer-ICP Payments that will
continue after the Change in Control, and the Change in Control qualified as a  change
in control event  for purposes of Code Section 409A, then, subject to the
six month delay for Specified Employees in effect under Section II.D.2,
the Officer-ICP Payments due after such change in control event will be
accelerated and paid to Executive in a lump sum as soon as practicable, but not
more than  

18  

90 days following such change
in control event. The lump sum under this Section II.P.6 will be
calculated in the same manner as the lump sum calculated under Section II.P.2
above.  

Q.                                        CERTAIN
REDUCTION OF PAYMENTS BY THE CORPORATION  

1.                                          Anything
in this Officer-ICP to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this Section Q
shall apply to an Executive if the Auditor determines that each of a and b
below are applicable. 

a.                                          Payments
hereunder, determined without application of this Section Q, either alone
or together with other payments in the nature of compensation to the Executive
which are contingent on or accelerated by a change in the ownership or
effective control of the Corporation, or in the ownership of a substantial
portion of the assets of the Corporation, or otherwise, would result in any
portion of the payments hereunder being subject to an excise tax on excess
parachute payments imposed under Code Section 4999. 

b.                                         The
excise tax imposed on the Executive under Section 4999 of the Code on
excess parachute payments, from whatever source, would result in a lesser net
aggregate present value of payments and distributions to the Executive (after
subtraction of the excise tax) than if payments and distributions to the
Executive were reduced to the maximum amount that could be made without
incurring the excise tax. 

2.                                          Under
this Section Q the payments under this Officer-ICP shall be reduced (but
not below zero) so that the present value of such payments and distributions
shall equal the Reduced Amount. The  Reduced Amount  (which may be zero) shall
be an amount expressed as the present value of the payments and distributions
under this Officer-ICP that can be made without causing such payments and
distributions to be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code. To the extent necessary, the reductions in the payments and distributions
will be applied to those Officer-ICP payments nearest the Employment Severance
Date until the full amount of the necessary reductions have been applied. The
determinations and reductions under this Section Q shall be made before
any eliminations or reductions, if any, have been made under the Corporation s
Long Term Incentive Plan. 

3.                                          If
the Auditor determines that this Section Q is applicable to an Executive,
it shall so advise the Corporation. The Corporation shall then promptly give
the Executive notice to that effect together with a copy of the detailed
calculation supporting such determination which shall include a statement of
the Reduced Amount. Such notice shall also include a description of which and
how much of the payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such
election the aggregate present value of the payments equals the Reduced
Amount.) For purposes of this Section Q, present value shall be determined
in accordance with  

19  

Section 280G of the Code.
All the foregoing determinations made by the Auditor under this Section Q
shall be made as promptly as practicable after it is determined that parachute
payments will be made to the Executive if an elimination or reduction is not
made. As promptly as practicable following the election hereunder, the
Corporation shall pay to or for the benefit of the Executive such amounts as
are then due to the Executive under this Officer-ICP and shall promptly pay to
or for the benefit of the Executive in the future such amounts as become due to
the Executive under this Officer-ICP.  

4.                                          As
a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code
at the time of the initial determination by the Auditor hereunder, it is
possible that payments under this Officer-ICP will have been made which should
not have been made ( Overpayment ) or that additional payments which will have
not been made could have been made ( Underpayment ), in each case, consistent
with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the
Auditor, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue
Service against the Corporation or the Executive which the Auditor believes has
a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made,
any such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the
Executive which the Executive shall repay together with interest at the
applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the
Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by the Executive if
and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to
the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the
Auditor, based upon controlling precedent, determines that an Underpayment has
occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid to or for the benefit of
the Executive together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for
in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code. 

5.                                          In
making its determination under this Section Q, the value of any non-cash
benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of
Section 280G(d)(3) of the Code. 

6.                                          All
determinations made by the Auditor under this Section Q shall be binding
upon the Corporation and the Executive.

CLAIMS PROCEDURE    

   for
the   

   Target
Corporation   

   Officer
Income Continuance Policy Statement   

When your employment with Target Corporation
(the  Company ) terminates, the Company will tell you whether you are eligible
for benefits from the above-referenced plan and, if so, the amount and timing
of the payments that will be made to you.  

If you believe that the Company s
determination is incorrect in any way, you must file a written claim with the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Chief Executive Officer or his or
her delegate ordinarily will respond to the claim within 90 days of the date on
which it is received. However, if special circumstances require an extension of
the period of time for processing a claim, the 90-day period can be extended
for an additional 90 days by giving you written notice of the extension and the
reason that the extension is necessary.  

If the claim for a benefit is approved, you
will receive written notice of the amount of your benefit and the date on which
payments will begin. If your claim is denied in whole or in part, you will be
told in writing the specific reasons for the decision and will receive an
explanation of the procedures for reviewing the decision.  

If you do not agree with the decision, you
can request that the Chief Executive Officer reconsider his or her decision by
filing a written request for review within 60 days after receiving notice that
the claim has been denied. You or your representative can also present written
statements which explain why you believe that the benefit claimed should be
paid and may review all pertinent plan documents.  

Generally, the decision will be reviewed
within 60 days after the Chief Executive Officer receives a request for
reconsideration. However, if special circumstances require a delay, the review
may take up to 120 days. (If a decision cannot be made within the 60-day period,
you will be notified of this fact in writing.) You will receive a written
notice of the decision which will explain the reasons for the decision by
making specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the decision is
based.  

These Claims Procedures must be followed
before you can file a lawsuit seeking recovery of any Officer-ICP Payments to
which you claim to be entitled.

participants and their beneficiaries in such manner and at such times as
specified in the Plans;  

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall
constitute an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of any Plan
as an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred
compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
( ERISA   

WHEREAS, it is the intention of Company to make contributions to the
Trust and to cause contributions to be made to the Trust by other Employers to

liabilities under the Plans;  

WHEREAS, Company and Trustee previously entered into a Trust Agreement
effective January 1, 2005;  

1  

WHEREAS, it is the intention of Company to amend the Trust Agreement to
comply with Internal Revenue Code section 409A;  

WHEREAS the parties have agreed to amend and restate the Trust
Agreement in its entirety to read as set forth herein;  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do hereby amend and restate the Trust and
agree that the Trust shall hereafter be comprised, held and disposed of as
follows:  

Section 1.   Maintenance of Trust .   

(a)                       Company has previously deposited
with Trustee in trust certain amounts which currently constitute the principal
of the Trust and shall continue to be held, administered and disposed of by
Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement along with such additional
contributions as may be deposited with Trustee in the future. 

(b)                      The Trust hereby established shall
be irrevocable, except to the extent provided in Section 4. 

(c)                       The Trust is intended to be a
grantor trust, of which each Employer is the grantor with respect to the
portion attributable to its contributions, within the meaning of
subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1, subtitle A
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be construed
accordingly.  Company or another Employer
shall pay any and all federal, state or local taxes on the Trust, or any part
thereof, and on the income of the Trust to the extent not paid by the assets of
the Trust. 

(d)                      The principal of the Trust, and any
earnings thereon shall be held separate and apart from other funds of the
Employers and shall be used exclusively for the uses and purposes of Plan participants
and their beneficiaries and general creditors as herein set forth.  Plan participants and their beneficiaries
shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership interest in, any
assets of the Trust.  Any rights created
under the Plans and this Trust Agreement shall be unsecured contractual rights
of Plan participants and their beneficiaries against the Employers.  Any assets held by the Trust which are
attributable to the contributions made by a particular Employer will be subject
to the claims of that Employer s general creditors under federal and state law
in the event of Insolvency, as defined in Section 3(a) herein. 

(e)                       Company, in its sole discretion,
may at any time, or from time to time, make (or cause other Employers to make)
additional deposits of cash or other eligible property in trust with Trustee to
augment the principal to be held, administered and disposed of by Trustee as
provided in this Trust Agreement. 
Neither Trustee nor any Plan participant or beneficiary shall have any
right to compel such additional deposits. 
Such deposits to the Trust will be subject to the following rules: 

2  

(1)                          Company,
and other Employers, shall not make deposits of cash or eligible property solely
on the basis of a change in the Company s (or respective Employer s) financial
health. 

(2)                          Company,
and other Employers, will not make deposits of cash or eligible property to the
extent restricted by Internal Revenue Code section 409A(b)(3). 

(f)                        The following
provisions shall apply in the event of an actual or potential Change of Control
as defined in Section 13(d): 

(1)                          In the
event there is scheduled a duly called shareholders meeting of Company with
respect to which (i) any person or entity has filed a definitive proxy
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission soliciting proxies to
effect at such meeting a Change of Control of the nature described in Section 13(d)(1) (a
 Change of Board Control ) or (ii) Company has included in a definitive
proxy statement of Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
nominees of one or more persons or entities for election to the Board of
Directors whose election is opposed by the Board of Directors but the election
of whom would constitute a Change of Board Control, each Employer shall make
contributions to the Trust, no sooner than three business days or later than
one business day prior to the scheduled date of the meeting, of cash or other
eligible property which, together with amounts attributable to its previous
contributions to the Trust, have a value equal to the amount required under
paragraph (5), unless the Board of Directors of Company determines in its sole
discretion, not later than three business days prior to the scheduled date of
the meeting, that the Trust shall not be funded and provides a written notice
to the Employer of that determination prior to the time the Employer makes the
contribution.  However, no such
contribution shall be made pursuant to this paragraph (1) if, prior to the
time the Employer makes any such contribution, a written settlement agreement
is entered into with Company or the nominations of nominees are otherwise
withdrawn in such a manner that a Change of Board Control will not be further
pursued or effected at such meeting. 

(2)                          In the
event a Change of Control that does not constitute a Change of Board Control,
or any offer or written agreement of the nature hereinafter described in clause
(i) that, if completed or consummated, would constitute a Change of
Control, occurs prior to any Change of Board Control, each Employer, as
promptly as practicable, but not sooner than 20 days (subject to extension as
hereinafter provided) and not later than 30 days (subject to extension as
hereinafter provided) after a public announcement of (i) any offer to
acquire beneficial ownership of Voting Stock (as defined in Article IV of
the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of Company) or of any
written agreement that would result in a Change of Control pursuant to Section 13(d)(2) or
(3) if the offer is completed or the agreement is consummated or (ii) the
occurrence of any Change of Control other than a Change of Board Control (the  Contribution 

3  

Period ), shall make contributions to the Trust of cash or other
eligible property which, together with amounts attributable to its previous
contributions to the Trust, have a value equal to the amount required under
paragraph (5), unless the Board of Directors determines, in its sole
discretion, that funding of the Trust shall not occur and provides a written
notice to the Employer of that determination prior to the earlier of (X) the
time the Employer makes the contribution or (Y) a Change of Board
Control.  At any time prior to the
commencement of the Contribution Period (or any extension of such commencement
date made in accordance with this sentence), the Board of Directors (if no
Change of Board Control shall have occurred), in its sole discretion, may extend
the commencement date and/or the duration of the Contribution Period (or any
previous extension of either thereof) by written notice to the Employers.  However, no such contribution shall be made
pursuant to this paragraph (2) if, prior to the time the Employer makes
any such contribution, no Change of Control has occurred and the offer or
agreement that, if completed or consummated, would result in a Change of
Control is terminated.  

(3)                          Any written
notice from the Board of Directors relating to a contribution pursuant to
paragraph (1) or (2) may be modified or withdrawn by a later dated
written notice of the Board of Directors delivered at any time or from time to
time prior to the earlier of (i) the time such contribution is made or (ii) the
end of the last day on which the original notice could have been given in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2). 

(4)                          Neither
Trustee nor any Plan participant or beneficiary shall have any right to compel
any contributions under this subsection (f) or to compel any Employer or
the Board of Directors to take any action under this subsection.  In deciding whether or not to take any action
authorized under this subsection (f), the Board of Directors shall have no fiduciary
or other duty to participants and beneficiaries. 

(5)                          If the
Trust is to be funded pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), the amount of each
Employer s contribution shall be 120% of the amount determined by the General
Counsel and the Chief Financial Officer of Company, in their sole discretion,
to be sufficient to pay the present value of the Employer s total projected
liability under the Plans with respect to participants employed or formerly
employed by that Employer or their beneficiaries, plus two percent of such
amount as a reserve for payment of Trustee fees and expenses of the Trust.  The determination of an Employer s  total
projected liability  under a Plan for purposes of this paragraph shall be made
utilizing the definition specified in Appendix B applicable to the Plan, if
any, and otherwise by utilizing the assumptions prescribed in Section 13(e). 

4  

(6)                          On or
before the date of a contribution made pursuant to this subsection (f), each
Employer shall deliver to the Trustee a schedule showing its best estimate of
the aggregate amount of benefits payable by it under each Plan. 

(g)                     In the event of
a final and unappealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or
the U. S. Department of Labor that one or more Plans do not satisfy the
requirements for being maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees for purposes of Title I of ERISA, Trustee shall immediately
segregate the assets attributable to such Plan or Plans into a separate
Trust.  Said separate Trust shall
continue to be held and administered by Trustee in accordance with this
Agreement until the provisions applicable to the separate Trust are amended
pursuant to Section 12. 

(h)                     For purposes of
this Trust,  eligible property  means property in one or more of the following
categories: 

(1)                          Cash. 

(2)                          Treasury or
other government agency securities not exceeding one year in maturity. 

(3)                          Money
market securities. 

(4)                          An
ownership interest in the Target Corporation Credit Card Master Trust, which
may be evidenced by, among other things, a participation or certificates. 

(5)                          Corporate
owned life insurance policies 

(6)                          In the
event that the total of the property available under paragraphs (1) through
(4) is not sufficient to provide the entire contribution to be made by an
Employer under subsection (f),  eligible property  shall also include
unencumbered real property owned by the Employer with a fair market value that
is at least equal to the additional amount necessary to provide the entire
contribution that is to be made. 

The fair market value of the property to be contributed under
paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subsection shall be determined by
the General Counsel and the Chief Financial Officer of Company in their sole
discretion, taking into account any reduction in that value that could result
from the lack of an orderly liquidation of a particular item or items of
property.  

5  

Section 2.   Payments to Plan Participants and Their
Beneficiaries .   

(a)  

(1)                          As soon as
reasonably possible after a Change of Control occurs that results in funding of
the Trust under Section 1(f) (provided that the funding has not been
returned to the Employers pursuant to Section 4), Company s Director of
Executive Compensation (or his or her successor) shall deliver to Trustee a
Payment Schedule showing the amount payable to each Plan participant or
beneficiary under each Plan. 

(i)                           The Payment Schedule will
provide the amount payable, determined as of the date of the Change of Control,
as well as the method and rate to credit earnings on such amounts, if any,
until amounts are paid to the Plan participant, and the date on which the
amounts are payable. 

(ii)                        The Payment Schedule shall, with
respect to any amounts subject to Internal Revenue Code section 409A, only
provide for payments under an allowable distribution event under Code section
409A.  The Payment Schedule shall reflect
the time and form of distribution as provided under the respective Plan. 

(2)                          Except as
otherwise provided in subsection (c), Trustee shall make payments to the Plan
participants and their beneficiaries in accordance with such Payment Schedule,
and may rely conclusively on such Payment Schedule in making payments. 

(3)                          Trustee
shall make provision for the reporting and withholding of any federal, state or
local taxes that may be required to be withheld with respect to the payment of
benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plans and shall pay amounts withheld to
the appropriate taxing authorities or determine that such amounts have been
reported, withheld and paid by the Employers. 
Trustee may rely on instructions from Company as to any required
withholding and shall be fully protected hereunder in relying on such
instructions.  For purposes of the
preceding sentence, a failure by Company to provide any instructions as to
required withholding may be deemed by Trustee to be an instruction by Company
that no withholding is required. 

(b)                     Prior to a
Change of Control described in subsection (a), the entitlement of a Plan
participant or his or her beneficiaries to benefits under the Plans shall be
determined by Company or such party as it shall designate under the Plans, and
any claim for such benefits shall be considered and reviewed under the
procedures set out in the Plans.  Company
shall make (or cause other Employers to make) payment of benefits directly to
Plan participants or their beneficiaries as they become due under the terms of
the Plans,  

6  

and Trustee shall have no obligation to make such payments prior to
such Change of Control.  

(c)                      In the event of
a dispute over a payment under subsection (a) following a Change of
Control, a participant or beneficiary who claims to be entitled to a larger
payment from the Plans than shown in the Payment Schedule may submit a written
claim for payment to Trustee within 90 days from the date the payment was
otherwise scheduled to be made.  The
claim shall be processed as follows: 

(1)                          Trustee
shall give notice of the claim to Company. 
If Trustee receives no notice of response from Company within 30 days
after the date Company is given the notice of claim, Trustee shall pay the
participant or beneficiary the amount claimed from the assets in the Trust held
on behalf of such participant.  If a
notice of response is received within such 30 days, Trustee shall consider the
claim, including Company s response.  If
the merits of the claim depend on compensation, service or other data in the
possession of Company and such information is not provided to Trustee by
Company, Trustee may rely upon information provided by the participant or
beneficiary. 

(2)                          Trustee
shall give notice to the participant or beneficiary and Company of its decision
on the claim, which shall be made within any period applicable to the
particular Plan.  The participant or
beneficiary shall then pursue the appeals procedure for the Plan, if any, if he
or she wishes to contest Trustee s decision. 
Either the participant or beneficiary (after any applicable claims
procedure has been exhausted) or Company may challenge Trustee s decision by
filing suit in a court of competent jurisdiction.  If no such suit is filed within 60 days after
notice of Trustee s decision (and exhaustion of any applicable appeals
procedure provided for a Plan), the decision shall become final and binding on
all parties.  If the decision is to grant
the claim, Trustee shall make payment to the participant or beneficiary of the
appropriate amount; provided, however, that the amount of any distribution from
the Trust shall not exceed the total amount of assets held in the Trust on
behalf of such participant. 

(3)                          Trustee may
decline to decide a claim and may file suit to have the matter resolved by a
court of competent jurisdiction.  All of
Trustee s expenses in the court proceeding, including attorneys  fees, shall be
allowed as administrative expenses of the Trust. 

(4)                          In the
event of a dispute to be resolved under this subsection (c), Trustee may retain
a third party to review the calculations and the payment amounts and advise
Trustee as to the correct amount to be paid. 
All expenses of such a third party shall be allowed as administrative
expenses of the Trust. 

(d)                     If payment is
made to a participant or beneficiary under this Section 2, the obligation
of the Employers under the terms of the applicable Plan or Plans shall be
extinguished to  

7  

the extent of the amount paid. 
Trustee has no obligation to make payments to a participant or
beneficiary from the Trust under this Section 2 except to the extent
amounts have been contributed to the Trust with respect to such person.  

Section 3.   Trustee Responsibility Regarding Payments
When Employer is Insolvent .   

(a)                      Trustee shall
cease payment of benefits to Plan participants and their beneficiaries
attributable to a particular Employer if the Employer is Insolvent.  An Employer shall be considered  Insolvent 
for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i) it is unable to pay its debts
as they become due, or (ii) it is subject to a pending proceeding as a
debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code. 

(b)                     At all times
during the continuance of this Trust, as provided in Section 1(d) hereof,
the principal and income of the Trust attributable to a particular Employer
shall be subject to claims of general creditors of that Employer under federal
and state law as set forth below. 

(1)                          The Board
of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of Company shall have the duty to
certify to Trustee in writing of an Employer s Insolvency.  If a person claiming to be a creditor of an
Employer alleges in writing to Trustee that an Employer has become Insolvent,
Trustee shall determine whether an Employer is Insolvent and, pending such
determination, Trustee shall discontinue payment of benefits to its Plan
participants or their beneficiaries. 

(2)                          Unless
Trustee has actual knowledge of an Employer s Insolvency, or has received
notice from Company or a person claiming to be a creditor alleging that an
Employer is Insolvent, Trustee shall have no duty to inquire whether an
Employer is Insolvent.  Trustee may in
all events rely on such evidence concerning each Employer s solvency as may be
furnished to Trustee and that provides Trustee with a reasonable basis for
making a determination concerning solvency. 

(3)                          If at any
time Trustee has determined that an Employer is Insolvent, Trustee shall
discontinue payments to Plan participants or their beneficiaries and shall hold
the assets of the Trust attributable to that Employer for the benefit of the
Employer s general creditors.  Nothing in
this Trust Agreement shall in any way diminish any rights of Plan participants
or their beneficiaries to pursue their rights as general creditors of Company
with respect to benefits due under the Plans or otherwise. 

(4)                          Trustee
shall resume the payment of benefits to Plan participants or their
beneficiaries in accordance with Section 2 of this Trust Agreement only
after Trustee has determined that an Employer is not Insolvent (or is no longer
Insolvent). 

8  

(c)          Provided that there are
sufficient assets, if Trustee discontinues the payment of benefits from the
Trust pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof and subsequently resumes such
payments, the first payment following such discontinuance shall include the
aggregate amount of all payments due to the affected Plan participants or their
beneficiaries under the terms of the Plans for the period of such
discontinuance, less the aggregate amount of any payments made to Plan
participants or their beneficiaries by Company or another Employer in lieu of
the payments provided for hereunder during any such period of discontinuance. 

Section 4.  Payments to Employers .   

Except as provided in Section 3 or this
Section, Company shall have no right or power to direct Trustee to return to
Company or another Employer or to divert to others any of the Trust assets
before all payments of benefits have been made to Plan participants and their
beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of the Plans and all other obligations of
the Trust, including fees and expenses of Trustee, have been paid. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence or anything else in this Trust Agreement to the
contrary, if any Employer is required to contribute assets to the Trust in
accordance with Section 1(f), Trustee shall return such assets plus the
earnings attributable to the assets to the Employer upon receipt of
notification from the Board of Directors that it has determined that the
anticipated Change of Control will not occur and determination by Trustee that
a Change of Control has not in fact occurred.  

Section 5.  Investment Authority .   

(a)          In no event may Trustee
invest in assets other than eligible property as defined in Section 1(h). All
rights associated with assets of the Trust shall be exercised by Trustee or the
person designated by Trustee, and shall in no event be exercisable by or rest
with Plan participants. 

(b)         Company shall have the
right, at any time, and from time to time in its sole discretion, to substitute
assets of equal fair market value for any asset held by the Trust, provided
that the substitute assets also qualify as eligible property under Section 1(h)  
(1) through (5). 

(c)          Trustee shall hold, manage,
invest and otherwise administer the Trust pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The Trustee shall be responsible only for contributions actually
received by it hereunder. The amount of each contribution made by the Employers
to the Trust shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Executive
Committee or other persons allocated that responsibility herein, and Trustee
shall have no duty or responsibility with respect thereto. Except as otherwise
specifically agreed to by Trustee, Trustee shall not be responsible for the
administration of any Plan (including without limitation the determination of
Plan participation rights of employees of the Employers and the determination
of benefits of the participants in any Plan). Except to the extent that Trustee
has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Trustee shall not be responsible,
directly or indirectly, for the investment or reinvestment of the assets of the

9  

Trust, which investment and reinvestment
shall be the sole responsibility of Company; provided, however, that upon a
Change of Control, Trustee shall become responsible for the investment and
reinvestment of the assets of the Trust as elsewhere provided herein. Prior to
a Change of Control, and unless Company and Trustee have mutually agreed in a
separate writing that Trustee shall have and exercise investment discretion, in
either case with respect to all or a portion of the assets of the Trust,
Company shall have complete discretion with respect to the investment of such
assets at all times, and shall direct Trustee accordingly.  

Section 6.  Disposition of Income .   

During the term of this Trust, all income
received by the Trust, net of expenses and taxes, shall be accumulated and
reinvested in eligible property as defined in Section 1(h).  

Section 7.  Accounting by Trustee .   

Trustee shall keep accurate and detailed
records of all investments, receipts, disbursements, and other transactions
required to be made, including such specific records as shall be agreed upon in
writing between Company and Trustee. Within 60 days following the close of each
calendar year and within 60 days after the removal or resignation of Trustee,
Trustee shall deliver to Company a written account of its administration of the
Trust during such year or during the period from the close of the last
preceding year to the date of such removal or resignation, setting forth all
investments, receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by it,
including a description of all securities and investments purchased and sold
with the cost or net proceeds of such purchases or sales (accrued interest paid
or receivable being shown separately), and showing all cash, securities and
other property held in the Trust at the end of such year or as of the date of
such removal or resignation, as the case may be.  

Section 8.  Responsibility of Trustee .   

(a)          Trustee shall act with the
care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing
that a prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters
would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like
aims, provided, however, that Trustee shall incur no liability to any person
for any action taken pursuant to a direction, request or approval given by
Company which is contemplated by, and in conformity with, the terms of the Plans
or this Trust and is given in writing by Company, or for any failure to take
any action in the absence of such a direction, request or approval. The duties
of Trustee shall only be those specifically undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement or by means of a separate written agreement. In the event of a
dispute between Company and a party, Trustee may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction to resolve the dispute. 

(b)         The Employers and the Trust
hereby indemnify Trustee against, and agree to hold Trustee harmless from, all
liabilities and claims (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses in
defending against such liabilities and claims) against Trustee as a result  

10  

of any breach of fiduciary responsibility by
a fiduciary other than Trustee or an agent of Trustee (excluding any agent
which is Company or an agent of Company), unless Trustee or such agent of
Trustee participates knowingly in such breach.  

(c)          Trustee may consult with
legal counsel (who may also be counsel for Company generally) with respect to
any of its duties or obligations hereunder. 

(d)         Trustee may hire agents,
accountants, actuaries, investment advisors, financial consultants or other
professionals to assist it in performing any of its duties or obligations
hereunder. 

(e)          Trustee shall have, without
exclusion, all powers conferred on Trustees by applicable law, unless expressly
provided otherwise herein. 

(f)          Notwithstanding any powers
granted to Trustee pursuant to this Trust Agreement or pursuant to applicable
law, Trustee shall not have any power that could give this Trust the objective
of carrying on a business and dividing the gains therefrom, within the meaning
of section 301.7701-2 of the Procedure and Administrative Regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. 

Section 9.  Compensation and Expenses
of Trustee .   

The Employers shall pay all administrative
and Trustee s fees and expenses in such proportions as Company determines. Unless
and until so paid, such expenses and compensation shall be a charge on the
Trust and shall constitute a lien on the Trust in favor of Trustee. All
payments to, or reimbursements of, Trustee pursuant to this Trust Agreement may
be made without approval or direction of Company.  

Section 10.  Resignation and Removal
of Trustee .   

(a)          Trustee may resign at any
time by written notice to Company, which shall be effective 60 days after
receipt of such notice unless Company and Trustee agree otherwise. 

(b)         Trustee may be removed by Company
on 60 days notice or upon shorter notice accepted by Trustee. 

(c)          Notwithstanding subsection
(b), upon a Change of Control, Trustee may not be removed by Company for three
years. 

(d)         Upon resignation or removal
of Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee, all assets shall
subsequently be transferred to the successor Trustee. The transfer shall be
completed within 60 days after receipt of notice of resignation, removal or
transfer, unless Company extends the time limit. 

11  

(e)          If Trustee resigns or is
removed, a successor shall be appointed, in accordance with Section 11
hereof, by the effective date of resignation or removal under paragraph(s) (a) or
(b) of this section. If no such appointment has been made, Trustee may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor or
for instructions. All expenses of Trustee in connection with the proceeding
shall be allowed as administrative expenses of the Trust. 

Section 11.  Appointment of Successor .   

(a)          If Trustee resigns or is
removed in accordance with Section 10(a) or (b) hereof, Company
may appoint any national bank or trust company with capital in excess of
$50,000,000 as a successor to replace Trustee upon resignation or removal. The
appointment shall be effective when accepted in writing by the new Trustee, who
shall have all of the rights and powers of the former Trustee, including
ownership rights in the Trust assets. The former Trustee shall execute any
instrument necessary or reasonably required by Company or the successor Trustee
to evidence the transfer. 

(b)         The successor Trustee need
not examine the records and acts of any prior Trustee and may retain or dispose
of existing Trust assets, subject to Sections 7 and 8 hereof. The successor
Trustee shall not be responsible for and Company shall indemnify and defend the
successor Trustee from any claim or liability resulting from any action or
inaction of any prior Trustee or from any other past event, or any condition
existing at the time it becomes successor Trustee. 

Section 12.  Amendment or Termination .

for Funding Purposes   

Reference Yield   

  The yield on Moody s AA Corporate Bond Index (rounded to the nearest
..1%) as determined by Bloomberg on the day prior to the funding of the Trust. If
this yield information is no longer available from Bloomberg, an alternative
provider of the information will be chosen by the Chief Financial Officer.  

Deferred Compensation Plan   Senior
Management Group and Directors   

  The present value of all payments expected to be made to participants
and their spouses (or beneficiaries) based on the most recent calculation of
the value of participants  plan account balances (the  plan valuation ). In
accordance with the plan document, expected payments shall be based on (1) the
participants  marital status, (2) participants  and their spouses  life
expectancies at the time the participants have scheduled to begin receiving
payments, (3) the assumed retirement ages of participants and the time
following retirement that the participants have scheduled to begin receiving
payments, (4) the assumed crediting rate on participants  account
balances, which is equal to the crediting rate as of the most recent plan
valuation, and (5) the accumulated balances in participants  accounts as
of the latest plan valuation. The discount rate applied to these expected
payments shall be the interest rate used to calculate interest credited to
participants  plan account balances during the current plan year less 600 basis
points. Should the Trust be activated after the date of the latest plan
valuation (1) the total liability shall be increased by an amount equal to
the total liability as of the latest plan valuation times the discount rate
times the number of days since the latest plan valuation divided by 365 and (2) the
total liability shall be reduced by the present value of any payments made to
participants since the latest plan valuation.  

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan   

  The total value of participants  balances as of the close of business
on the day preceding the funding of the Trust.  

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan   Senior

would earn excluding any deferred income, but not taking into account IRS
limits on qualified income, and that (2) participants would earn excluding
any deferred income and taking into account IRS qualified income limitations. The
calculation of this liability is based on the annual actuarial factors
applicable for Supplemental Pension Plans I and IV respectively. Should the
Trust be activated after the date of the latest plan valuation, the amount of
the total liability shall be increased by (1) an amount equal to the total
liability as of the most recent plan valuation times the discount rate used in
that valuation divided by the number of days since the plan valuation was
conducted divided by 365 and (2) service credited since the latest annual
actuarial valuation.  

17  

Supplemental Pension Plans II and V   

  The difference in the present values of the pension annuities that (1) participants
would earn if the participants had not deferred any income and (2) participants
would earn excluding any deferred income, after taking into account any
benefits due under Supplemental Pension Plans I or IV. The calculation of this
liability is based on the annual actuarial factors applicable for Supplemental
Pension Plans II and V respectively. Should the Trust be activated after the date
of the latest plan valuation, the amount of the total liability shall be
increased by (1) an amount equal to the total liability as of the most
recent plan valuation times the discount rate used in that valuation divided by
the number of days since the plan valuation was conducted divided by 365 and (2) service
credited since the latest annual actuarial valuation.  

Supplemental Pension Plan III   

  The difference in the present values of the pension annuities that (1) participants
would earn by adding 5 years to their actual ages (but in no case will the
participant s age be deemed to be greater than age 65) and (2) the
benefits that these participants would earn without such an age adjustment,
after taking into account any benefits due under Supplemental Pension Plans I
and II. The calculation of this liability is based on the annual actuarial
factors applicable for Supplemental Pension Plan III. Should the Trust be
activated after the date of the latest plan valuation, the amount of the total
liability shall be increased by (1) an amount equal to the total liability
as of the most recent plan valuation times the discount rate used in that
valuation divided by the number of days since the plan valuation was conducted
divided by 365 and (2) service credited since the latest annual actuarial
valuation.  

Pilot Supplemental Pension Plan   

  The present value of all annuity payments either currently committed
to, or expected to be made to, participants between the ages of 55 and 65. The
discount rate applied to the expected annuity payments shall be the discount
rate used in the latest qualified pension plan annual actuarial valuation.  

Board of Director Consulting Fee   

  The present value of all consulting fees committed to members of the
Board of Directors as of the date of the Trust s funding. The discount rate
applied to the committed consulting fees shall be the Reference Yield.  

Executive Survivor Benefit Plan   

  The present value of all benefits expected to be paid to the surviving
spouses of participants. Expected payments are calculated based on (1) the
existing pension benefit formula, applied to a Joint and 100% Survivor annuity,
(2) expected growth in participants  compensation until retirement, which
is equal to the average assumed rate of compensation increase presented in the
Company s annual report pension footnote, (3) participants  marital status
and age of their spouses, and (4) the assumed retirement age of
participants. For purposes of calculating the duration of expected annuity
payments to surviving spouses, the differences in the expected lives of
participants and their spouses as of the date of the Trust s funding shall be
used. The discount rate applied to the expected annuity payments shall be the
Reference Yield.  

18

agreement payments committed to at the time o the Trust s funding. The discount
rate applied to the expected annuity payments shall be the Reference Yield.  

Excess Long-Term Disability Plan
