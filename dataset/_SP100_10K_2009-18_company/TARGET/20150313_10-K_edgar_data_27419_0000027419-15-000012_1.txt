PART I 
    Item 1.    Business 
    
  General 
    
  Target Corporation (Target, the Corporation or the Company) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1902. We offer our customers, referred to as "guests," everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated merchandise at discounted prices. Our ability to deliver a preferred shopping experience to our guests is supported by our strong supply chain and technology infrastructure, an ingrained devotion to innovation, and our disciplined approach to managing our business and investing in future growth.    
  Prior to the first quarter of 2013, we operated a U.S. Credit Card Segment that offered credit to qualified guests through our branded credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target Visa Credit Card. In the first quarter of 2013, we sold our U.S. consumer credit card portfolio, and TD Bank Group (TD) now underwrites, funds and owns Target Credit Card and Target Visa consumer receivables in the U.S.  We perform account servicing and primary marketing functions and earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the portfolio. Refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (the Financial Statements) for more information on the credit card receivables transaction. 
    
  Prior to January 15, 2015, we operated a Canadian segment. On January 15, 2015, we announced our exit from the Canadian market and Target Canada Co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of Target filed for protection (the Filing) in Canada under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto. Following the Filing, we no longer consolidate our Canadian retail operation.  Canadian financial results prior to the Filing are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) and Note 6 of the Financial Statements for more information. Effective January 15, 2015, we operate as a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations, which are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores, online or through mobile devices.  
    
  Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations. 
    
  Financial Highlights 
    
  For information on key financial highlights and segment financial information, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, MD A and Note 28 of the Financial Statements. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  A larger share of annual revenues and earnings traditionally occurs in the fourth quarter because it includes the peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December. 
    
  Merchandise 
    
  We sell a wide assortment of general merchandise and food through our store and digital channels. Our general merchandise stores offer an edited food assortment, including perishables, dry grocery, dairy and frozen items while our SuperTarget stores offer a full line of food items comparable to traditional supermarkets. Our urban format stores, CityTarget and TargetExpress, offer edited general merchandise and food assortments. Our digital channels include a wide assortment of general merchandise, including many items found in our stores, along with a complementary assortment such as additional sizes and colors sold only online. 
    2 

A significant portion of our sales is from national brand merchandise. Approximately one-third of   2014   sales related to our owned and exclusive brands, including but not limited to the following: 
    
                   Owned Brands

We also sell merchandise through periodic exclusive design and creative partnerships and generate revenue from in-store amenities such as Target Caf , Target Clinic, Target Pharmacy and Target Photo, and leased or licensed departments such as Target Optical, Pizza Hut, Portrait Studio and Starbucks. 
    
  Distribution 
    
  The vast majority of merchandise is distributed to our stores through our network of 38 distribution centers. Common carriers ship general merchandise to and from our distribution centers. Vendors or third party distributors ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores. 
    
  Employees 
    
  At   January 31, 2015  , we employed approximately 347,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees, referred to as "team members." During the sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December, our employment levels peaked at approximately 447,000 team members. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our team members. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, compensation level, date of hire and/or length of service. These company-paid benefits include a pension plan, 401(k) plan, medical and dental plans, a retiree medical plan, disability insurance, paid vacation, tuition reimbursement, various team member assistance programs, life insurance and merchandise discounts. We believe our team member relations are good. 
    
  Working Capital 
    
  Our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December, which we typically finance with cash flow provided by operations and short-term borrowings. Additional details are provided in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MD A. 
    
  Effective inventory management is key to our ongoing success, and we use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We achieve effective inventory management by being in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel items to minimize markdowns. 
    
    3 

Competition 
    
  We compete with traditional and off-price general merchandise retailers, apparel retailers, internet retailers, wholesale clubs, category specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce. Our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers and provide a compelling value proposition largely determine our competitive position within the retail industry. 
    
  Intellectual Property 
    
  Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, SuperTarget and our "Bullseye Design," have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection for our owned brands. 
    
  Geographic Information 
    
  Virtually all of our revenues from continuing operations are generated within the United States. Through 2014, our discontinued Canadian operations generated revenues in Canada. The vast majority of our long-lived assets are located within the United States. 
    
  Data Breach 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network (the Data Breach). For further information, see MD A and Note 17 of the Financial Statements. 
    
  Available Information 
    
  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge at www.Target.com/Investors as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
                       
  Our business is subject to many risks. Set forth below are the most significant risks that we face. For the convenience of the reader, the risks are listed in the categories where those risks primarily apply, but they may also apply to other categories. 
  Competitive and Reputational Risks 
  Our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Target which, if eroded, could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members. 
  We believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at Target, our team members choose Target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies: guests, team members, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of Target's reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. While reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation. Those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including consumer boycotts, lost sales, loss of new store and technology development opportunities, or team member retention and recruiting difficulties. For example, we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the Data Breach that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013, and while we now believe the incident will not have a long-term impact to our relationship with our guests, it is an example of an incident that affected our reputation and negatively impacted our sales for a period of time. In addition, the long-term reputational impact of discontinuing our Canadian operations on our guests, team members, vendors and other constituencies is unknown, and we may need to take actions that could increase our expenses and adversely affect the results of our operations. 
  If we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  The retail business is highly competitive. In the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests  shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, guest service, loyalty programs and marketing efforts. Our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers. Guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores, the functionality and reliability of our digital channels, our in-stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margins, and expenses. 
  We sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands. These brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales. If one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected. 
  The continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers. In particular, consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real-time product availability using digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price, the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of those and other factors. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel; providing and maintaining digital tools for our guests and team members that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use; working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise; and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our price-match policy. Failure to effectively execute in these efforts, actions by our competitors in response to these efforts, or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels, content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and, as a result, have an adverse effect on sales, gross margins, and expenses. 
    5 

If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable omnichannel experience for our guests, our sales, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected. 
  Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others). Our guests are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. We currently provide full and mobile versions of our website (Target.com), offer applications for mobile phones and tablets, and interact with our guests through social media. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. Our omnichannel retailing efforts include implementing new technology, software  and processes to be able to fulfill guest orders from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers, which is extremely complex and may not meet guest expectations for timely and accurate deliveries. If we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our omnichannel efforts, implement improvements to our guest facing technology in a timely manner, allow real-time and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase, quickly and efficiently fulfill our guests orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand, or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if Target.com and our other guest facing technology systems do not appeal to our guests, reliably function as designed, or maintain the privacy of guest data, or if we are unable consistently meet our brand promise to our guests, we may experience a loss of guest confidence, lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. 
  If we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margins and profitability could suffer. 
  A substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories, including apparel, home d cor, seasonal offerings, food and other merchandise. For example, we are investing more of our overall resources, including capital, marketing, and product development to focus on signature categories, including baby, kids, wellness, and style, and tailor our food assortment to support guest wellness goals and become more specialized with unique and differentiated items. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, emphasize the correct categories, and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales, spoilage, and increased inventory markdowns, which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales, gross margins, and profitability. 
  Technology Investments and Infrastructure Risks 
  If our capital investments in technology, new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns, our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
  Our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments, and the returns on these investments are less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores. We are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts, implement improvements to our guest facing technology, and evolve our inventory management system, information processes, and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guests. These technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. We must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace. In addition, our growth also depends, in part, on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Many of our expected new store sites are smaller and non-standard footprints located in fully developed markets, which are generally more time-consuming and expensive undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. 
    6 

A significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence. 
  We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process guest transactions, manage and maintain the privacy of guest data, communicate with our vendors and other third parties, service REDcard accounts, and summarize and analyze results, and on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet to use our computer systems. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions, and encounter lost guest confidence, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The Data Breach we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 negatively impacted our ability to handle customer inquiries, and we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the Data Breach. Similarly, we experienced a temporary network disruption not involving a data breach in June 2014 that prevented many of our point-of-sale registers from working in a limited geographic region. This disruption caused checkout delays and generated negative publicity, and we engaged in promotional activities to retain our customers during the delay. 
  We continually make significant technology investments that will help maintain and update our existing computer systems. Implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption. The potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency, and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence. 
  Data Security and Privacy Risks 
  If our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests, team members and vendors are unsuccessful, we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our sales and reputation could suffer. 
  An important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests, team members, and vendors. We have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, and temporary staff.  
  Until the Data Breach in the fourth quarter of 2013, all incidents we experienced were insignificant. The Data Breach we experienced was significant and went undetected for several weeks. Both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents other than the Data Breach; however, to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. If we or our vendors experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our guests could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to discontinue using our REDcards or pharmacy services, or stop shopping with us altogether. 
  We have recorded significant expenses related to the Data Breach. Our losses could exceed the amounts we have recorded by material amounts, and these matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  The Data Breach we experienced was significant, went undetected for several weeks, and involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network. We experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of the Data Breach, and we are currently facing litigation seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising out of the Data Breach. In addition, state and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC, are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. The governmental agencies investigating the Data Breach may seek to impose on us fines and/or other monetary relief and/or injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security costs, adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information, and put us at a competitive disadvantage with other retailers. Furthermore, three of the four major  
    7 

payment card networks, which between them represent a substantial majority of the payment cards potentially impacted by the Data Breach, have made written claims against us, either directly or through our acquiring banks, and we believe that it is probable that the fourth major payment card network will also make a claim against us. Collectively, the claims, investigations and other possible consequences of the Data Breach may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our results of operations. In the future we may be subject to additional investigations and claims of this sort. We have recorded Data Breach-related expenses that include our estimated probable losses for these matters, and it is reasonably possible that we may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued. 
  Supply Chain and Third Party Risks 
  Interruptions in our supply chain or fulfillment network, increased commodity, supply chain and fulfillment costs, or changes in our relationships with our vendors could adversely affect our gross margins, expenses and results of operations. 
  We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers, stores and our guests in a timely and efficient manner. As we continue to add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks, delivery delays or increased delivery costs that could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.  
  In addition, a large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, the outbreak of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and/or adversely affect our results of operations. For example, the labor disputes impacting the ports on the west coast of the U.S. that began in 2014 have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory, and if these disputes recur or worsen, it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply. Changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain, including vendor costs, labor, fuel, tariffs, currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives, could have an adverse effect on gross margins, expenses and results of operations. Changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations. We are unable to determine whether our decision to discontinue our Canadian operations will negatively impact our relationships with vendors that also supply our U.S. operations in a way that might cause less favorable terms, increased costs, result in less timely and efficient deliveries, or impact their ability to sell to Target. 
  A disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations. 
  We rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions, including portions of our technology development and systems, our digital platforms and distribution network operations, credit and debit card transaction processing, extensions of credit for our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, and aspects of our clinic and pharmacy operations. If we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business, or if we fail to properly manage those third parties or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, our reputation, sales, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services in-house. 
  Legal, Regulatory, Global and Other External Risks 
  Our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States. 
  Virtually all of our sales are in the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health of the U.S. economy. In addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Illinois, resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales, and reducing gross margins.  
    8 

These same considerations impact the success of our credit card program. Even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with TD. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in us receiving lower profit sharing payments.    
  Weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns, which alone or together with natural disasters, particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated, could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns, particularly in apparel and seasonal items, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short-term results of operations. In addition, our three largest states by total sales are California, Texas and Florida, areas where natural disasters are more prevalent. Natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores, distribution centers or key vendors, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers, stores, and directly to guests, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales. 
  We rely on a large, global and changing workforce of Target team members, contractors and temporary staffing. If we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations, our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  With approximately 347,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors, and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business changes. Many team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, collective bargaining efforts, health care and other benefit costs, changing demographics, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors and temporary staffing, our operations, guest service levels and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with increasing wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations. As of March 13, 2015, none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements. We are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts. If we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business. 
  We maintain a headquarters location in India where there has been greater political, financial, environmental and health instability than the United States. An extended disruption of our operations in India could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital channels and information technology development. 
  Failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. 
  If our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children s products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests  expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food or drug contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests. 
  Our failure to comply with federal, state, local, and international laws, or changes in these laws could increase our costs, reduce our margins, and lower our sales. 
  Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate. Significant workforce-related legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible workforce-related legislative changes include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment  
    9 

affecting Medicare reimbursements, privacy and information security, product safety, payment methods and related fees, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, or environmental protection, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. For example, we are currently facing government inquiries related to the Data Breach that may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties. In addition, any legislative or regulatory changes adopted in reaction to the recent retail-industry data breaches could increase or accelerate our compliance costs. Also, our pharmacy and clinic operations are governed by various regulations, and a significant change in, or our noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our compliance costs and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs, reducing our margins, and lowering our sales. 
  Financial Risks 
  Changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income. 
  A number of factors influence our effective income tax rate, including changes in tax law, tax treaties, interpretation of existing laws, and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination. Changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our net income. In addition, our operations outside of the United States may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate. 
  If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations could suffer. 
  We are dependent on a stable, liquid, and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. In particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong debt ratings. If rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same. In addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs, and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 
  If we are unable to make a fair and orderly exit of our Canadian operations, or if our existing reserves are not adequate to cover our ultimate liability, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  On January 15, 2015, we announced our decision to discontinue our Canadian operations and authorized a filing by our direct wholly owned subsidiary, Target Canada Co., and certain other subsidiaries under the Companies  Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada). During the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2015, we reported pretax losses from our discontinued Canadian operations, including pretax exit losses, a non-cash pretax impairment charge, and other operating losses. The losses from discontinued operations include probable losses relating to certain claims that may be asserted against us as a result of our guaranty of certain obligations of Target Canada Co. or other claims that may be made against us. Our reserves relating to these matters may not be adequate to cover our ultimate liability, and amounts beyond our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may suffer other losses for which we have not established reserves, although we believe that possibility is not probable. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently execute the wind-down of our Canadian operations, we may incur additional costs and cash outflows.

(a)  The 38 distribution centers have a total of 50,185 thousand square feet. 
    
  We own our corporate headquarters buildings located in and around Minneapolis, Minnesota, and we lease and own additional office space in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the United States. We also lease office space in 14 countries for various support functions. Our properties are in good condition, well maintained, and suitable to carry on our business.

Justice in Toronto (the Court). The Canada Subsidiaries comprise substantially all of our Canadian operations and our Canadian Segment. The Canada Subsidiaries have commenced an orderly liquidation process and expect that stores in Canada will remain open during the liquidation. To assist with the exit plan, the Court approved the appointment of a monitor and certain other financial advisors. See Item 7, MD A and Note 6 of the Financial Statements for more information.

PART II 
    
    Item 5.    Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TGT." We are authorized to issue up to 6,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0833, and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01. At   March 6, 2015  , there were 15,733 shareholders of record. Dividends declared per share and the high and low closing common stock price for each fiscal quarter during   2014   and   2013   are disclosed in Note 30 of the Financial Statements. 
  In January 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $5 billion of our common stock, with no stated expiration for the share repurchase program. We have repurchased   49.9 million   shares of our common stock under this program for a total cash investment of   $3.1 billion   (  $62.85   average price per share). 
  The table below presents our purchases of Target common stock during the three months ended   January 31, 2015  , as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act. 

(a)   
    The table above includes shares reacquired upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. At   January 31, 2015  , we held asset positions in prepaid forward contracts for 0.5 million shares of our common stock, for a total cash investment of $21.5 million, or an average per share price of $41.13. 0.2 million shares were reacquired under such contracts during the fourth quarter.  Refer to Notes 23 and 25 of the Financial Statements for further details of these contracts. 
               (b)   
    The number of shares above includes shares of common stock reacquired from team members who tendered owned shares to i) satisfy the tax withholding on equity awards as part of our long-term incentive plans or ii) satisfy the exercise price on stock option exercises. For the three months ended   January 31, 2015  , 14,423 shares were reacquired at an weighted average per share price of $68.73 pursuant to our long-term incentive plan. 
       13 

The graph above compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the last five fiscal years with (i) the cumulative total return on the S P 500 Index, (ii) the peer group used in previous filings consisting of 14 online, general merchandise, department store, food and specialty retailers, which are large and meaningful competitors  (Amazon.com, Best Buy, Costco, CVS Caremark, Home Depot, J. C. Penney, Kohl's, Kroger, Lowe's, Macy's, Safeway, Sears, Walgreens and Walmart) (Previous Peer Group), and (iii) a new peer group consisting of the companies in the Previous Peer Group excluding J.C. Penney with the addition of Dollar General, The Gap, Publix, Rite Aid, Staples, and TJX (Current Peer Group). The change in peer groups was made to be consistent with the retail peer group used for our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed on or about April 27, 2015. 
  The peer group is weighted by the market capitalization of each component company. The graph assumes the investment of $100 in Target common stock, the S P 500 Index and the Peer Group on January 30, 2010, and reinvestment of all dividends.

Item 6.    Selected Financial Data 

Note:  This information should be read in conjunction with MD A and the Financial Statements. 
             (b)   
    For 2014 and 2013, total revenues include sales generated by our retail operations. For 2012 and prior, total revenues include sales generated by our retail operations and credit card revenues. 
       
    Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
    Executive Summary 
    
  Fiscal 2014 included the following notable items: 
             
    GAAP earnings per share were   $(2.56)  , including dilution of   $(6.38)   related to discontinued operations. 
                
    Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were   $4.27  . 
                
    Comparable sales grew   1.3   percent. Digital channel sales growth of more than 30 percent contributed 0.7 percentage points to 2014 comparable sales growth. 
        
  Sales from continuing operations were   $72,618 million   for   2014  , an increase of   $1,339 million   or   1.9   percent from the prior year. Earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in   2014   decreased by   $636 million   or   12.3   percent from   2013   to   $4,535 million  . Cash flow provided by continuing operations was   $5,131 million  ,   $7,519 million  , and   $5,568 million   for   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. In connection with the sale of our U.S. credit card receivables, we received cash of $5.7 billion during 2013. Of this amount, $2.7 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and $3.0 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations. 
    15 

Note:  Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations and the impact of our discontinued Canadian operations. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 21. 
     
  Canada Exit 
    
  On January 14, 2015, following a comprehensive assessment of Canadian operations, our Board of Directors approved a plan to discontinue operating stores in Canada.  As a result of this decision, on January 15, 2015, Target Canada Co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of Target (collectively Canada Subsidiaries), filed for protection (the Filing) under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto (the Court). The Canada Subsidiaries comprise substantially all of our Canadian operations and our Canadian Segment. The Canada Subsidiaries have commenced an orderly liquidation process and stores in Canada will remain open during the liquidation. To assist with the exit plan, the Court approved the appointment of a monitor and certain other financial advisors. 
    
  As a result of the Filing, we no longer have a controlling interest in the Canada Subsidiaries. For this reason, we deconsolidated the Canada Subsidiaries effective January 15, 2015, resulting in a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges, collectively totaling   $5.1 billion  . The pretax loss on deconsolidation includes the derecognition of the carrying amounts of the Canada Subsidiaries' assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss and the recording of our remaining interests at fair value. 
    
  Subsequent to deconsolidation, we will use the cost method to account for our equity investment in the Canada Subsidiaries, which has been reflected as zero in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at January 31, 2015 based on the estimated fair value of the Canada Subsidiaries' net assets. Loans to and accounts receivable from the Canada Subsidiaries are recorded at an estimated fair value of   $326 million  . Our ultimate cash recovery on these claims is subject to the final liquidation value of the Canada Subsidiaries and could vary materially from our estimates. 
    
  Our Canada exit represents a strategic shift in our business.  For this reason, our Canadian Segment results for all periods prior to the January 15, 2015 deconsolidation and costs to exit are classified as discontinued operations. 
    
  We have recognized a tax benefit of $1.6 billion in discontinued operations, which primarily relates to the loss on our investment in Canada and includes other tax benefits resulting from certain asset write-offs and liabilities paid or accrued to facilitate the liquidation. We have realized the majority of these tax benefits in the first quarter of 2015 and expect to realize substantially all of the remainder in 2015.   
    
  The recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us, primarily under guarantees in certain leases. Our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated. Given the early stage of our exit and the Filing, our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. We are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the year-end accrual because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We believe that it is reasonably possible that future changes to our estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods. Any such losses would be recorded in discontinued operations. 
    
  We expect to incur severance, legal and professional services expenses associated with our Canadian exit. We will recognize these expenses within discontinued operations as services are received and liabilities are incurred. We currently cannot predict the timing of such expenses and associated cash disbursements; however, we do not expect these amounts to be material to our results in future periods. 
    
    16 

See Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further information regarding our Canada exit. 
    
  Data Breach 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network (the Data Breach). In 2014, we recorded $191 million of pretax Data Breach-related expenses and $46 million of expected insurance proceeds, for net expenses of $145 million. These expenses were included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG A), but were not part of segment SG A. Along with legal and other professional services, these expenses include an accrual for estimated probable losses for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by the payment card networks. Our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable for the losses we have accrued were these claims to be litigated.  
    
  As of January 31, 2015 we have incurred $252 million of cumulative Data Breach-related expenses, partially offset by $90 million of expected insurance recoveries, for net cumulative expenses of $162 million. 
    
  For more information about the Data Breach, see Note 17 of the Financial Statements. 
    
    Analysis of Results of Operations 
    
  Segment Results 

Note:  Effective January 15, 2015, we operate as a single segment which includes all of our continuing operations, excluding net interest expense, data breach related costs and certain other expenses which are discretely managed. Our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores, online or through mobile devices. See Note 28 of our Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes. 
             (b)   
    SG A includes credit card revenues and expenses for all periods presented prior to the March 2013 sale of our U.S. consumer credit card portfolio to TD.  For 2014 and 2013, SG A also includes $682 million and $653 million, respectively, of profit-sharing income from the arrangement with TD. 

Note:  Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. 
     
    17 

Sales 
    
  Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. The increase in 2014 sales reflects a   1.3   percent increase in comparable sales and the contribution from new stores.     The     sales decline in   2013   reflected the impact of an additional week in 2012 and a decline in comparable sales, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented. 
  Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales from stores open at least 13 months. Digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites, including those of acquired entities from the date of acquisition, and may be fulfilled through our distribution centers or our stores. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  

Note:  Amounts may not foot due to rounding  . 

(a)    
    Includes pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning and paper products. 
               (b)    
    Includes electronics (including video game hardware and software), music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods and toys. 
               (c)    
    Includes apparel for women, men, boys, girls, toddlers, infants and newborns, as well as intimate apparel, jewelry, accessories and shoes. 
               (d)    
    Includes dry grocery, dairy, frozen food, beverages, candy, snacks, deli, bakery, meat, produce and pet supplies. 
               (e)    
    Includes furniture, lighting, kitchenware, small appliances, home d cor, bed and bath, home improvement, automotive and seasonal merchandise such as patio furniture and holiday d cor. 
       
  Further analysis of sales metrics is infeasible due to the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores. 
  TD offers credit to qualified guests through Target-branded credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target Visa Credit Card (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards       . Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping when they use a REDcard at Target.  We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target.

Note:  The sum of Target Credit Cards and Target Debit Card penetration may not equal Total REDcard Penetration due to rounding. 
    
  Gross Margin Rate 

Our gross margin rate was   29.4   percent in   2014  ,   29.8   percent in   2013  , and   29.7   percent in   2012  . The 2014 decrease is primarily due to promotional activity.  
    
  The 2013 increase was primarily the result of a change in vendor contracts regarding payments received in support of marketing programs resulting in more vendor consideration being recognized as a reduction of our cost of sales rather than a reduction of SG A. Increases to the rate were offset by our integrated growth strategies of our 5 percent REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate 

Our SG A expense rate was   19.9   percent in 2014,   20.0   percent in 2013, and   19.1   percent in 2012. The decrease in 2014 primarily related to company-wide expense optimization efforts, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives, none of which were individually significant.  
    
  The increase in 2013 resulted from a smaller contribution from our credit card portfolio, investments in technology and supply chain in support of multichannel initiatives, changes in merchandise vendor contracts described above, and other increases. Increases were partially offset by the benefit from our company-wide expense optimization efforts and favorable incentive compensation and store hourly payroll.

  Other Performance Factors 
    
  Other Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  In addition to segment selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded certain other expenses during 2014 and 2013. For 2014, these expenses included $145 million of net Data Breach-related costs, $16 million of impairments related to undeveloped U.S. land and $13 million of costs related to previously announced plans to convert existing co-branded REDcards to MasterCard co-branded chip-and-PIN cards in 2015 to support the accelerated transition to chip-and-PIN-enabled REDcards. For 2013, these expenses included a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, $19 million in impairment charges related to undeveloped U.S. land, and $17 million of net Data Breach-related costs. Additional information about these items is provided within the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures on page 21. 
    
  Net Interest Expense 
    
  Net interest expense from continuing operations was   $882 million  ,   $1,049 million  , and   $684 million   for   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. Net interest expense for 2014 and 2013 included a loss on early retirement of debt of $285 million and $445 million, respectively. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to   33.0   percent in   2014  , from   34.6   percent in   2013  , driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $35 million and $16 million in   2014   and   2013  , respectively.  A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to   34.6   percent in   2013  , from   34.4   percent in   2012  , driven by a lower year-over-year benefit from the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $16 million and $58 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
    
    20 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures 
    
  To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes the impact of the 2013 sale of our U.S. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, losses on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach and other matters presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our  continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS from continuing operations differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Prior year amounts have been revised to present Adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis. 

Note: The sum of the non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding.

    2014 includes impairments of $16 million related to undeveloped land in the U.S. and $13 million of expense related to converting co-branded card program to MasterCard. 2013 includes a   $23 million   workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a   $22 million   charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, and   $19 million   in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land. 
       
    Analysis of Financial Condition 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was   $2,210 million  , compared with   $670 million   in   2013  . Short-term investments of $1,520 million and $3 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of   2014   and   2013  , respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Our   2014   operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was   $5,131 million   in 2014 compared with   $7,519 million   in 2013. Net cash flow provided by continuing operations for 2013 includes $5.7 billion of cash received in connection with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit card receivables, of which $2.7 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and $3.0 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations. In June 2014, we issued $1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in June 2019 and $1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in July 2024. Combined with our prior year-end cash position, these cash flows allowed us to repurchase $725 million of debt at a market value of $1 billion, pay current debt maturities, invest in the business and pay dividends. 
    
  Year-end inventory levels increased from   $8,278 million   in   2013   to   $8,790 million   in   2014  .  Accounts payable increased     by   $424 million  , or   5.8   percent over the same period. 
    21 

Share Repurchases 
    
  In January 2012, we began repurchasing shares under a $5 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors. Since the second quarter of 2013, we have not repurchased any shares on the open market. However, as described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements, we reacquired   0.8 million   shares during 2014 upon the noncash settlement of prepaid forward contracts related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans. During the first half of   2013  , we repurchased   21.9 million   shares of our common stock for a total investment of   $1,474 million   (  $67.41   per share). 
    
  Dividends 
    
  We paid dividends totaling   $1,205 million   in   2014   and   $1,006 million   in   2013  , an increase of   19.8   percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,271 million ($1.99 per share) in   2014  , a per share increase of 20.6 percent over   2013  . We declared dividends totaling $1,051 million ($1.65 per share) in   2013  , a per share increase of 19.6 percent over   2012  . We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. 
    
  Short-term and Long-term Financing 
    
  Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings.  As of   January 31, 2015  , our credit ratings were as follows: 
    
                     Credit Ratings 
    Moody's 
    Standard and Poor's 
    Fitch 
      Long-term debt 
    A2 
    A 
    A- 
      Commercial paper 
    P-1 
    A-1 
    F2 

If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. Standard and Poor's lowered our long-term debt rating from A+ to A during 2014, but maintained our A-1 commercial paper rating. 
  As a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges, which represents the ratio of pretax earnings from continuing operations before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   6.02  x in   2014  , 6.48x in   2013   and 7.10x in 2012.  See Exhibit (12) for a description of how the gain on sale of our U.S. credit card receivable portfolio and loss on early retirement of debt affected the 2014, 2013 and 2012 calculations. 
  In   2014   and 2013, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper.   

We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that expires in October 2018. No balances were outstanding at any time during   2014   or   2013   under this facility. 
    
  Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at   January 31, 2015  , no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring  
    22 

acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. 
    
  We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from Canada, fund obligations incurred as a result of the Data Breach and any related future technology enhancements, pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We believe that our exit from Canada will increase our after-tax cash flows beginning in 2015. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing. 
    
  Capital Expenditures 

Capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by technology investments to support of our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements. Capital expenditures decreased in 2013 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores. We expect approximately $2.1 billion of capital expenditures in 2015, reflecting our focus on becoming a leading omnichannel retailer through investments in technology and supply chain, elevating signature categories and opening new stores, including urban formats.  
    
  Capital expenditures related to our discontinued Canadian operations were $228 million, $1,567 million and $932 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies 

(a)       
    Represents principal payments only, and excludes any fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt under derivative and hedge accounting rules. See Note 18 of the Financial Statements for further information. 
               (b)       
    These payments also include $59 million and $67 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2015 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. See Note 20 of the Financial Statements for further information. 
               (c)       
    Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. 
               (d)   
    Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. 
               (e)   
    Estimated tax contingencies of $195 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 21 of the Financial Statements for further information. 
               (f)   
    Estimated loss contingencies, including those related to the Canada Exit and the Data Breach, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 6 and Note 17 of the Financial Statements for further information.  
               (g)   
    Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. 
               (h)   
    Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. 
               (i)   
    We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of   January 31, 2015  . Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. 
       
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements:      Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. 
    
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual  
    24 

results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, except as discussed below regarding Canada Exit and Data Breach-related costs, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment: 
  Inventory and cost of sales:      We use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was   $8,790 million   and   $8,278 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively, and is further described in Note 10 of the Financial Statements. 
  Vendor income receivable:      Cost of sales and SG A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors (Vendor Income). Vendor Income is earned for a variety of programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, advertising allowances and compliance programs. We establish a receivable for Vendor Income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of year-end Vendor Income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our Vendor Income receivable have not been material. Vendor Income receivable was   $493 million   and   $536 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Financial Statements. 
  Long-lived assets:      Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate.  We recorded impairments of   $124 million  ,   $77 million  , and   $37 million   in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, which are described further in Note 12. As of   January 31, 2015  , a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of $5 million in 2014. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets. 
  Investments in and receivables from Canada Subsidiaries:      We determined the fair value and recoverability of our Canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the Canada Subsidiaries to estimated liabilities at the time of the Filing. We estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell, the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates, and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments, as appropriate. We also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the CCAA filing.  
  Outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities and other potential claims. Potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the Canada Subsidiaries under certain contracts. Based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets.  
  To assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the Canada Subsidiaries, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the Canada Subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims. 
  Our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. Our ultimate recovery is subject to the  
    25 

final liquidation value of the Canada Subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates. See Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further information. 
  Insurance/self-insurance:      We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $566 million and $576 million at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $28 million in   2014  . Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures.  We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Since the Data Breach, we have recognized $90 million of expected insurance recoveries related to the Data Breach.  As of January 31, 2015, we have a $60 million insurance-recovery receivable relating to the Data Breach because we believe recovery is probable. However, it is possible that the insurance carriers could dispute our claims and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable. 
  Income taxes:      We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $195 million and $241 million at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 21 of the Financial Statements. 
  Pension and postretirement health care accounting:      We maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate and compensation growth rates. The assumptions used to determine the period-end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes. 
  Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of   7.5   percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was   12.1 percent  ,   8.3 percent  ,   7.0 percent   and   9.7 percent   for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $31 million. 
  The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $29 million. 
  Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. 
  Pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 26 of the Financial Statements. 
  Legal and other contingencies:      We are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range.  
    26 

If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.   
  We believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. With the exception of Canada Exit and Data Breach-related loss exposures, we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. Refer to Notes 6 and 17 of the Financial Statements for further information on the Canada Exit and Data Breach-related contingencies, respectively. 
    
    New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. 
    
    Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, including those related to the Data Breach and discontinuing our Canadian operations, expected insurance recoveries, expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax benefits related to discontinuing our Canadian operations, the process, timing and effects of discontinuing our Canadian operations, the resolution of tax matters, and changes in our assumptions and expectations. 
  All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 
    
    Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  At   January 31, 2015  , our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate. Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments. At   January 31, 2015  , our floating rate short-term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately $270 million.  Based on our balance sheet position at January 31, 2015, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate short-term investments, net of our debt obligations, would decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $0.3 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short-term investments over time, but that may vary in different interest rate environments.  See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 18 and 19 of the Notes to Financial Statements. 
  We record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at   January 31, 2015  , the annualized  
    27 

effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by $9 million. 
  In addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $29 million. To protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged 50 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status. 
  As more fully described in Note 13 and Note 25 of the Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant. 
  There have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.

Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
    
  Report of Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
  Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity and presentation of the information in the Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include necessary judgments and estimates by management. 
  To fulfill our responsibility, we maintain comprehensive systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of internal control provide this reasonable assurance. 
  The Board of Directors exercised its oversight role with respect to the Corporation's systems of internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent directors. The Committee oversees the Corporation's systems of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and audits to assess whether their quality, integrity and objectivity are sufficient to protect shareholders' investments. 
  In addition, our consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, whose report also appears on this page.

  The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
  Target Corporation 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2015  . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2015  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated   March 13, 2015  , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , based on the framework in   Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we conclude that the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
  Our internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who has also audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report which appears on this page.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
  Target Corporation 
    
  We have audited Target Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). The Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2015  , based on the COSO criteria. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries as of   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2015  , and our report dated   March 13, 2015  , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
    1. Summary of Accounting Policies 
    
  Organization      We are a general merchandise retailer selling products to our guests through our stores and digital channels in the U.S. 
    
  As more fully described in Note 6, in January 2015, we announced our exit from the Canadian market and filed for protection (the Filing) under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto (the Court). Our prefiling financial results in Canada and subsequent expenses directly attributable to the Canada exit are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. Effective January 15, 2015, Target Corporation (Target, the Corporation, or the Company) operates as a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations, which are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores, online or through mobile devices.  
    
  Consolidation      The consolidated financial statements include the balances of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. As of January 15, 2015, we deconsolidated substantially all of our Canadian operations following the Filing. See Note 6 for more information.  
    
  Use of estimates      The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. 
    
  Fiscal year      Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal   2014   ended   January 31, 2015   and consisted of   52   weeks. Fiscal   2013   ended   February 1, 2014  , and consisted of   52   weeks. Fiscal   2012   ended   February 2, 2013  , and consisted of   53   weeks. Fiscal 2015 will end January 30, 2016, and will consist of   52   weeks. 
    
  Accounting policies      Our accounting policies are disclosed in the applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
    
    2. Revenues 
    
  Our retail stores generally record revenue at the point of sale. Digital channel sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest. Total revenues do not include sales tax because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return merchandise within   90 days   of purchase. Revenues are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns as a percentage of sales. Commissions earned on sales generated by leased departments are included within sales and were   $32 million  ,   $29 million   and   $25 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  Revenue from gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption. Our gift cards do not expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was not material in any period presented. 
    
  Guests receive a   5   percent discount on virtually all purchases and receive free shipping at Target.com when they use their REDcard. The discounts associated with loyalty programs are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were   $943 million  ,   $833 million   and   $583 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 

36 

3. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  The following table illustrates the primary items classified in each major expense category: 
    
                 Cost of Sales 
    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
      Total cost of products sold including 
      Freight expenses associated with moving 
      merchandise from our vendors to our 
      distribution centers and our retail stores, and 
      among our distribution and retail facilities 
      Vendor income that is not reimbursement of 
      specific, incremental and identifiable costs 
  Inventory shrink 
  Markdowns 
  Outbound shipping and handling expenses 
      associated with sales to our guests 
  Payment term cash discounts 
  Distribution center costs, including compensation 
      and benefits costs 
  Import costs 
    Compensation and benefit costs including 
      Stores 
      Headquarters 
  Occupancy and operating costs of retail and 
      headquarters facilities 
  Advertising, offset by vendor income that is a 
      reimbursement of specific, incremental and 
      identifiable costs 
  Pre-opening costs of stores and other facilities 
  U.S. credit cards servicing expenses and profit  
      sharing 
  Litigation and defense costs and related insurance  
      recovery 
  Other administrative costs 
   
 Note: The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. 
    
    4. Consideration Received from Vendors 
    
  We receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances and for our compliance programs, referred to as "vendor income." Vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or SG A expenses based on the provisions of the arrangement. Under our compliance programs, vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not meet our requirements (violations), such as late or incomplete shipments. These allowances are recorded when violations occur. Substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales. 
  We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating the amount earned when we have completed our performance. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate. The majority of year-end receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter. We have not historically had significant write-offs for these receivables. 
    
    5. Advertising Costs 
    
  Advertising costs, which primarily consist of newspaper circulars, internet advertisements and media broadcast, are expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement. 

(a)   
    A 2013 change to certain merchandise vendor contracts resulted in more vendor funding being recognized as a reduction of our cost of sales rather than offsetting advertising expenses. 
       
    6. Canada Exit 
    
  Background 
    
  On January 14, 2015, following a comprehensive assessment of Canadian operations, our Board of Directors approved a plan to discontinue operating stores in Canada. As a result of this decision, on January 15, 2015, Target Canada Co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of Target (collectively Canada Subsidiaries), filed for protection under the CCAA with the Court. The Canada Subsidiaries comprise substantially all of our Canadian operations and our Canadian Segment. The Canada Subsidiaries have commenced an orderly liquidation process and stores will remain  
    37 

open during the liquidation. To assist with the exit plan, the Court approved the appointment of a monitor and certain other financial advisors. 
    
  As a result of the Filing, we no longer have a controlling interest in the Canada Subsidiaries. For this reason, we deconsolidated the Canada Subsidiaries effective January 15, 2015, which resulted in a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges, collectively totaling   $5.1 billion  . The pretax loss on deconsolidation includes the derecognition of the carrying amounts of the Canada Subsidiaries' assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss and the recording of our remaining interests at fair value. 
    
  Subsequent to deconsolidation, we will use the cost method to account for our equity investment in the Canada Subsidiaries, which has been reflected as zero in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at January 31, 2015 based on the estimated fair value of the Canada Subsidiaries' net assets. Loans to and accounts receivable from the Canada Subsidiaries are recorded at an estimated fair value of   $326 million  . 
    
  Loss on Discontinued Operations 
    
  Our Canadian exit represents a strategic shift in our business.  For this reason, our Canadian Segment results for all periods prior to the January 15, 2015 deconsolidation and costs to exit are classified as discontinued operations. 

The fourth quarter Canadian pretax exit costs totaled   $5,105 million   and included the following: 

Investments in Canada Subsidiaries 
    
  Target continues to indirectly own   100%   of the common stock of the Canada Subsidiaries, but has deconsolidated those entities because Target no longer has a controlling interest. At the date of deconsolidation, we adjusted our investment in the Canada Subsidiaries to fair value with a corresponding charge to income. Because the estimated amount of the Canada Subsidiaries' liabilities exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets available for distribution to its creditors, the fair value of Target s equity investment approximates   zero  . 
  Target Corporation Amounts Receivable from Canada Subsidiaries 
    
  Prior to deconsolidation, Target Corporation made loans to the Canada Subsidiaries for the purpose of funding its operations and had accounts receivable generated in the ordinary course of business. The loans, corresponding interest and the accounts receivable were considered intercompany transactions and eliminated in the consolidated Target Corporation financial statements. As of the deconsolidation date, the loans, associated interest and accounts  
    38 

receivable are now considered related party transactions and have been recognized in Target Corporation's consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair value of   $326 million  . 
    
  Target Corporation Contingencies 
    
  The recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us, primarily under guarantees of certain leases. The beneficiaries of those guarantees may seek damages or other related relief as a result of our exit from Canada. Our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated. Given the early stage of our exit and the Filing, our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. We are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the year-end accrual because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. We believe that it is reasonably possible that future changes to our estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods. Any such losses would be reported in discontinued operations. 
    
  Employee Trust  
    
  In connection with the Filing, the Court approved our request to establish an employee trust (the Trust) to fund certain payments to our Canadian employees outside of the estate. We have recorded expense based on an estimate of our total contribution to the Trust of   $73 million  , which was fully funded in 2014. The Trust is a variable interest entity in which we have a variable interest. However, the Trust is not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary. 
    
  Recovery Estimates and Valuation Techniques 
    
  We determined the fair value and recoverability of our Canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the Canada Subsidiaries to estimated liabilities at the time of the Filing. The major asset classes were valued as follows: 
    
                     Asset 
      
    Valuation Technique    (a)  
    Pricing Category 
      Inventory 
      
    Estimated selling price less costs to sell 
    Level 3 
      Owned property 
      
    Income approach based on estimated market rents and cap rates 
    Level 3 
      Leased property, including leasehold improvements 
      
    Discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments 
    Level 3 

(a)   
    An estimated liquidation discount was applied to reflect the CCAA filing. 
       
  Outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities and other potential claims. Potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the Canada Subsidiaries under certain contracts. Claimants may seek damages or other related relief as a result of the Canada Subsidiaries' exit from Canada. Based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets. 
    
  To assess the fair value and recoverability of the amounts receivable from the Canada Subsidiaries, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the Canada Subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims.  
    
  Our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. Our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the Canada Subsidiaries. Further, the final liquidation value and ultimate recovery of the creditors of the Canada Subsidiaries, including Target Corporation, may impact our estimates of contingent liability exposure described above.  
    
    39 

Recorded Assets and Liabilities 

(a)    
    Represents the fair value of loans and accounts receivable from Canada Subsidiaries. 
       
  DIP Financing 
    
  In conjunction with the Filing, the Court approved Target's agreement to provide a debtor-in-possession credit facility (the DIP facility) to the Canada Subsidiaries, which provides for borrowings under the facility up to   $175 million  .  The DIP facility will be used to finance the Canada Subsidiaries' operations during the CCAA process. Amounts borrowed by the Canada Subsidiaries under the DIP facility will have a priority claim over certain other secured and unsecured claims except for other Court ordered charges and permitted priority liens under the law. Amounts drawn under the DIP and repaid cannot be reborrowed. As of January 31, 2015, there was   $19 million   drawn and outstanding under the DIP facility, which was fully repaid in 2015. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We have recognized a tax benefit of   $1,627 million   in discontinued operations, which primarily relates to a loss on our investment in Canada and includes other tax benefits resulting from certain asset write-offs and liabilities paid or accrued to facilitate the liquidation. The tax benefit in discontinued operations reflects certain tax attribute carryforwards including a gross federal operating loss of   $694 million   and gross state operating losses of   $423 million  . We have realized the majority of these tax benefits in the first quarter of 2015, and expect to realize substantially all of the remainder in 2015.   
    
  Canadian deferred tax assets relating to both historical and current year net operating losses were included in our equity investment in the Canada Subsidiaries that has been reduced to   zero  . 
    
  As part of our exit from Canada we also incurred a   $284 million   gross capital loss on a transaction within our consolidated group. We currently do not have nor anticipate sufficient capital gains to absorb this capital loss.  Therefore, we have established a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset.   
    
    7. Credit Card Receivables Transaction 
    
  In March 2013, we sold our entire U.S. consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD) and recognized a gain of    $391 million  .  This transaction was accounted for as a sale, and the receivables are no longer reported in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Consideration received included cash of   $5.7 billion  , equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing, and a   $225 million   beneficial interest asset. Concurrent with the sale of the portfolio, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of   $1.5 billion  , resulting in net cash proceeds of   $4.2 billion  .  
  TD now underwrites, funds and owns Target Credit Card and Target Visa receivables. TD controls risk management policies and oversees regulatory compliance, and we perform account servicing and primary marketing functions. We earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the Target Credit Card and Target Visa portfolios. Income from the TD profit-sharing arrangement and our related account servicing expenses are classified within segment SG A expenses. 
    40 

(a)   
    Segment SG A also reflected credit card revenues earned in 2013 prior to the close of the transaction. 
               (b)   
    On a consolidated basis, profit-sharing income is offset by reductions of the beneficial interest asset. 
       
  The   $225 million   beneficial interest asset recognized at the close of the transaction effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit-sharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold. Profit-sharing payments reduced the beneficial interest asset by   $73 million   and   $96 million   during 2014 and 2013, respectively. Revaluation adjustments increased the asset by   $20 million   during 2014 and reduced the asset by   $2 million   during 2013. As of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, a beneficial interest asset of   $74 million   and   $127 million  , respectively, remains and is recorded within other current assets and other noncurrent assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on historical payment patterns, we estimate that the remaining beneficial interest asset will be reduced over the next   two   years. 
  Prior to the sale, credit card revenues were recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement.  When accounts were written off, uncollected finance charges and late fees were recorded as a reduction of credit card revenues. Target retail sales charged on our credit cards totaled   $5,807 million   in 2012. 
    
    8. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). 

(a)   
    See Note 19 for additional information on interest rate swaps. 
               (b)   
    Note 7 includes a rollforward of the Level 3 beneficial interest asset.  
               (c)   
    Company-owned life insurance investments consist of equity index funds and fixed income assets. Amounts are presented net of nonrecourse loans that are secured by some of these policies. These loan amounts totaled   $773 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   $790 million   at   February 1, 2014  . 
       
    41 

Valuation Technique 
      Short-term investments - Carrying value approximates fair value because maturities are less than three months. 
      Prepaid forward contracts - Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the market price of Target common stock. 
      Interest rate swaps - Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model (e.g., interest rates and credit spreads).  
      Company-owned life insurance investments - Includes investments in separate accounts that are valued based on market rates credited by the insurer. 
      Beneficial interest asset - Valued using a cash-flow based economic-profit model, which includes inputs of the forecasted performance of the receivables portfolio and a market-based discount rate.  Internal data is used to forecast expected payment patterns and write-offs, revenue, and operating expenses (credit EBIT yield) related to the credit card portfolio.  Changes in macroeconomic conditions in the United States could affect the estimated fair value.  A one percentage point change in the forecasted EBIT yield would impact our fair value estimate by approximately $11 million.  A one percentage point change in the forecasted discount rate would impact our fair value estimate by approximately $2 million.  As described in Note 7, this beneficial interest asset effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit-sharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold.  As a result, a portion of the profit-sharing payments we receive from TD will reduce the beneficial interest asset.  As the asset is reduced over time, changes in the forecasted credit EBIT yield and the forecasted discount rate will have a smaller impact on the estimated fair value. 

(a)   
    The carrying amounts of certain other current assets, accounts payable, and certain accrued and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
               (b)   
    The fair value of debt is generally measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments and would be classified as Level 2. These amounts exclude unamortized swap valuation adjustments and capital lease obligations. 
       
  Refer to Note 6 for information about fair value measurements related to our discontinued Canadian operations. 
    
    9. Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase. These investments were   $1,520 million   and   $3 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. Cash equivalents also include amounts due from third-party financial institutions for credit and debit card transactions. These receivables typically settle in less than   five days   and were   $379 million   and   $346 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively.  
    
    10. Inventory 
    
  The majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method (RIM) using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  Inventory is stated at the lower of LIFO cost or market. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed in the period incurred. Inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. The LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally measured retail price indices. 
  Under RIM, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the inventory retail value. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. 
  Certain other inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market using the cost method.  The valuation allowance for inventory valued under a cost method was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of fiscal 2014 or 2013. 
    42 

We routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Activity under this program is included in sales and cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position because of the virtually simultaneous purchase and sale of this inventory. Sales made under these arrangements totaled   $2,040 million  ,   $1,833 million   and   $1,800 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
    11. Other Current Assets 

12. Property and Equipment 
    
  Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or lease terms if shorter. We amortize leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term over the shorter of the assets' useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired. Depreciation and capital lease amortization expense for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was   $2,108 million  ,   $1,975 million   and   $2,027 million  , respectively. For income tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are generally used. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Facility pre-opening costs, including supplies and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

    2-7 

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a decision to relocate or close a store or make significant software changes, indicate that the asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. For asset groups classified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the fair value less cost to sell.  We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, valuations from third party brokers or other valuation techniques.  

(a)   
    Substantially all of the impairments are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, primarily from completed or planned store closures and software changes. 
               (b)   
    Represents impairments of undeveloped land.   
       
    43 

13. Other Noncurrent Assets 

(a)   
    Company-owned life insurance policies on approximately   4,000   team members who have been designated highly compensated under the Internal Revenue Code and have given their consent to be insured. Amounts are presented net of loans that are secured by some of these policies. 
               (b)   
    See Notes 8 and 19 for additional information relating to our interest rate swaps. 
       
    14. Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill totaled   $147 million   and   $151 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively.    No   impairments were recorded in 2014,   2013   or   2012   as a result of the goodwill impairment tests performed. 

(a)   
    Other intangible assets relate primarily to acquired customer lists and trademarks. 
       
  We use the straight-line method to amortize leasehold acquisition costs primarily over   9   to   39 years   and other definite-lived intangibles over   3   to   15 years  . The weighted average life of leasehold acquisition costs and other intangible assets was   26 years   and   7 years  , respectively, at   January 31, 2015  . Amortization expense was   $22 million  ,    $20 million   and   $16 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 

15. Accounts Payable 
    
  At   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , we reclassified book overdrafts of   $682 million   and   $716 million  , respectively, to accounts payable and   $82 million   and   $81 million   to accrued and other current liabilities. 
    
    44 

16. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities 

(a)   
    Straight-line rent accrual represents the amount of rent expense recorded that exceeds cash payments remitted in connection with operating leases. 
               (b)   
    We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to general liability and workers' compensation claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. 
       
    17. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Data Breach 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network (the Data Breach). Based on our investigation to date, we believe that the intruder installed malware on our point-of-sale system in our U.S. stores and stole payment card data from up to approximately   40 million   credit and debit card accounts of guests who shopped at our U.S. stores between November 27 and December 17, 2013. In addition, the intruder stole certain guest information, including names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses, for up to   70 million   individuals.  
    
  Payment Card Network Loss Contingencies 
    
  In the event of a data breach where payment card data is or may have been stolen, the payment card networks  contracts purport to give them the ability to make claims for reimbursement of incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs) that the payment card networks believe they or their issuing banks have incurred as a result of the event. For us to have liability for such claims, we believe that a court would have to find that, among other things, (1) at the time of the Data Breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards in a manner that contributed to the Data Breach, and (2) the network operating rules around reimbursement of operating costs and counterfeit fraud losses are enforceable. While an independent third-party assessor found the portion of our network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013 and late 2014, the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks claimed in first quarter 2014 that we were not in compliance with those standards at the time of the Data Breach.  
    
  During 2014, three of the four major payment card networks, which between them represent a substantial majority of the payment cards potentially impacted by the Data Breach, made written claims against us, either directly or through our acquiring banks. We believe it is probable that the fourth major payment card network will also make a claim against us. We expect to dispute the claims that have been or may be made against us by the payment card networks, and we think it is probable that our disputes would lead to settlement negotiations consistent with the experience of other entities that suffered similar payment card breaches. We believe such negotiations would effect a combined settlement of the payment card networks' counterfeit fraud loss allegations and their non-ordinary course operating expense allegations. Our accruals for estimated probable loss discussed below include accruals for what we believe to be the vast majority of both actual and potential claims from the payment card networks. 
    
    45 

Litigation and Governmental Investigations 
    
  In addition, more than   100   actions have been filed in courts in many states, along with one action in Canada, and other claims have been or may be asserted against us on behalf of guests, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising out of the Data Breach. State and federal agencies, including State Attorneys General, the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC, are investigating events related to the Data Breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. Our accruals for estimated probable loss discussed below include accruals for what we believe to be the vast majority of both actual and potential claims from these matters. 
    
  Expenses Incurred and Amounts Accrued     

(a)    
    Includes expenditures and accruals for Data Breach-related costs and expected insurance recoveries as discussed below. 
       
  During 2014, we recorded   $191 million   of Data Breach-related expenses, partially offset by expected insurance proceeds of   $46 million  , for net expenses of   $145 million  . Since the Data Breach, we have incurred   $252 million   of cumulative expenses, partially offset by expected insurance recoveries of   $90 million  , for net cumulative expenses of   $162 million  . These expenses were included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG A), but were not part of segment results. Along with legal and other professional services, these expenses include an accrual for estimated probable losses for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach related claims, including claims by the payment card networks. Our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable for the losses we have accrued were these claims to be litigated. Given the varying stages of claims and related proceedings, and the inherent uncertainty surrounding them, our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, historical precedents and an assessment of the validity of certain claims. Our estimates may change as new information becomes available, and although we do not believe it is probable, it is reasonably possible that we may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued. We are not able to estimate the amount of such reasonably possible excess loss exposure at this time because many of the matters are in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. The accrual does not reflect future breach-related legal, consulting or administrative fees, which are expensed as incurred and not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements in any individual period. 
    
  Insurance Coverage 
    
  To limit our exposure to losses relating to data breach and other claims, we maintain   $100 million   of network-security insurance coverage, above a   $10 million   deductible and with a   $50 million   sublimit for settlements with the payment card networks. This coverage, and certain other customary business-insurance coverage, has reduced our exposure related to the Data Breach. We will pursue recoveries to the maximum extent available under the policies. Since the Data Breach, we have received   $30 million   from our network-security insurance carriers. 
    
  Canada Exit 
    
  See Note 6 for information related to Canada Exit-related contingent liabilities. 
  Other Contingencies 
    
  We are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities.  We do not believe that any of these identified claims or litigation will be material to our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
    46 

Commitments 
    
  Purchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts, were   $2,411 million   and   $1,285 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. These purchase obligations are primarily due within   three years   and recorded as liabilities when inventory is received. We issue inventory purchase orders, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. Real estate obligations, which include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities, were $  243 million   and $  358 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. These real estate obligations are primarily due within   one year  , a portion of which are recorded as liabilities. 
  We issue letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of business. Trade letters of credit totaled   $1,447 million   and   $1,420 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively, a portion of which are reflected in accounts payable. Standby letters of credit and surety bonds, relating primarily to insurance and regulatory requirements, totaled   $459 million   and   $486 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. 
    
    18. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt 
    
  At   January 31, 2015  , the carrying value and maturities of our debt portfolio were as follows: 

(a)   
    Reflects the weighted average stated interest rate as of year-end. 

In June 2014, we issued   $1 billion   of unsecured fixed rate debt at   2.3%   that matures in June 2019 and   $1 billion   of unsecured fixed rate debt at   3.5%   that matures in July 2024.  We used proceeds from these issuances to repurchase   $725 million   of debt before its maturity at a market value of   $1 billion  , and for general corporate purposes including the payment of   $1 billion   of debt maturities. We recognized a loss of   $285 million   on the early retirement, which was recorded in net interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Concurrent with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, we repaid   $1.5 billion   of  nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (the 2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate). We also used   $1.4 billion   of proceeds from the transaction to repurchase, at market value, an additional   $970 million   of debt before its maturity.  We recognized a loss of   $445 million   on the early retirement, which was recorded in net interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  We periodically obtain short-term financing under our commercial paper program, a form of notes payable. 
    47 

No balances were outstanding at any time during 2014 or   2013   under our   $2.25 billion   revolving credit facility that expires in October 2018.  
    
  Substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are senior, unsecured obligations. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants, which have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends. 
    
    19. Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Our derivative instruments primarily consist of interest rate swaps, which are used to mitigate our interest rate risk. As a result of our use of derivative instruments, we have counterparty credit exposure to large global financial institutions. We monitor this concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis. See Note 8 for a description of the fair value measurement of our derivative instruments and their classification on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
    
  In June 2014, we entered into   two   interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of   $500 million  , under which we pay a variable rate and receive a fixed rate. In March 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of   $250 million  , under which we pay a variable rate and receive a fixed rate. We designated these swaps as fair value hedges. As of   February 1, 2014  ,   one   swap was designated as a fair value hedge.    No   ineffectiveness was recognized in   2014   or   2013  . 

(a)   
    There are   three   designated swaps at January 31, 2015.   Two   swaps have floating pay rates equal to   3-month LIBOR   and   one   swap has a floating pay rate equal to   1-month LIBOR  . 

48 

Periodic payments, valuation adjustments and amortization of gains or losses on our derivative contracts had the following impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations: 

The amount remaining on unamortized hedged debt valuation gains from terminated or de-designated interest rate swaps that will be amortized into earnings over the remaining lives of the underlying debt totaled   $34 million  ,   $52 million   and   $75 million  , at the end of   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
    20. Leases 
    
  We lease certain retail locations, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, land, equipment and software. Assets held under capital leases are included in property and equipment. Operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease beginning on the date we take possession of the property. At lease inception, we determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. The lease term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term. 
  Rent expense is included in SG A expenses. Some of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These expenses are classified in SG A, consistent with similar costs for owned locations. Rent income received from tenants who rent properties is recorded as a reduction to SG A expense. 

Total capital lease interest expense was   $38 million  ,   $39 million   and   $31 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively,  and is included within net interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Most leases include   one   or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from   one   to   50 years   or more. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. Assets recorded under capital leases as of   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014   were   $711 million   and   $698 million  , respectively.  These assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of   $242 million   and   $167 million   as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively.  
    
    49 

Note: Minimum lease payments exclude payments to landlords for real estate taxes and common area maintenance. Minimum lease payments also exclude payments to landlords for fixed purchase options which we believe are reasonably assured of being exercised.  
            (a)   
    Total contractual lease payments include   $2,046 million   related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes   $67 million   of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2015 or later.  
               (b)   
    Capital lease payments include   $612 million   related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes   $59 million   of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2015 or later. Capital leases also include   $41 million   of legally binding payments for distribution centers opening in 2015. 
               (c)   
    Calculated using the interest rate at inception for each lease. 
               (d)   
    Includes the current portion of   $63 million  . 
       
    21. Income Taxes 
    
  Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were   $3,653 million  ,   $4,121 million   and   $5,056 million   during   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , including   $261 million  ,   $196 million   and   $161 million   earned by our foreign entities subject to tax outside of the U.S. 

50 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date. 
  We have not recorded deferred taxes when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. These accumulated net earnings relate to certain ongoing operations and were   $328 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   $64 million   at   February 1, 2014  . It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were repatriated. 
  We file a U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed exams on the U.S. federal income tax returns for years 2010 and prior. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. 

If we were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded,   $101 million   of the   $155 million   reserve would benefit the effective tax rate. In addition, the reversal of accrued penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax expense. During the years ended   January 31, 2015  ,   February 1, 2014   and February 2, 2013, we recorded a net benefit from the reversal of accrued penalties and interest of   $12 million  ,   $1 million   and   $16 million  , respectively. As of   January 31, 2015  ,   February 1, 2014   and   February 2, 2013   total accrued interest and penalties were   $40 million  ,   $58 million   and   $64 million  , respectively. 
  It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to our other unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next   twelve months  ; however, an estimate of the amount or range of the change cannot be made at this time.

22. Other Noncurrent Liabilities 

(a)   
    See footnote (c) to the Accrued and Other Current Liabilities table in Note 16 for additional detail. 
       
    23. Share Repurchase 
    
  We repurchase shares primarily through open market transactions under a   $5 billion   share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2012. No shares were repurchased through open market transactions since the first half of 2013.  

(a)   
    Includes   0.8 million  ,   0.2 million   and   0.5 million   shares delivered upon the non-cash settlement of prepaid contracts in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  These contracts had an original cash investment of   $41 million  ,   $14 million   and   $25 million  , respectively, and an aggregate market value of   $46 million  ,   $17 million   and   $29 million  . These contracts are among the investment vehicles used to reduce our economic exposure related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Note 25 provides the details of our positions in prepaid forward contracts. 
       
    24. Share-Based Compensation 
    
  We maintain a long-term incentive plan (the Plan) for key team members and non-employee members of our Board of Directors. The Plan allows us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or a combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards). The number of unissued common shares reserved for future grants under the Plan was   14.0 million   and   18.7 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. 
  Compensation expense associated with share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the minimum required service period. Share-based compensation expense for continuing operations recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was   $73 million  ,   $106 million   and   $101 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The related income tax benefit was   $29 million  ,   $41 million   and   $40 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
  Share information includes all outstanding awards for continuing and discontinued operations. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  Through 2013, we granted nonqualified stock options to certain team members that generally vest and become exercisable annually in equal amounts over a   four  -year period and expire   10 years   after the grant date. We previously granted options with a ten-year term to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors that vest immediately, but are not exercisable until   one   year after the grant date. We used a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at the grant date.

At   January 31, 2015  , there was   $15 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   0.8   years. The weighted average remaining life of exercisable options is   5.0   years, and the weighted average remaining life of all outstanding options is   5.5   years. The total fair value of options vested was   $37 million  ,   $53 million   and   $68 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  Performance Share Units 
    
  We issue performance share units to certain team members that represent shares potentially issuable in the future. Issuance is based upon our performance relative to a retail peer group over a   three  -year performance period on certain  measures including domestic market share change, return on invested capital and EPS growth. The fair value of performance share units is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value for performance share units was   $73.12  ,   $57.22   and   $58.61   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.

               (b)   
    Weighted average per unit. 
       
  The expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. Future compensation expense for unvested awards could reach a maximum of   $145 million   assuming payout of all unvested awards. The unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.2 years  . The fair value of performance share units vested and converted was   $11 million   in   2014  ,   $14 million   in   2013   and   $16 million   in   2012  . 
    
  Restricted Stock 
    
  We issue restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units with   three  -year cliff vesting from the grant date (collectively restricted stock) to certain team members. The final number of shares issued under  performance-based restricted stock units will be based on our total shareholder return relative to a retail peer group over a three-year performance period. We also regularly issue restricted stock units to our Board of Directors, which vest quarterly over a   one  -year period and are settled in shares of Target common stock upon departure from the Board. The fair value for restricted stock is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant, incorporating an analysis of the total shareholder return performance measure where applicable. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted stock was   $70.50  ,   $62.76   and   $60.44   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 

(a)   
    Represents the number of restricted stock units, in thousands. For performance-based restricted stock units, assumes attainment of maximum payout rates as set forth in the performance criteria based in thousands of share units. Applying actual or expected payout rates, the number of outstanding restricted stock units at   January 31, 2015   was   3,897 thousand  . 
               (b)   
    Weighted average per unit. 
       
  The expense recognized each period is partially dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. At   January 31, 2015  , there was   $154 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.3   years. The fair value of restricted stock vested and converted to shares of Target common stock was   $40 million  ,   $28 million   and   $11 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
    25. Defined Contribution Plans 
    
  Team members who meet eligibility requirements can participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan by investing up to   80 percent   of their compensation, as limited by statute or regulation. Generally, we match   100 percent   of each team member's contribution up to   5 percent   of total compensation. Company match contributions are made to funds designated by the participant. 
  In addition, we maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for approximately   2,800   current and retired team members whose participation in our 401(k) plan is limited by statute or regulation. These team members  
    54 

choose from a menu of crediting rate alternatives that are the same as the investment choices in our 401(k) plan, including Target common stock. We credit an additional   2 percent   per year to the accounts of all active participants, excluding executive officers, in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation in this plan. We also maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan that was frozen during 1996, covering approximately   55   participants, all of whom are no longer at Target. In this plan, deferred compensation earns returns tied to market levels of interest rates plus an additional   6 percent   return, with a minimum of   12 percent   and a maximum of   20 percent  , as determined by the plan's terms. Our total liability under these plans was   $539 million   and   $520 million   at   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  , respectively. 
  We mitigate some of our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through investing in vehicles, including company-owned life insurance and prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock, that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These investment vehicles are general corporate assets and are marked to market with the related gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur. 
  The total change in fair value for contracts indexed to our own common stock recognized in earnings was pretax income/(loss) of   $11 million  ,   $(5) million   and   $14 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. During   2014  , we made no investments in prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock. In   2013  , we invested   $23 million   in such investment instruments, and this activity is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within other investing activities. Adjusting our position in these investment vehicles may involve repurchasing shares of Target common stock when settling the forward contracts as described in Note 23. The settlement dates of these instruments are regularly renegotiated with the counterparty.

    Includes market-performance credits on accumulated participant account balances and annual crediting for additional benefits earned during the year. 
               (b)   
    Includes investment returns and life-insurance proceeds received from company-owned life insurance policies and other investments used to economically hedge the cost of these plans. 
       
    26. Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans 
    
  We have qualified defined benefit pension plans covering team members who meet age and service requirements, including date of hire in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 2009, our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants, with limited exceptions.  We also have unfunded nonqualified pension plans for team members with qualified plan compensation restrictions. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on each team members' date of hire, length of service and/or team member compensation. Upon early retirement and prior to Medicare eligibility, team members also become eligible for certain health care benefits if they meet minimum age and service requirements and agree to contribute a portion of the cost.

    57 

Assumptions 

The weighted average assumptions used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year are the rates as of the beginning of the year (i.e., the prior measurement date). Based on a stable asset allocation, our most recent compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was   12.1 percent  ,   8.3 percent  ,   7.0 percent   and   9.7 percent   for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year time periods, respectively. 
  The market-related value of plan assets, which is used in calculating expected return on assets in net periodic benefit cost, is determined each year by adjusting the previous year's value by expected return, benefit payments and cash contributions. The market-related value is adjusted for asset gains and losses in equal   20 percent   adjustments over a   five  -year period. 
  We review the expected long-term rate of return annually, and revise it as appropriate. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long-term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets. Our expected annualized long-term rate of return assumptions as of   January 31, 2015   were   8.0 percent   for domestic and international equity securities,   5.0 percent   for long-duration debt securities,   8.0 percent   for balanced funds and   9.5 percent   for other investments. These estimates are a judgmental matter in which we consider the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions.  
  An increase in the cost of covered health care benefits of   7.0 percent   was assumed for   2014   and   7.0 percent   is assumed for   2015  . The rate will be reduced to   5.0 percent   in 2019 and thereafter.

Plan Assets 
    
  Our asset allocation policy is designed to reduce the long-term cost of funding our pension obligations. The plan invests with both passive and active investment managers depending on the investment's asset class. The plan also seeks to reduce the risk associated with adverse movements in interest rates by employing an interest rate hedging program, which may include the use of interest rate swaps, total return swaps and other instruments. 
    
    58 

(a)   
    Equity securities include our common stock in amounts substantially less than   1 percent   of total plan assets as of   January 31, 2015   and   February 1, 2014  . 
               (b)   
    Other assets include private equity, mezzanine and high-yield debt, natural resources and timberland funds, multi-strategy hedge funds, derivative instruments and a   4 percent   allocation to real  estate.

Position 
      
    Valuation Technique 
      Cash and cash equivalents 
      
    These investments are cash holdings and investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV for the investment vehicles is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus applicable costs and liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
      Equity securities 
      
    Valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. 
      Common collective trusts/ balanced funds/ certain multi-strategy hedge funds 
      
    Valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted transactional price for participants in the fund, which do not represent an active market. 
      Fixed income and government securities 
      
    Valued using matrix pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. 
      Private equity/ real estate/ certain multi-strategy hedge funds/ other 
      
    Valued by deriving Target's proportionate share of equity investment from audited financial statements. Private equity and real estate investments require significant judgment on the part of the fund manager due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the long term of such investments. Certain multi-strategy hedge funds represent funds of funds that include liquidity restrictions and for which timely valuation information is not available. 

Contributions 
    
  Our obligations to plan participants can be met over time through a combination of company contributions to these plans and earnings on plan assets. In 2014, we made a discretionary contribution of   $150 million   to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. In 2013, we made no contributions. We are not required to make any contributions in 2015. However, depending on investment performance and plan funded status, we may elect to make a contribution. We expect to make contributions in the range of   $4 million   to   $5 million   to our postretirement health care benefit plan in 2015.

28. Segment Reporting 
    
  Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions. Effective January 15, 2015, following the deconsolidation of our Canadian retail operation, we operate as a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations, which are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores, online or through mobile devices.  

Note: The sum of the segment amounts may not equal the total amounts due to rounding. 
             (b)

At February 1, 2014, represents the beneficial interest asset of   $127 million   and insurance receivable related to the Data Breach of   $44 million  . 
       
    29. Subsequent Event 
    
  In March 2015, we announced a headquarters workforce reduction. As a result, we expect to record approximately   $100 million   of severance and other benefits-related charges within SG A in the first quarter of 2015, the vast majority of which are expected to require cash expenditures.

30. Quarterly Results (Unaudited) 
    
  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, fourth quarter operating results typically represent a substantially larger share of total year revenues and earnings because they include our peak sales period from Thanksgiving through the end of December. We follow the same accounting policies for preparing quarterly and annual financial data. The table below summarizes quarterly results for   2014   and   2013  : 

Note: Per share amounts are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the quarters may not equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes in average quarterly shares outstanding and all other quarterly amounts may not equal the total year due to rounding.

  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  We have continued to expand our implementation of enterprise resource planning software from SAP AG, including the implementation in October 2014 of functionality of customer relationship management. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  For the Report of Management on Internal Control and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
    
    Item 9B.    Other Information 
    
  On March 13, 2015, we entered into an Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement with Brian C. Cornell, our chief executive officer, with respect to Mr. Cornell s personal use of company-provided aircraft.  The agreement was entered into in furtherance of the terms of the offer of employment to Mr. Cornell described in the Offer Letter filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on August 27, 2014, and is intended to require Mr. Cornell to reimburse us for the incremental costs of using company-provided aircraft for personal purposes, if such personal use exceeds the $175,000 annual limitation described in the offer letter.

Exhibit (10)AA 

Target Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
    
  NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR 
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
    
  THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ) is made in Minneapolis, Minnesota as of the date of grant (the  Grant Date ) set forth in the award letter (the  Award Letter ) by and between the Company and the person (the  Director ) identified in the Award Letter.  This award (the  Award ) of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ), provided to you as a member of the Board, is being issued under the Target Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), subject to the following terms and conditions. 
    
  1.      Definitions  .  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the defined terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  The term  Committee  shall also include those persons to whom authority has been delegated under the Plan. 
    
  2.      Grant of RSUs  .  Subject to the relevant terms of the Plan and this Agreement, as of the Grant Date, the Company has granted the Director the number of RSUs set forth in the Award Letter. 
    
  3.      Vesting Schedule  .  Beginning with the calendar quarter in which the Grant Date occurs, 25% of the RSUs shall vest on the last day of each calendar quarter of the year in which the Grant Date occurs (i.e., March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31) and any remaining RSUs shall become fully vested on December 31 of the year in which the Grant Date occurs (the  Final Vesting Date ). 
    
  4.      Circumstances that Accelerate the Vesting Date  .  All unvested RSUs subject to this Agreement shall become immediately vested if the Director ceases to be a member of the Board due to (a) death, (b) Disability, (c) reaching the mandatory retirement age for members of the Board, or (d) reaching the maximum term limit for members of the Board. 
    
  In the event a Change in Control occurs prior to the Final Vesting Date, a pro-rata portion of the RSUs shall become immediately vested, to the extent not already vested.  For this purpose a pro-rata portion of the RSUs shall be determined by multiplying the aggregate RSUs subject to the Award by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months that have elapsed since the Grant Date (rounded to the nearest whole month) and the denominator is 12. 

5.      Effect of Ceasing to be a Member of the Board  .  In the event that the Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason prior to the Final Vesting Date, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the unvested portion of the Award shall be forfeited. 
    
  6.      Dividend Equivalents  .  The Director shall have the right to receive additional RSUs with a value equal to the regular cash dividend paid on one Share for each RSU held pursuant to this Agreement prior to the conversion of RSUs and issuance of Shares pursuant to Section 7.  The number of additional RSUs to be received as dividend equivalents for each RSU held shall be determined by dividing the cash dividend per share by the Fair Market Value of one Share on the dividend payment date; provided, however, that for purposes of avoiding the issuance of fractional RSUs, on each dividend payment date the additional RSUs issued as dividend equivalents shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

SECTION 1 
  INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS 
  1.1        Name of Plan; History.    This Plan (formerly known as the  Target Corporation SMG Executive Officer Deferred Compensation Plan) is a non-qualified, unfunded plan established for the purpose of allowing a select group of management or highly compensated employees to defer the receipt of income.  This Plan was originally adopted effective as of January 1, 1997 and was amended at various times thereafter.  Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the supplemental pension plans maintained by the Company.  Each subsequent April, the Participant receives annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credits equal to the change in value of his or her benefit under the supplemental pension plans.  Effective July 31, 2002, this program was extended to include all officers of the Company.  Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the Company s ESBP.  Each subsequent April, Participants received annual credits equal to the change in value of his or her benefit under the ESBP.  Effective October 28, 2005, all officers who had not previously received ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits, received a one-time transfer of the present value of their benefit under the ESBP.  As of January 28, 2006, a one-time ESBP credit was made to certain executive committee members and no subsequent ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits were made to those receiving the one-time ESBP credit.  From time to time, certain participants in the Target Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan   Senior Management Group ( ODCP ) and the Company negotiated to transfer the economic value of their benefit under ODCP to this Plan.  Officers eligible to receive performance share awards granted in the fiscal years ending February 1, 2003 and January 31, 2004 had an opportunity to defer receipt of the value of the earned performance shares into this Plan at the end of the performance period.  The performance period for the shares granted in 2003 ended February 3, 2007.  The performance period for the shares granted in 2004 ended February 2, 2008.  Effective January 1, 2005 (and other effective dates as specifically provided), this Plan was operated in compliance with Code section 409A.  Effective January 29, 2006, members of the Company s executive committee ceased to be eligible to receive enhanced earnings on their account balances.  The Plan, which is intended to comply with Code section 409A, was amended and restated effective January 1, 2009.  The Plan was amended and restated to incorporate the Company s recoupment policy effective January 13, 2010.  The Plan was amended and restated to reflect Plan administration and amendment changes authorized by the Board on November 10, 2010, to modify the Change in Control definition, and to set forth special provisions that are applicable to certain Participants who transfer to Canada, effective as of June 8, 2011.  The Plan was amended and restated to reflect the replacement of the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative with the Intermediate-Term Bond Crediting Rate Alternative beginning June 6, 2012, effective as of June 5, 2012.  The Plan was amended and restated to revise the method for distributing the final SPP Transfer Credit following a Termination of Employment for amounts accruing on or after January 1, 2014, to clarify the differences between  executive officer  and  member of the executive committee,  and to clarify the timing of certain post-death payments, effective December 1, 2013.  The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2014 to freeze that portion of the annual SPP Transfer Credit that arises from a positive accrual under SPP III after February 3, 2013 solely from treating the Participant as five years older than his or her actual age for purposes of determining the amount of the annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credit.  This Plan Statement was amended and restated effective January 1, 2015 (i) to revise the participation rules for Participants who are transferred to Canada on a temporary basis, (ii) to modify the Restoration Match Credit determination to cover Participants who are entitled to differing qualified 401(k) plan matching contribution percentages, (iii) to change the phrase  member of the executive committee  to 

executive Officer  each place the phrase appears, and (iv) to define the term executive Officer to mean a Section 16 officer or executive officer as defined under Federal securities laws.

     6.2.3        Installment Amounts.    The amount of the annual installments shall be determined by dividing the amount of the vested portion of the Account as of the most recent Valuation Date preceding the date the installment is being paid by the number of remaining installment payments to be made (including the payment being determined). 
  6.2.4        Small Benefit.    Subject to Section 6.3,     in the event that the vested Account balance of a Participant who has died or experienced a Termination of Employment under the Plan is less than the applicable dollar amount under Code section 402(g)(1)(B) for that Plan Year as of the date on which the Plan Administrator makes such determinations, the Plan Administrator (on behalf of the Company) reserves the right to have the Participant s entire Account paid in the form of a single lump sum payment, provided the Plan Administrator s  exercise of discretion (on behalf of the Company) complies with the requirements of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(v).

              (ii) 
    Each monthly installment payment will be determined by dividing: (A) the amount of the vested portion of the Account attributable to Appendix A, Section A-4.3 and an amount of Earnings Credits equal to the investment adjustment that would have been credited on such SPP Benefit Transfer Credits at the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative through  the most recent Valuation Date preceding the earlier of June 5, 2012 or date the installment is due, and after June 5, 2012, at the Intermediate-Term Bond Crediting Rate Alternative through the most recent Valuation Date preceding the date the installment is due, by (B) twenty-four (24), less the number of monthly installment payments that have previously been made from the Plan. 
              (c) 
    In all other cases - a single lump sum payment within 60 days following the Participant s Termination of Employment.

              (i) 
    Lump Sum Distribution.

              (ii) 
    Installment Distribution.    If Deferral or Restoration Match Credits are due after a related installment distribution occurs, then such subsequent credits will be made to the Account and included in the Account balance to determine the amount of the remaining scheduled payments as applicable. 
              (b) 
    SPP or ESBP Benefit Transfer Credit.    The SPP Benefit Transfer Credit other than those pursuant to Appendix A, Section A-4.3 or ESBP Benefit Transfer Credit, as applicable, arising after a Participant s Termination of Employment pursuant to Sections 3.3.3(f) and 3.4.1(e) shall be distributed as follows:   
              (i) 
    For amounts accruing prior to January 1, 2014, in a single lump sum within 60 days following the Termination of Employment; and 
        23 

(A) 
    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due after the complete distribution of the Participant s vested Account balance, or subaccount balance to which such Credit relates, then such Credit will be made to the Account and paid to the Participant in a single lump sum payment within 60 days of being credited to the Account;  
              (B) 
    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due after a related installment distribution occurs, then such subsequent Credit will be made to the Account and included in the Account balance to determine the amount of the remaining scheduled payments as applicable; and 
              (C) 
    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due prior to the commencement of payment to which such credit relates, distribution shall be made at the time and in the manner elected by the Participant or pursuant to the Plan s rule, all as provided in Section 6.2.2. 
       
  6.2.7        Vesting in Benefits After the Distribution Date.    No portion of a Participant s Account will be distributed prior to being vested.  Subject to Section 6.3, if Participant is scheduled to receive a distribution of a portion of his or her Account that is not vested, such unvested amount will not be paid until subsequently vested, at which time it will be paid out in accordance with the respective distribution election. 
  6.2.8        No Spousal Rights.    No spouse, former spouse, Beneficiary or other person shall have any right to participate in the Participant s designation of a form or time of payment. 
  6.3        Six-Month Suspension for Specified Employees.    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6 to the contrary, if a Participant is a Specified Employee at Termination of Employment, then any distributions arising on account of the Participant s Termination of Employment (other than on account of death) that are due shall be suspended and not be made until (6) months have elapsed since such Participant s Termination of Employment (or, if earlier, upon the date of the Participant s death).  Any payments that were otherwise payable during the six-month suspension period referred to in the preceding sentence, will be paid within 60 days after the end of such six-month suspension period. 
  6.4        Distribution on Account of Death; Distribution Following Death.    Upon the death of a Participant prior to Termination of Employment or other distribution trigger, the Participant s Account balance will be paid to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum within 90 days following the Participant s death.  Upon the death of a Participant following Termination of Employment or other distribution trigger, distribution will continue in the same form and at the same time it was scheduled to be paid to the Participant, subject to Section 6.3. 
  6.5        Distribution on Account of Unforeseeable Emergency. 
  6.5.1        When Available.    A Participant may receive a distribution from the vested portion of his or her Account (which shall be deemed to include the deferral that would have been made but for the cancellation under Section 6.5.3) if the Plan Administrator determines that such distribution is on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency and the conditions in Section 6.5.2 have been fulfilled.  To receive such a distribution, the Participant must request a distribution by  
    24 

filing an application with the Plan Administrator and furnish such supporting documentation as the Plan Administrator may require.  In the application, the Participant shall specify the basis for the distribution and the dollar amount to be distributed.  If such request is approved by the Plan Administrator, distribution shall be made in a lump sum payment within 60 days following the approval by the Plan Administrator of the completed application. 
  6.5.2        Limitations  .  The amount that may be distributed with respect to a Participant s Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy the emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), and/or cancellation of deferrals pursuant to Section 6.5.3, provided the determination of such limitation is consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii). 
  6.5.3        Cancellation of Deferral Elections.    As provided by Section 2.12, in the event of a distribution under Section 6.5.1 the Plan Administrator will cancel the Participant s deferral elections for the balance of the applicable Plan Year. 
  6.6        Designation of Beneficiaries  . 
  6.6.1        Right to Designate or Revoke. 
           (a) 
    Each Participant may designate one or more primary Beneficiaries or secondary Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant s vested Account in the event of such Participant s death.  If fewer than all designated primary or secondary Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the amount of such predeceased Beneficiary s portion shall be allocated to the remaining primary or secondary Beneficiaries, as the case may be. 
              (b) 
    The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any spouse, any person named as Beneficiary or any other person. 
              (c) 
    No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless completed and filed with the Plan Administrator in accordance with Plan Rules during the Participant s lifetime. 
     6.6.2        Failure of Designation.    If a Participant: 
           (a) 
    fails to designate a Beneficiary, 
              (b) 
    designates a Beneficiary and thereafter revokes such designation without naming another Beneficiary, or 
              (c) 
    designates one or more Beneficiaries and all such Beneficiaries so designated fail to survive the Participant, such Participant s vested Account, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries: 
     Participant s surviving spouse 
  Representative of Participant s estate 
    
    25 

6.6.3        Disclaimers by Beneficiaries  .  A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of a deceased Participant s vested Account may disclaim an interest therein subject to the Plan Rules. 
  6.6.4        Special Rules.    Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant s Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply: 
           (a) 
    If there is not sufficient evidence that a person designated as a Beneficiary was living at the time of the death of the Participant, it shall be deemed that the Beneficiary was not living at the time of the death of the Participant. 
              (b) 
    The automatic Beneficiaries specified in Section 6.6.2 and the Beneficiaries designated by the Participant shall become fixed at the time of the Participant s death (subject to Section 6.6.3) so that, if a Beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before the receipt of all payments due such Beneficiary hereunder, such remaining payments shall be payable to the representative of such Beneficiary s estate. 
              (c) 
    If the Participant designates as a Beneficiary the person who is the Participant s spouse on the date of the designation, either by name or by relationship, or both, the dissolution, annulment or other legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such person shall automatically revoke such designation.  The foregoing shall not prevent the Participant from designating a former spouse as a beneficiary on a form that is both executed by the Participant and received by the Plan Administrator (i) after the date of the legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such former spouse and (ii) during the Participant s lifetime. 
              (d) 
    A finalized marriage (other than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to the date of filing of a Beneficiary designation shall revoke such designation unless the Participant s new spouse had previously been designated as the Beneficiary. 
              (e) 
    Any designation of a nonspouse Beneficiary by name that is accompanied by a description of relationship to the Participant shall be given effect without regard to whether the relationship to the Participant exists either then or at the Participant s death. 
              (f) 
    Any designation of a Beneficiary only by statement of relationship to the Participant shall be effective only to designate the person or persons standing in such relationship to the Participant at the Participant s death. 
     6.7        Facility of Payment. 
  6.7.1        Legal Disability.    In case of the legal disability, including minority, of an individual entitled to receive any payment under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Plan Administrator shall be advised of the existence of such condition: 
           (a) 
    to the duly appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such individual, or 
       26 

(b) 
    to a person or institution entrusted with the care or maintenance of the incompetent or disable Participant or Beneficiary, provided such person or institution has satisfied the Plan Administrator that the payment will be used for the best interest and assist in the care of such individual, and provided further, that no prior claim for said payment has been made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such individual. 
     6.7.2        Discharge of Liability.    Any payment made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 shall constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the Participating Employers under this Plan. 
  6.8        Tax Withholding.    The Participating Employer (or any other person legally obligated to do so) shall withhold the amount of any federal, state or local income tax, payroll tax or other tax that the payer reasonably determines is required to be withheld under applicable law with respect to any amount payable under this Plan.  All benefits otherwise due hereunder shall be reduced by the amount to be withheld. 
  6.9        Payments Upon Rehire.    If a Participant who is receiving installment payments or due a deferred lump sum payment under this Plan is rehired, the payments will continue in accordance with the prior distribution elections. 
  6.10        Application for Distribution.    A Participant may be required to make application to receive payment and to complete other forms and furnish other documentation required by the Plan Administrator.  Distribution shall not be made to any Beneficiary until such Beneficiary shall have filed an application for benefits in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator and such application shall have been approved by the Plan Administrator and the Plan Administrator has determined that the applicant is entitled to payment. 
  6.11        Acceleration of Distributions.    The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion on behalf of the Company to accelerate the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A. 
  6.12        Delay of Distributions.    The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion on behalf of the Company to delay the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A, including, but not limited to, as necessary to maximize the Company s tax deductions as allowed pursuant to Code section 162(m) or to avoid violation of federal securities or other applicable law. 
    27 

SECTION 7 
  SOURCE OF PAYMENTS; NATURE OF INTEREST 
  7.1        Source of Payments. 
  7.1.1        General Assets.    Each Participating Employer will pay, from its general assets, the distribution of the Participant s Account under Section 6, and all costs, charges and expenses relating thereto. 
  7.1.2        Trust.    Upon a Change-in-Control that causes the Plan to be terminated under Section 8.3.2, the trustee of the Trust will make distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries from the Trust in satisfaction of a Participating Employer s obligations to make distributions under this Plan in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Trust to the extent such payments are not otherwise made directly by the Participating Employer. 
  7.2        Unfunded Obligation.    The obligation of the Participating Employers to make payments under this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to make such payments.  Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company. 
  7.3        Establishment of Trust.    The Participating Employers shall have no obligation to establish or maintain any fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan except as provided in the Trust.  The Participating Employers may from time to time transfer to the Trust cash, or other marketable securities or other property acceptable to the trustee in accordance with the terms of the Trust.  If the Participating Employers have deposited funds in the Trust, such funds shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Participating Employer that deposited such funds. 
  7.4        Spendthrift Provision.    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.4, no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any Account which can be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person. 
  7.4.1        Right to Designate Beneficiary.    The power to designate Beneficiaries to receive the Account of a Participant in the event of such Participant s death shall not permit or be construed to permit such power or right to be exercised by the Participant     so as thereby to anticipate, pledge, mortgage or encumber such Participant s Account or any part thereof, and any attempt of a Participant so to exercise said power in violation of this provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be disregarded by the Participating Employers. 
  7.4.2        Plan Administrator s Right to Exercise Discretion.    This Section 7.4 shall not prevent the Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof. 
    28 

7.5        Compensation Recovery (Recoupment).    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a Participant who engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to the need for a restatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements and who becomes subject to the Company s recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors and amended from time to time ( Recoupment Policy ) may have all or a portion of his or her benefit under this Plan forfeited and/or all or a portion of any distributions payable to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary recovered by the Company. 
  7.5.1        Any Deferral Credit and related Earnings Credits resulting from the deferral of Eligible Compensation that is subject to recovery under the Recoupment Policy may be forfeited and, in such event, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the Participant s Account balance. 
  7.5.2        If a Participant has commenced distributions and is subject to a claim for recovery under the Recoupment Policy, then the Company may, subject to any limitations under Code section 409A, retain all or any portion of the Participant s (or his or her Beneficiary s) taxable distribution, net of state, federal or foreign tax withholding, to satisfy such claim. 
    29 

SECTION 8 
  ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
  8.1        Adoption.    With the prior approval of the Plan Administrator, an Affiliate may adopt the Plan and become a Participating Employer by furnishing to the Plan Administrator a certified copy of a resolution of its board of directors adopting this Plan. 
  8.2        Amendment. 
  8.2.1        General Rule.        The Company, by action of its Board of Directors, or by action of a person so authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to any limitations or conditions in such authorization, may at any time amend the Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate the Plan for future deferrals provided, however, that no amendment shall be effective to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under the Plan to any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the date of such amendment.  Written notice of any amendment shall be given each Participant then participating in the Plan.   
  8.2.2        Amendment to Benefit of Executive Officer.    Any amendment to the benefit of an executive Officer under this Plan, to the extent approval of such amendment by the Board would be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board. 
  8.2.3        No Oral Amendments.    No modification of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in writing.  No oral representation concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be effective to amend this Plan Statement. 
  8.3        Termination and Liquidation. 
  8.3.1        General Rule. 
           (a) 
    To the extent necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any time terminate and liquidate this Plan, provided such termination and liquidation satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A. 
              (b) 
    To the extent that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A, the Board may terminate and liquidate this Plan,     in whole or in part, as it relates to the impacted Participant. 
     8.3.2        Plan Termination and Liquidation on Account of a Change-in-Control.    Upon a Change-in-Control, the Plan will terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if and to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2. 
           (a) 
    The Plan will be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.8, and (ii) a funding of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the  Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated as of such  
       30 

effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to irrevocably terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such date. 
           (b) 
    The determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A, including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below. 
              (c) 
    In the event the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as provided in paragraph (a), such termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows: 
              (i) 
    If the Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon a administratively practicable but not more than 90 days following the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) have been satisfied. 
              (ii) 
    If the Change-in-Control does not qualify as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but not more than 60 days following the 12 month anniversary of the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C) have been satisfied.

APPENDIX A 
  SPP Benefit 
  A-1  Purpose and Application.    The purpose of this Appendix A to this Plan Statement is to establish the rules for determining the amount of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit under this Plan. 
  A-2        Background. 
  A-2.1        Transfer Credits.      The Company has adopted and maintained several nonqualified supplemental pension plans to provide retirement income to a select group of highly compensated and key management employees in excess of the retirement income that can be provided under the Target Pension Plan on account of limitations imposed by the Code.  Effective April 30, 2002, the Company began converting the accrued supplemental pension benefits of certain participants to credits under this Plan as adjusted annually to reflect changes in such benefits. 
  A-2.2        Cash Balance Formula  .    Effective January 1, 2003, the Target Pension Plan was amended to add a cash balance pension plan formula (referred to as the  personal pension account ).  Depending on the date participation commences or an election was made, a Participant who has a benefit under the Target Pension Plan may have his or her accrued benefit under such plan based solely on the final average pay formula (the  traditional formula ), solely on the personal pension account, or a combination of the traditional formula (frozen as of December 31, 2002) and the personal pension account. 
  A-3        Definitions. 
  A-3.1        SPP I       SPP I  means the Target Corporation SPP I. 
  A-3.2        SPP II       SPP II  means the Target Corporation SPP II. 
  A-3.3        SPP III       SPP III  means the Target Corporation SPP III. 
  A-4        SPP Benefit.    Each Participant s SPP Benefit is equal to the sum of the benefits under Section A-4.1, Section A-4.2 and Section A-4.3. 
  A-4.1        Traditional Formula Benefit.    A Participant s SPP Benefit is the excess, if any, of the monthly pension benefit under (a) over the monthly pension benefit under (b): 
           (a) 
    The monthly pension benefit the Participant would be entitled to under the Target Pension Plan, based on the  traditional formula,  if such formula were applied 
              (i) 
    without regard to the maximum benefit limitation required by Code section 415; 
              (ii) 
    without regard to the maximum compensation limitation under Code section 401(a)(17); 
              (iii) 
    as if the definition of  certified earnings  under the Target Pension Plan for a plan year included compensation that would have been paid in the plan year in the absence of the Participant s election to defer payment of  
       39 

the compensation to a later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan; 
           (iv) 
    without regard to the alternative benefit formula of Sections 4.6(a)(3) and 4.6(b)(2) of the Target Pension  Plan. 
              (b) 
    The monthly pension benefit the Participant is entitled to receive under the Target Pension Plan on account of the  traditional formula.  
     A-4.2        Personal Pension Account.    A Participant s SPP Benefit includes the excess, if any, of the amount determined under (a) over the amount determined under (b): 
           (a) 
    The amount that would have been credited each quarter (including both  pay credits  and  interest credits ) to the Participant s  personal pension account  under the Target Pension Plan, if such account were applied: 
              (i) 
    without regard to the maximum benefit limitations required by Code section 415; 
              (ii) 
    without regard to the maximum compensation limitation under Code section 401(a)(17); 
              (iii) 
    as if the definition of  certified earnings  under the Target Pension Plan for a calendar quarter included compensation that would have been paid during such calendar quarter in the absence of the Participant s election to defer payment of the compensation to a later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan; 
              (iv) 
    as if a distribution had been made from such account equal to any SPP Benefit Transfer Credits made under Section 3.3. 
              (b) 
    The amount of the credits actually made to the Participant s  personal pension account  under the Target Pension Plan. 
     A-4.3        SPP III.    For a Participant who was participating in SPP III, the Participant s SPP Benefit includes the actuarial equivalent lump sum present value of the monthly pension benefit under (a) over the monthly pension benefit under (b): 
           (a) 
    The monthly pension benefits determined under Section A-4.1(a) determined by treating the Participant as five (5) years older than his or her actual age solely for purposes of determining the early commencement factor (but in no case shall the Participant s age be deemed to be greater than age 65); provided, however, the early commencement factor shall be equal to the factor in effect under this Paragraph (a) on February 1, 2013, or, if greater, the Participant s actual early commencement factor under the Target Pension Plan. 
              (b) 
    The monthly pension benefits determined under Section A-4.1(a). 
     A-4.4        Company Determination.    The actuarial lump sum present value of a Participant s benefit determined under this Appendix A will be determined by the Company, in  
    40 

its sole and absolute discretion, by using such factors and assumptions as the Company considers appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion as of the date of distribution or transfer. 
  A-5        Forfeiture of SPP III Benefit. 
  A-5.1        Pre-Age 55 SPP III Forfeiture.        A Participant who has a Termination of Employment prior to attaining age 55 will forfeit that portion of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer Credit and Earnings Credit determined under Section A-5.3. 
  A-5.2        ICP Eligibility SPP III Forfeiture.    A Participant who becomes entitled to receive payments under an income continuation plan or policy of an Affiliate on account of his or her Termination of Employment after attaining age 55 will forfeit that portion of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer Credit and Earnings Credit determined under Section A-5.3. 
  A-5.3        Amount of SPP III Forfeiture.    A Participant s forfeiture under Sections A-5.1 or A-5.2 is that portion of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credits attributable to his or her SPP Benefit determined under Section A-4.3 of Appendix A, and an amount of Earnings Credits equal to the investment adjustment that would have been credited on such SPP Benefit Transfer Credits at the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative through June 5, 2012 and for periods after June 5, 2012, at the Intermediate-Term Bond Crediting Rate Alternative. 
    41

Exhibit (10)S 

   DIP FACILITY TERM SHEET 
  Dated: January 14, 2015 
  WHEREAS  , Target Canada Co., a Nova Scotia unlimited company, has requested that the DIP Lender (as defined below) provide it funding in order to assist with certain restructuring  proceedings under the   Companies  Creditors Arrangement Act   (the    CCAA   ) to be commenced before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the    Court   ) involving itself and its subsidiaries in accordance with the terms set out herein; 
  NOW THEREFORE  , the parties, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual agreements contained herein (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged), agree as follows: 
                         DIP BORROWER 
    Target Canada Co. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the    Borrower   ) 
      DIP LENDER 
    Target Corporation (the    DIP Lender   ) 
    
      STATUS OF EXISTING FACILITY 
    Effective upon the date upon which the Borrower obtains the Initial Order under the CCAA (the    Filing Date   ), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees the amount owing to Nicollet Enterprise 1 S.  r.l. (the    Parent   ) pursuant to the Loan Facility Agreement dated as of May 18, 2011, between Borrower and Parent (f/k/a TSS S.  r.l.), as amended on March 28, 2014, on October 30, 2014 and on January 2, 2015 (as so amended, the    Existing Credit Agreement   ) is CDN $3,068,729,437.67 (together with fees, costs, expenses and other charges now or hereafter payable by the Borrower pursuant thereto), and is subject to the stay of proceedings contained in the Initial Order, but is owing without offset, right of compensation, defence or counterclaim of any nature, kind or description whatsoever.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower and Parent have entered into a Subordination and Postponement Agreement dated as of January 12, 2015 pursuant to which the claims and rights of the Parent under the Existing Credit Agreement may be subordinated to other Proven Claims in the CCAA proceeding, all as more fully set forth therein. 

-  2  - 

                          USE OF PROCEEDS AND PROJECTED CASH FLOWS 
    The Borrower has provided to the DIP Lender prior to the execution of this Term Sheet the cash flow projections (as the same may be amended from time to time as described below, the    Cash Flow Projections   ) set out in Schedule A reflecting the projected cash requirements of the Target Canada Group for the 13 week period commencing on the Filing Date calculated on a weekly basis.  The expenditures set out in the Cash Flow Projections may not be exceeded without the consent of the DIP Lender other than a cumulative variance in the actual  expenditures from the Filing Date forward in an aggregate amount less than 20% which variance has been approved by the Monitor and nonetheless still subject to the Maximum Amount (as defined below),  
        
    Every four weeks, the Borrower will provide the DIP Lender with an updated weekly budget of the following 13 week period in reasonably similar form to the Cash Flow Projections attached as Schedule A hereto (as updated, the    Updated Cash Flow Projections   ) describing the Borrower s updated cash flow requirements which shall be prepared by the Borrower in good faith and approved by the Monitor. Updated Cash Flow Projections which have been approved by the Monitor and do not project the DIP Facility exceeding the Maximum Amount then shall be the Cash Flow Projections for the purpose of this Term Sheet. 
        
    Advances under the DIP Facility (   DIP Advances   ) shall only be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its subsidiaries while under CCAA protection to pay those expenses contemplated by the Initial Order, any other Restructuring Court Order (as defined below) and in conformance with the Cash Flow Projections (the    Contemplated Expenses   ).  
        
    All material expenditures by the Borrower shall be consistent with Cash Flow Projections and shall be subject in each case to the overall limit on the availability of DIP Advances imposed by the Maximum Amount. 
        
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the proceeds of the DIP Advances may be used in connection with (a) any investigation (including discovery proceedings), initiation or prosecution of any claims, causes of action, motions, applications, actions, or other litigation against the DIP Lender, or (b) the initiation or prosecution of any claims, causes of action, motions, applications, actions, or other  

-  3  - 

litigation against the DIP Lender in such capacity in respect of this Term Sheet. 
    
      MAXIMUM AMOUNT 
    The maximum amount (   Maximum Amount   ) available under the credit facility (the    DIP Facility   ) will be USD $175,000,000. 
      MATURITY DATE 
    The earlier of (i) the date on which the stay of proceedings pursuant to the Initial Order, as amended from time to time, finally expires without being extended, (ii) the date on which the CCAA proceedings are terminated or (iii) January 15, 2016, or such later date as may be agreed to in writing by the DIP Lender, in its sole discretion (the    Maturity Date   ). 
        
    The commitment in respect of the DIP Facility shall expire on the Maturity Date and all amounts outstanding under the DIP Facility (the    Obligations   ) shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date without the DIP Lender being required to make demand upon the Borrower or to give notice that the DIP Facility has expired and the Obligations are due and payable, subject to the order of the Court.  
      DIP FACILITY 
    The DIP Facility will be a non-revolving term multi-draw credit facility up to the Maximum Amount, and will be available until the Maturity Date, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set out in this Term Sheet and the DIP Credit Documentation.  All DIP Advances shall be deposited into the Borrower s existing bank accounts at Bank of America (the    Borrower s Accounts   ) and withdrawn strictly to pay those Contemplated Expenses and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof and the Initial Order.  Each Borrower under the DIP Facility shall be jointly and severally liable for the amounts borrowed by any Borrower and interest thereon. 

-  4  - 

                          INTEREST RATE 
    The Borrower shall pay the DIP Lender interest (   Interest   ) on the principal outstanding amount of the DIP Advances and all other Obligations from time to time owing hereunder from the date of each DIP Advance or the date such other Obligation arises, as applicable, both before and after maturity, demand, default, or judgment and until actual payment in full, at the rate of 5% per annum payable on the Maturity Date; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing the rate shall automatically become 7% per annum until the Maturity Date. 
  All payments under or in respect of the DIP Facility shall be made free and clear of any withholding tax unless the Borrower is required to make such withholding under applicable law. If such withholding is required, any payments under the DIP Facility shall be made net of applicable withholding and there shall be no additional amounts payable by the Borrower in respect of withholding tax. 
        
    For the purpose of the   Interest Act   (Canada), the yearly rate of interest applicable to amounts owing under this note will be calculated on the basis of a 365 day year. 
        
    If any provision of this Term Sheet or the DIP Credit Documentation would obligate the Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to the DIP Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by the DIP Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as construed under the   Criminal Code   (Canada)), then notwithstanding that provision, that amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or result in a receipt by the DIP Lender of interest at a criminal rate. 
      DIP SECURITY 
    All Obligations of the Borrower under or in connection with the DIP Facility and any of the DIP Credit Documentation shall be secured by a Court Ordered Charge on all real and personal property now leased, owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower (the    DIP Lender s Charge   ) without need for any further loan or security documentation or filings in any personal property security registration regime or real property system. 

-  5  - 

                          MANDATORY REPAYMENTS 
    1. 
    Unless otherwise agreed by the DIP Lender, the Borrower shall make the following mandatory prepayments of the outstanding principal amount of the DIP Advances, if any, at the time of receipt of the net cash proceeds described below (subject in each case to payment or reserves for Court Ordered Charges, taxes and payment of Permitted Priority Liens): 

(a)     
    Prepayments in an amount equal to (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the incurrence of indebtedness by the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries which, for greater certainty, may only be incurred with the consent of the DIP Lender, and (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the receipt of any extraordinary income or receipts (including, without limitation, insurance proceeds (excluding business interruption, workers compensation or liability insurance), tax refunds and similar receipts outside of the ordinary course) by the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries; and 

(b) 
    Prepayments in an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds of any sale or other disposition (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) by the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries of any assets other than inventory   (whether such inventory is sold or disposed of through return to the vendor or wholesaler, the liquidation of the inventory by the Agent once appointed by the Court or otherwise). 

2. 
    All net cash proceeds payable to the DIP Lender from any of the events described above shall be applied, except as otherwise agreed to by the DIP Lender in writing, as follows: 

(a) 
    first, to pay accrued and unpaid Interest on the Obligations under the DIP Facility; 

(b) 
    second, to repay any principal amounts outstanding in respect of the DIP Facility; and 

(c) 
    third, the balance to be paid to the Borrower.

  AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE 
  NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT 
  (U.S. and Canada) 
    
  THIS NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ) is made in Minneapolis, Minnesota as of the date of grant (the  Grant Date ) set forth in the award letter (the  Award Letter ) by and between the Company and the person (the  Executive ) identified in the Award Letter.  This award of Options (collectively, may be referred to as the  Option ), provided to you as a Service Provider, is being issued under the Target Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), subject to the following terms and conditions. 
    
  1.      Definitions  .  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the defined terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  The term  Committee  shall also include those persons to whom authority has been delegated under the Plan.   
    
  2.      Grant of Option  .  Subject to the relevant terms of the Plan and this Agreement, as of the Grant Date, the Company has granted the Executive the number of Options set forth in the Award Letter. 
    
  3.      Purchase Price  .  The purchase price of each Share covered by the Option, which is 100% or more of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, shall be as set forth in the Award Letter.   
    
  4.      Exercise  .  Subject to Section 4(a), the Executive may exercise all or any part of the vested and previously unexercised portion of the Option at any time and from time to time until the Option expires, subject to the following provisions and subject to the terms of the Plan: 
    
  (a)      Shares Vested and Purchasable  .  The right to purchase 25% of the Shares subject to the Option shall vest on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and the right to purchase an additional 25% of the Shares subject to the Option shall vest on each succeeding anniversary of the Grant Date until the Option is 100% vested (on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date).  The unvested portion of the Option may not be exercised.  
    
  (b)      Exercisable Only by the Executive  .  Only (i) the Executive, (ii) the Executive s guardian or legal representative on behalf of the Executive, or (iii) the Executive s family member to the extent the Option or any part thereof is transferred to such family member pursuant to Section 7(b), may exercise the Option during the Executive s lifetime. 

(c)      Option Term  .  Except as provided in Section 4(d) or the Plan, the Option shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date. 
    
  (d)      Termination of Service  .  The Executive may exercise the Option after the Executive s termination of Service only as follows: 
    
  (i)      Early Retirement  . Subject to Section 4(f), if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 45 and prior to attaining age 60, the Executive has been providing Service for 15 years or more (which 15 years need not be continuous), and the Executive has been providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the Executive s date of termination, the Executive may exercise the vested portion of the Option within the applicable extension period or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier.  The applicable extension period shall be: (A) 2 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs prior to attaining age 48, (B) 3 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 48 and prior to attaining age 52, (C) 4 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 52 and prior to attaining age 55, and (D) 5 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 55.  The Option shall continue to vest pursuant to Section 4(a) during this post-termination exercise period. 
    
  (ii)      Normal Retirement  .  Subject to Section 4(f), if the Executive s termination of Service occurs at age 60 or older, the Executive has been providing Service for 10 years or more (which 10 years need not be continuous), and the Executive has been providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the Executive s date of termination, the Executive may exercise the vested portion of the Option within 10 years after the Grant Date.  The Option shall continue to vest pursuant to Section 4(a) during this post-termination exercise period. 
    
  (iii)      Disability  .  If the Executive s termination of Service occurs because of Disability, the Committee determines that the Executive is totally and permanently disabled as such term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A and the Executive has been providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the date of termination, then the Executive may exercise the vested portion of the Option (A) within 5 years after such termination of Service or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier, or (B) within 10 years after the Grant Date, if on or prior to such termination of Service, the Executive has satisfied the age and years of Service requirements of  Normal Retirement  in Section 4(d)(ii).  The Option shall continue to vest pursuant to Section 4(a) during the extended Option exercise period under this Section 4(d)(iii).  The Executive shall inform the Company or a Subsidiary to which the Executive is providing Service (the  Service Recipient ) of any change in the Executive s Disability status.  In the event the Executive ceases to be permanently and totally disabled in the judgment of the Committee, the Option shall terminate 90 days after notice is mailed by the Committee to the Executive stating that the Executive is no longer eligible for an extension under this Section 4(d)(iii), or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier.   
    
  (iv)  Death  .  In the event the Executive dies while a Service Provider and if the Executive was providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the Executive s date of death, the otherwise unvested portion of the Option shall become fully vested and 
    2  . 

exercisable on the Executive s date of death.  The Option may be exercised by the Executive s beneficiary as designated on the form prescribed by the Company (the  Designated Beneficiary ), or if none has been designated, the representative of the Executive s estate or the person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by will or the laws of descent and distribution, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, within 5 years from the Executive s date of death, or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier, provided that in either case the period for exercising the Option shall not be less than one year from the Executive s date of death.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if on or prior to the Executive s date of death, the Executive has satisfied the age and years of Service requirements of  Normal Retirement  in Section 4(d)(ii), the Option may be exercised within 10 years after the Grant Date, provided that the period for exercising the Option shall not be less than one year from the Executive s date of death.  In the event the Executive dies after termination of Service and prior to exercising all Shares under the Option, the Designated Beneficiary or the representative of the Executive s estate or the person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by will or the laws of descent and distribution may exercise the Option, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, but only to the extent vested on the Executive s date of death, and only within the time the Executive could have exercised the Option had the Executive survived, or one year from the Executive s date of death, whichever is later, but in no event later than 10 years after the Grant Date. 
    
  (v)  Cause  .  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Committee concludes, in its sole discretion, that the Executive s Service was terminated in whole or in part for Cause, the Option shall terminate immediately and the Executive shall have no rights hereunder.  
    
  (vi)      Other Termination  .  If the Executive s termination of Service occurs for any reason other than as specified in Sections 4(d)(i) through 4(d)(v) and the Executive has been continuously providing Service from the Grant Date to such date of termination, the Executive may exercise the Option within 90 days after such termination of Service (210 days if the Executive would be subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act on the date of termination), but only with respect to the portion of the Option that is vested at the time the Executive s Service terminates.  No additional vesting of the Option shall occur during this period. 
    
  (e)      Changes of Service  .  Service shall not be deemed terminated in the case of (i) any approved leave of absence, or (ii) transfers among the Company and any Subsidiaries in the same Service Provider capacity; however, a termination of Service shall occur if (x) the relationship the Executive had with the Company or a Subsidiary at the Grant Date terminates, even if the Executive continues in another Service Provider capacity with the Company or a Subsidiary, or (y) the Executive experiences a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A. 
    
  (f)      Conditions to Extension  .  As a condition to granting the post-termination extension periods described in Sections 4(d)(i) and 4(d)(ii), the Executive must enter into and not revoke a valid agreement with the Company containing a release of claims, a covenant not to engage in competitive employment and/or other provisions deemed appropriate by the  
    3  . 

Committee, in its sole discretion.

  5.      Manner of Exercise  .  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised by following the then-current procedures for exercise that are established by the Company; provided, however, that if the Executive is subject to taxation on any portion of his or her Service income in Canada, he or she may not exercise the Option using the stock swap method. 
    
  6.      Taxes  .  The Executive acknowledges that (a) the ultimate liability for any and all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ( Tax-Related Items ) legally due by him or her is and remains the Executive s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Service Recipient and (b) the Company and/or the Service Recipient or a former Service Recipient, as applicable, (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting and/or exercise of the Option; (ii) do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Executive s liability for Tax-Related Items; (iii) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction if the Executive has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event; and (iv) may refuse to honor the exercise or refuse to deliver the Shares to the Executive if he or she fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as provided in this Section. 
    
  The Executive authorizes and consents to the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, satisfying all applicable Tax-Related Items which the Company reasonably determines are legally payable by him or her by withholding from the Executive s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Executive by the Company and/or the Service Recipient.  In lieu thereof, the Executive may elect at the time of exercise such other then-permitted method or combination of methods established by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy the Executive s Tax-Related Items.  The Executive shall pay in cash to the Company or the Service Recipient any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Service Recipient reasonably determines may be required to withhold as a result of his or her participation in the Plan or his or her Option exercise that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. 
    
  7.      Limitations on Transfer  .

Subsequent transfers of a transferred Option shall be prohibited except for a re-transfer or re-assignment for no consideration by any of the persons or entities listed in 
    4  . 

clause (b) above back to the Executive.  Following transfer, this Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to the Option immediately before the transfer.  For purposes of any provision of this Agreement or the Plan relating to notice to the Executive or to acceleration or termination of the Option upon death or termination of Service of the Executive, the references to  Executive  shall mean the original grantee of the Option and not any transferee. 
    
  8.      Change in Control  .  In the event of a Change in Control, the extent to which the Option shall become vested and exercisable shall be determined pursuant to the Plan.

  (b)    require repayment of all or any portion of the amounts realized or received by the Executive resulting from the exercise of all or any portion of the Option or the sale of Shares related to the Option.   
    
  The term  restatement  shall mean the result of revising financial statements previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the correction of an error.

  10.      No Employment Rights  .  Nothing in this Agreement, the Plan or the Award Letter shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued Service with the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, nor shall it interfere with or limit in any way any right of the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, to terminate the Executive s Service at any time with or without Cause or change the Executive s compensation, other benefits, job responsibilities or title provided in compliance with applicable local laws and permitted under the terms of the Executive s Service contract, if any. 
    
  (a)    The Executive s rights to vest in or exercise the Option after termination of Service shall be determined pursuant to Sections 4(d) and 5.  Those rights and the Executive s

  (c)    in no event should the Option be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company or the Service Recipient, nor is the Option or the underlying Shares intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 
    
  (d)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;  
    
  (e)    if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value;

All remaining RSUs shall be cancelled and the Executive shall have no rights to such cancelled RSUs. 
    
  7.      Change in Control  .   
    
  (a)    If a Change in Control occurs prior to the Determination Date or after a Committee determination on the Determination Date that the Minimum Performance Condition has been satisfied, the Award will continue to be subject to the Vesting Schedule provided in Section 4 and the Minimum Performance Condition shall be deemed to be satisfied, except that if, after a Change in Control and prior to the end of the Performance Period: 
    
  (i)    the Executive s Service terminates voluntarily by the Executive for Good Reason (as defined in Section 11(b)(1)(y) of the Plan) or involuntarily without Cause, and provided that the Company has received a valid unrevoked Release Agreement from the Executive, then a number of unvested RSUs will immediately vest such that the total number of RSUs that vest and are converted to Shares under this Award equals the greater of (A) 50% of the total number of Shares subject to this Award, or (B) the total number of Shares subject to this Award multiplied by a fraction.  The numerator of such fraction referred to in this Section 7(a)(i)(B) shall be the number of months that have elapsed between the Grant Date and the date of termination of Service following the Change in Control, and the denominator shall be thirty-six (36) months.  Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 7(a)(i), the RSUs shall vest in full if, on or prior to the termination of Service under this Section 7(a)(i), the Executive satisfies the age and years of Service requirements of either the  Early Retirement Conditions  in Section 5(a) or the  Normal Retirement Conditions  in Section 5(b) and the Company has received a valid unrevoked Release Agreement from the Executive.

Service shall not be deemed terminated in the case of (a) any approved leave of absence, or (b) transfers among the Company and any Subsidiaries in the same Service Provider capacity; however, a termination of Service shall occur if (i) the relationship the Executive had with the Company or a Subsidiary at the Grant Date terminates, even if the Executive continues in another Service Provider capacity with the Company or a Subsidiary, or (ii) the Executive experiences a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A.

The Executive shall have the right to receive additional RSUs with a value equal to the regular cash dividend paid on one Share for each RSU held pursuant to this Agreement prior to the conversion of RSUs and issuance of Shares pursuant to Section 11.  The number of additional RSUs to be received as dividend equivalents for each RSU held shall be determined by dividing the cash dividend per share by the Fair Market Value of one Share on the dividend payment date; provided, however, that for purposes of avoiding the issuance of fractional RSUs, on each dividend payment date the additional RSUs issued as dividend equivalents shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.  All such additional RSUs received as dividend equivalents shall be subject to forfeiture in the same manner and to the same extent as the original RSUs granted hereby, and shall be converted into Shares on the basis and at the time set forth in Section 11 hereof. 
    
  11.      Conversion of RSUs and Issuance of Shares  . 
    
  (a)      Timing  .  Vested RSUs shall be converted to Shares and shall be issued within 90 days following the earliest to occur of (i) the third anniversary of the Grant Date, (ii) the Executive s  separation from service  as such term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A, (iii) the Executive s death, or (iv) the Executive s Disability (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, provided such determination complies with the definition of disability under Code Section 409A).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the events specified in subsections (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this Section 11(a) occur prior to the end of the Performance Period, then the vested RSUs shall be converted to Shares on a one-for-one basis and shall be issued within 90 days following completion of the Performance Period.   
    
  (b)      Limitation for Specified Employees  .  If any Shares shall be issuable with respect to the RSUs as a result of the Executive s  separation from service  at such time as the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then no Shares shall be issued, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, prior to the first business day after the earlier of (i) the date that is six months after the Executive s  separation from service , or (ii) the Executive s death.

  (d)      Code Section 409A  .  The Committee in its sole discretion may accelerate or delay the distribution of any payment under this Agreement to the extent allowed or required under Code Section 409A.  Payment of amounts under this Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and this Agreement shall in all respects be administered and construed to give effect to such intent. 
    
  12.      Taxes  .  The Executive acknowledges that (a) the ultimate liability for any and all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ( Tax-Related Items ) legally due by him or her is and remains the Executive s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Service Recipient and (b) the Company and/or the Service Recipient or a former Service Recipient, as applicable, (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting and/or conversion of the RSUs and issuance of Shares; (ii) do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Executive s liability for Tax-Related Items; (iii) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction if the Executive has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event; and (iv) may refuse to deliver the Shares to the Executive if he or she fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as provided in this Section. 
    
  The Executive authorizes and consents to the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, satisfying all applicable Tax-Related Items which the Company reasonably determines are legally payable by him or her by withholding from the Shares that would otherwise be delivered to the Executive the highest number of whole Shares that the Company determines has a value less than or equal to the aggregate applicable Tax-Related Items.  In lieu thereof, the Executive may elect at the time of conversion of the RSUs such other then-permitted method or combination of methods established by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy the Executive s Tax-Related Items. 
    
  13.      Limitations on Transfer  .  The Award shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged or encumbered by the Executive other than pursuant to the terms of the Plan.

  (a)    cancel all or a portion of the RSUs, whether vested or unvested, including any dividend equivalents related to the Award; and  
    5. 

(b)    require repayment of all or any portion of the amounts realized or received by the Executive resulting from the conversion of RSUs to Shares or the sale of Shares related to the Award.   
    
  The term  restatement  shall mean the result of revising financial statements previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the correction of an error.  The term  intentional misconduct  shall be limited to conduct that the Compensation Committee determines indicates intent to mislead management, the Board, or the Company s shareholders, but shall not include good faith errors in judgment made by the Executive.   
    
  The Executive agrees that the Company may setoff any amounts it is entitled to recover under this Section against any amounts owed by the Company to the Executive under any of the Company s deferred compensation plans to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A.  The Executive further agrees that the terms of this Section shall survive the Executive s termination of Service and any conversion of the Award into Shares.  This Section 14 shall not apply, and no amounts may be recovered hereunder, following a Change in Control. 
    
  15.      No Employment Rights  .  Nothing in this Agreement, the Plan or the Award Letter shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued Service with the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, nor shall it interfere with or limit in any way any right of the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, to terminate the Executive s Service at any time with or without Cause or change the Executive s compensation, other benefits, job responsibilities or title provided in compliance with applicable local laws and permitted under the terms of the Executive s Service contract, if any.

  (b)    This Agreement, the Plan and the Award Letter are separate from, and shall not form, any part of the contract of Service of the Executive, or affect any of the rights and obligations arising from the Service relationship between the Executive and the Company and/or the Service Recipient. 
    
  (c)    No Service Provider has a right to participate in the Plan.  All decisions with respect to future grants, if any, shall be at the sole discretion of the Company and/or the Service Recipient.

  THIS PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ) is made in Minneapolis, Minnesota as of the date of grant (the  Grant Date ) set forth in the award letter (the  Award Letter ) by and between the Company and the person (the  Executive ) identified in the Award Letter.  This award (the  Award ) of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units ( PBRSUs ), provided to you as a Service Provider, is being issued under the Target Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), subject to the following terms and conditions.  The intent of the Award is for the Executive to earn the Award, subject to minimum Company performance, for providing Service to the Company or a Subsidiary through the three full fiscal years after the Grant Date and, except for the specific circumstances described in this Agreement, receive the Shares issuable under the PBRSUs after the end of that period. 
    
  1.      Definitions  .  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the defined terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  The term  Committee  shall also include those persons to whom authority has been delegated under the Plan.

  (a)    Subject to the relevant terms of the Plan and this Agreement, as of the Grant Date, the Company has granted the Executive the number of PBRSUs set forth in the Award Letter (the  Goal Payout ).  The maximum number of Shares that may be earned is equal to 125% of the Goal Payout (the  Maximum Payout ).  The number of Shares actually earned, if any, shall depend on the Company s performance during the period comprised of the Company s three consecutive fiscal years beginning with the first full fiscal year commencing after the Grant Date (the  Performance Period ). 
    
  (b)    Except as set forth in Section 7, if the Minimum Performance Condition described in Section 3 is satisfied, the actual number of Shares earned will be determined by the Committee pursuant to a formula established by the Committee to measure the Company s performance during the Performance Period (the  Payout Formula ).  The determination of the actual number of Shares earned, which shall not exceed the Maximum Payout, shall occur as soon as practicable after completion of the Performance Period, but in any event not later than November 30 of the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends (the date the Committee so determines, the  Final Determination Date ).  A description of the Payout Formula and the percentage of Shares to be earned, if any, for the various levels of  

performance will be communicated to the Executive.  All decisions of the Committee regarding the application of the Payout Formula and the number of Shares earned shall be final and binding on the Executive.  Except as set forth in Section 7, the Award shall be cancelled and the Executive shall have no rights hereunder if any of the following occur: (i) the Committee determines on the Determination Date described in Section 3 that the Minimum Performance Condition has not been satisfied, or (ii) the Final Determination Date does not occur.

The Committee shall determine whether the Minimum Performance Condition is satisfied as soon as practicable after completion of the first full fiscal year of the Performance Period, but in any event not later than November 30 of the calendar year in which the first full fiscal year of the Performance Period ends (the date the Committee so determines, the  Determination Date ). 
    
  4.      Vesting Schedule  .  The PBRSUs shall vest on the earlier of:  (a) the end of the Performance Period, in which case, the PBRSUs shall vest in the amount determined by the Committee pursuant to the Payout Formula; (b) the date that the conditions for an Accelerated Vesting Event set forth in Section 5 are satisfied, in which case, the PBRSUs shall vest in the amount specified under the respective Accelerated Vesting Event; or (c) as specified in Sections 6 or 7.  The date of vesting is referred to as the  Vesting Date .

    3. 

(i)    the Executive s Service terminates voluntarily by the Executive for Good Reason (as defined in Section 11(b)(1)(y) of the Plan) or involuntarily without Cause, and provided that the Company has received a valid unrevoked Release Agreement from the Executive, then the total number of Shares earned under the Payout Formula shall be deemed to be equal to the greater of (A) 50% of the Goal Payout, or (B) the Goal Payout multiplied by a fraction.  The numerator of such fraction referred to in this Section 7(a)(i)(B) shall be the number of months that have elapsed between the Grant Date and the date of termination of Service following the Change in Control, and the denominator shall be thirty-six (36) months.

The numerator of such fraction shall be the number of months that have elapsed between the Grant Date and the date of termination of Service following the Change in Control, and the denominator shall be thirty-six (36) months.
