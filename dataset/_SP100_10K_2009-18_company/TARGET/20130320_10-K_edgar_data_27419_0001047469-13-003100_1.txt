PART I        

Item 1.    Business            

General   

  Target Corporation (the Corporation or Target) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1902. We operate as three reportable segments: U.S. Retail, U.S.
Credit Card and Canadian.   

  Our
U.S. Retail Segment includes all of our U.S. merchandising operations. We offer both everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated merchandise at discounted prices. Our ability to deliver a
shopping experience that is preferred by our customers, referred to as "guests," is supported by our strong supply chain and technology infrastructure, a devotion to innovation that is ingrained in
our organization and culture, and our disciplined approach to managing our current business and investing in future growth. Our business is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in
stores, online or through their mobile device.   

  Our
U.S. Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target Visa. Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary
Target Debit Card. Collectively, these REDcards  help strengthen the bond with our guests, drive incremental sales and contribute to our results of operations. In the first quarter of
2013, we sold our credit card receivables portfolio. Subsequent to the sale, we will perform account servicing and primary marketing functions, and will earn a substantial portion of the profits
generated by the portfolio. The transaction does not impact Target's 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program and will have minimal impact on Target's current cardholders and guests. Beginning with the
first quarter of 2013, income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized as an offset to selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses, and we
will no longer report a U.S. Credit Card Segment. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
for more information on our credit card receivables transaction.   

  Our
Canadian Segment includes costs incurred in the U.S. and Canada related to our 2013 Canadian retail market entry.   

Financial Highlights   

  Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years,
rather than to calendar years. Fiscal 2012 ended on February 2, 2013, and consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2011 ended January 28, 2012, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2010
ended January 29, 2011, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2013 will end on February 1, 2014, and will consist of 52 weeks.   

  For
information on key financial highlights and segment financial information, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data   Note 29, Segment Reporting, of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.   

Seasonality   

  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, a larger share of annual revenues and earnings traditionally occurs in the fourth quarter because it
includes the peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December.   

Merchandise   

  We sell a wide assortment of general merchandise and food in our stores. Our general merchandise and CityTarget stores offer a food assortment on a
smaller scale than traditional supermarkets, while our SuperTarget stores offer a   

  2  

Table of Contents   

  full
line of food items comparable to traditional supermarkets. Over the past several years, we remodeled many of our general merchandise stores to expand the food assortment to include perishables
and additional
dry grocery, dairy and frozen items. Our digital channels include a wide assortment of general merchandise, including many items found in our stores and a complementary assortment, such as extended
sizes and colors, that are only sold online.   

  A
significant portion of our sales is from national brand merchandise. Approximately one-third of total sales in 2012 related to our owned and exclusive brands, including but not limited
to the following:

Merchandise
is also sold through periodic exclusive design and creative partnerships. We also generate revenue from in-store amenities such as Target Caf , Target Clinic,
Target Pharmacy and Target Photo, and leased or licensed departments such as Target Optical, Pizza Hut, Portrait Studio and Starbucks.   

(a)     Includes pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning and paper products.      (b)     Includes electronics (including video game
hardware and software), music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods and toys.      (c)     Includes apparel for women, men, boys, girls, toddlers, infants and newborns, as well as
intimate apparel, jewelry, accessories and
shoes.      (d)     Includes dry grocery, dairy, frozen food, beverages, candy, snacks, deli, bakery, meat, produce and pet supplies.      (e)     Includes furniture, lighting, kitchenware, small appliances, home d cor, bed and bath, home improvement, automotive and
seasonal merchandise such as patio furniture and holiday d cor.    

Distribution   

  The vast majority of our merchandise is distributed through our network of 40 distribution centers, 37 in the United States and 3 in Canada. General
merchandise is shipped to and from
our distribution centers by common carriers. In addition, third parties distribute certain food items in the U.S. and Canada. Merchandise sold through Target.com is distributed through our own
distribution network, through third parties, or shipped directly from vendors.

Employees   

  At February 2, 2013, we employed approximately 361,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees, referred to as
"team members." During our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December, our employment levels peaked at approximately 409,000 team members. We offer a broad range of
company-paid benefits to our team members. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies, depending on team members' full-time or part-time status,
compensation level, date of hire and/or length of service. These company-paid benefits include a pension plan, 401(k) plan, medical and dental plans, a retiree medical plan, disability
insurance, paid vacation, tuition reimbursement, various team member assistance programs, life insurance and merchandise discounts. We consider our team member relations to be good.   

Working Capital   

  Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period from
Thanksgiving to the end of December. The increase in working capital during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and short-term borrowings. Additional
details are provided in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

  Effective
inventory management is key to our ongoing success. We utilize various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We achieve
effective inventory management by being in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel
items to minimize markdowns.   

Competition   

  We compete with traditional and off-price general merchandise retailers, apparel retailers, internet retailers, wholesale clubs, category
specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce. Our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely determines our competitive position
within the retail industry.   

Intellectual Property   

  Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, SuperTarget and our "Bullseye Design,"
have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection for our owned brands.   

Geographic Information   

  Through 2012, all of our revenues were generated within the United States. Beginning in fiscal 2013, a modest percentage of our revenues will be
generated in Canada. The vast majority of our long-lived assets are located within the United States and Canada.   

Available Information   

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K
and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge at www.Target.com/Investors as soon as reasonably
practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Business Conduct Guide, Corporate Responsibility
Report and the position descriptions for our Board of Directors and Board committees are also available free of charge in print upon request or at www.Target.com/Investors.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors            

  Our
business is subject to many risks. Set forth below are the most significant risks that we face.   

    If we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.     

The retail business is highly competitive. In the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests' shopping experience
by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, guest service, loyalty programs and marketing efforts. Guest perceptions
regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores, our in-stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our
competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margins and expenses.   

  We
sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands discussed on page 2. These brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers, generally
carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales. If one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence, our
sales and gross margins could be adversely affected.   

  The
continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers. In particular, consumers are able to
quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price. We have been working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise, and
encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our price match policy. Failure to effectively execute in these efforts, actions by our
competitors in response to these efforts or failure of our vendors to manage their own channels and content could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and, as a result,
have an adverse effect on sales, gross margins and expenses.   

    Our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Target which, if eroded, could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our
guests and team members.     

  We believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at Target and our team members choose Target as a place of employment is the reputation
we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies: guests, team members, the communities in which we operate and shareholders. To be successful in the future, we must continue
to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Target's reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. While reputations may take decades to build, even
isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Those types of incidents
could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including consumer boycotts, lost sales, loss of new store development opportunities, or team member
retention and recruiting difficulties.   

    If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable multichannel experience for our guests, our reputation and results of operations could be
adversely affected.     

  Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels (in-store, online,
mobile and social media, among others). Our guests are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all
aspects of our business. We currently provide full and mobile versions of our website (Target.com), applications for mobile phones and tablets and interact with our guests through social media.
Multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations, and new developments and technology investments by our competitors. If we are unable to attract and
retain team members or contract with third parties having the   

  5  

Table of Contents   

  specialized
skills needed to support our multichannel efforts, implement improvements to our guest-facing technology in a timely manner, or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our
guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if Target.com and our other guest-facing technology
systems do not reliably function as designed,
we may experience a loss of guest confidence, data security breaches, lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which, if significant, could adversely affect our reputation and results of
operations.   

    If we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margins and profitability could suffer.     

  A substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend-right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of
merchandise categories, including apparel, home d cor, seasonal offerings, food and other merchandise. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences,
spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales, spoilage and increased inventory markdowns, which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our
sales, gross margins and profitability.   

    Our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States.     

  Most of our stores and all of our digital sales are in the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the
health of the U.S. economy. In addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Illinois, resulting in
further dependence on local economic conditions in these states. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence and guest financial situations could negatively affect our business in
many ways, including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales, and reducing gross margins. These same considerations impact the success of our credit card program. Even though we no longer
own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with TD Bank Group (TD). Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could
adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. These conditions could result in us
receiving lower profit-sharing payments.   

    If we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce, our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected.     

  With approximately 361,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our ability to
attract, train and retain qualified team members. Many of those team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our labor
needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, collective bargaining efforts, health care and other benefit costs and changing
demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, guest service levels and support functions could suffer. Those
factors, together with increasing wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations. As of March 20, 2013, none of our team members were working under collective
bargaining agreements. We are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts. If we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could adversely affect our labor
costs and how we operate our business.   

    Lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth, and difficulty in executing plans for new stores, expansions and remodels
could increase our costs and capital requirements.     

  Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves
appropriate returns on our capital investment. We compete with other retailers and   

  6  

Table of Contents   

  businesses
for suitable locations for our stores. In addition, for many sites we are dependent on a third party developer's ability to acquire land, obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning
changes and permits for a larger project, of which our store may be one component. Turmoil in the financial markets may make it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new
projects. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing,
expanding and remodeling our stores. A significant portion of our expected new store sites is located in fully developed markets, which is generally a more time-consuming and expensive
undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets.   

    Interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity prices and supply chain costs could adversely affect our gross margins, expenses and results of operations.     

We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due
to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales. In addition, a large portion of our merchandise is
sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, the outbreak of pandemics, labor
unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could
disrupt our supply of merchandise and/or adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our
supply chain, including labor,
fuel, tariffs, and currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on gross margins, expenses and results of operations.   

    Failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.     

  If our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children's products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests' expectations
regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are
dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food or drug
contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative guest perceptions regarding the
safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the
confidence of our guests.   

    If our efforts to protect the security of personal information about our guests and team members are unsuccessful, we could be subject to costly government enforcement
actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer.     

  The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests and team members. We have a program in place to
detect and respond to data security incidents. To date, all incidents we have experienced have been insignificant. If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and
appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our guests could lose confidence in our ability
to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue usage of REDcards, decline to use our pharmacy services, or stop shopping with us altogether. The loss of confidence from a
significant data security breach involving team members could hurt our reputation, cause team member recruiting and retention challenges, increase our labor costs and affect how we operate our
business.

    Our failure to comply with federal, state or local laws, or changes in these laws could increase our costs, reduce our margins and lower our sales.     

  Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce
could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer's obligation to
recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition, changes in the
regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit, Medicare reimbursements, privacy and information security, product safety, supply chain transparency or environmental
protection, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws
and regulations, particularly wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results
of operations by increasing our costs, reducing our margins and lowering our sales.   

    Weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns, which alone or together with natural disasters, particularly in areas where our sales
are concentrated, could adversely affect our results of operations.     

  Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns, particularly in apparel and seasonal items, which could
lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short-term results of operations. In addition, our three largest states, by total sales, are California,
Texas and Florida, areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are more prevalent. Natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical
damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores, which could
adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales.   

    Changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.     

  Our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors, including changes in tax law, tax treaties, interpretation of existing laws, and
our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination. Changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our profitability and results of
operations. In addition, the expansion of our retail store operations outside of the United States may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.   

    If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our financial position, growth plans, liquidity and results of operations could suffer.     

  We are dependent on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans. In particular, we
have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund
seasonal needs for working capital. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong
debt ratings. If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit
rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same. In addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure
to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working
capital needs, and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

    A significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations.     

  We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process guest transactions, service REDcard accounts and summarize and analyze
results. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our
systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage
inventories or process guest transactions, and encounter a loss of guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    If we do not effectively execute our plan to expand retail store operations into Canada, our financial results could be adversely affected.     

  Our 2013 entry into the Canadian retail market is our first retail store expansion outside of the United States. Our ability to successfully open the
expected number of Canadian Target stores on schedule depends, in large measure, upon our ability to remodel existing assets, build our supply chain
capabilities and technology systems and recruit, hire and retain qualified team members. In addition, our ability to offer the expected assortment of merchandise in certain markets may be impacted by
the availability of local vendors of certain types of goods. The effective execution of our Canadian retail store expansion is also contingent on our ability to design new marketing programs that
positively differentiate us from other retailers in Canada, and achieve market acceptance by Canadian guests. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plan in Canada, our financial performance
could be adversely affected.   

    A disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations.     

We rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions, including our Canadian supply chain, portions of our technology systems,
multichannel platforms and distribution network, and extensions of credit for our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program. If we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills
needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business, or if those third parties fail to meet our performance standards and expectations, our reputation, sales
and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services
in-house.

PART II        

Item 5.    Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities            

  Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TGT." We are authorized to issue up to
6,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0833, and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01. At March 15, 2013, there were 16,412 shareholders of record. Dividends
declared per share and the high and low closing common stock price for each fiscal quarter during 2012 and 2011 are disclosed in Note 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   

  During
the first quarter of 2012, we completed a $10 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In January 2012, our Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of an additional $5 billion of our common stock, with no stated expiration for the share repurchase program. Since the inception of the $5 billion share repurchase program
and through the end of 2012, we have repurchased 27.3 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $1,621 million ($59.44 average price per share).   

The
table below presents information with respect to Target common stock purchases made during the three months ended February 2, 2013 by Target or any "affiliated purchaser" of Target, as
defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act.   

(a)     The table above includes shares reacquired upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. For the three months ended February 2, 2013, no shares were
reacquired through these contracts. At February 2, 2013, we held asset positions in prepaid forward contracts for 1.2 million shares of our common stock, for a total cash investment of
$54 million, or an average per share price of $45.46. Refer to Notes 25 and 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for further details of these contracts.      (b)     The number of shares above includes shares of common stock reacquired from team members who tendered owned shares to
satisfy the tax
withholding on equity awards as part of our long-term incentive plans or to satisfy the exercise price on stock option exercises. For the three months ended February 2, 2013, 91,565
shares were reacquired at an average per share price of $60.73 pursuant to our long-term incentive plan.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations            

Executive Summary     

  Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. The 2012 period includes 53 weeks, while 2011 and 2010 each consisted of
52 weeks.   

  Consolidated
revenues were $73,301 million for 2012, an increase of $3,436 million or 4.9 percent from the prior year. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income
taxes for 2012 increased by $49 million or 0.9 percent over 2011 to $5,371 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,325 million, $5,434 million and
$5,271 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in 2012 increased 5.6 percent to $4.52 from $4.28 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share,
which we believe is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our U.S. operations, increased 7.9 percent to $4.76 in 2012 from $4.41 in the
prior year.   

Note:    A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on
page 22.   

(a)     Consisted of 53 weeks.      (b)     Adjustments represent the diluted EPS impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, the gain on
receivables held for sale, favorable
resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt.    

Our 2012 financial results in our U.S. Retail Segment reflect increased sales of 5.1 percent over the same period last year due to a 2.7 percent
comparable-store increase, the contribution from new stores and the additional week in 2012. Our 2012 U.S. Retail Segment earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) margin rate decreased slightly from the prior period, primarily due to a lower gross margin rate from our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program. Our earnings before
interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) margin rate remained consistent with the prior year due to a decrease in our depreciation and amortization rate.   

  14  

Table of Contents   

  In
the U.S. Credit Card Segment, we experienced a decrease in segment profit due to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year and lower finance charge revenue resulting from a
smaller portfolio. These changes were partially offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of $2,769 million in collateralized debt in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the
additional week in 2012.   

  The
2012 and 2011 loss in our Canadian Segment totaling $369 million and $122 million, respectively, is comprised of start-up costs and depreciation related to our 2013 entry
into the Canadian retail market.   

Credit Card Receivables Transaction   

  On October 22, 2012, we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD). Historically, our
credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. With this agreement, our receivables are classified as held for sale at February 2, 2013, and are
recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value. We recorded a gain of $161 million outside of our segments in 2012, representing the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful
accounts and record our receivables at lower of cost (par) or fair value.   

  On
March 13, 2013, we completed the sale to TD for cash consideration of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Concurrent
with the sale of the portfolio for $5.7 billion, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of
$1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash
proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt. Over time, we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment-grade credit ratings by
further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program.   

  Following
this sale, TD will underwrite, fund and own Target Credit Card and Target Visa receivables in the U.S. TD will control risk management policies and oversee regulatory compliance, and we will
perform account servicing and primary marketing functions. We will earn a substantial portion of the profits generated
by the Target Credit Card and Target Visa portfolios. This transaction will be accounted for as a sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported on our Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position.   

  In
the first quarter of 2013, we will recognize a gain on sale of $391 million related to consideration received in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables. Consideration received
includes cash of $5.7 billion and a beneficial interest asset of $225 million. The beneficial interest effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit-sharing
we expect to receive on the receivables sold. Based on historical payment patterns, we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a four year period, with larger reductions in
the early years. As a result, a portion of the profit-sharing payments we receive from TD in the first four years of the arrangement will not be recorded as income on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.   

  Following
the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013, income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized within SG A expenses. Including the
profit-sharing arrangement in the U.S. Segment will reduce the SG A rate below the historical U.S. Retail Segment SG A rate, and raise EBITDA and EBIT margin rates above historical U.S. Retail Segment
rates.   

  For
comparison purposes, historical U.S. Retail Segment and U.S. Credit Card Segment results will be restated to form a new U.S. Segment. The combination of these two historical segments into a
single U.S. Segment will result in a higher SG A rate in 2013 compared with 2012, 2011 and 2010, reflecting credit card profit that will be retained by TD beginning in 2013.   

Although
we expect lower EBITDA and EBIT margin rates in the U.S. Segment compared with prior periods, we expect that the impact of the receivables sale transaction will become neutral and ultimately
accretive to EPS over time.

Analysis of Results of Operations   

    U.S. Retail Segment     

Note:    See Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment
results to earnings before income taxes.   

(a)     Consisted of 53 weeks.      (b)     Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we
changed the formula under which the U.S.
Retail Segment charges the U.S. Credit Card Segment to better align with the attributes of this program. Loyalty program charges were $300 million, $258 million and $102 million
in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In all periods, these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG A expenses within the U.S. Retail Segment and increases to operations and marketing
expenses within the U.S. Credit Card Segment.    

Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales.   

(a)     Consisted of 53 weeks.    

Sales     

  Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Sales growth in 2012 and 2011 resulted from higher comparable-store sales and the contribution from new stores, with 2012 also benefitting by
1.7 percentage points from the additional week. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.   

  Refer
to the Merchandise section in Item 1, Business, for additional product category information.   

  Comparable-store
sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year
period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to
similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. Comparable-store sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than thirteen months.   

16  

Table of Contents   

  The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new
stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.   

  Credit
is offered to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target Visa (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary
Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards . Since October 2010, guests receive a 5-percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout, every
day, when they use a REDcard. In November 2011, guests also began to receive free shipping at Target.com when they use their REDcard.   

  We
monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on
our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder representing a shift in tender type.   

Gross Margin Rate     

  Our gross margin rate was 29.7 percent in 2012, 30.1 percent in 2011 and 30.5 percent in 2010. The decrease in each period
reflects the impact of our integrated growth strategies of our 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program, which impacted the rate by 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent in
2012 and 2011, respectively, partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories in 2011. The REDcard Rewards loyalty program reduces gross margin rates because it drives incremental
sales among guests who receive a 5-percent discount on virtually all items purchased. The remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a
stronger-than-average mix in lower-than-average gross margin rate product categories, primarily food.   

  We
changed certain merchandise vendor contracts beginning in 2013. As a result, we expect our gross margin rate to increase by about 20 to 25 basis points from prior years, with an equal and
offsetting increase in our SG A rate. This shift will result from a larger proportion of vendor income offsetting cost of sales as compared to certain advertising expenses within SG A. This change
will have no impact on our EBITDA or EBIT margins or margin rates as our SG A rate will increase by the same amount.   

In
January 2013 we announced plans to price match top online retailers year-round. Based on our experience during the 2012 holiday season, we do not expect this change to significantly
affect our gross margin rate.   

    Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate     

  Our SG A expense rate was 19.9 percent, 20.1 percent and 20.3 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in 2012
was primarily due to improvements in store hourly payroll expense, which impacted the rate by 0.1 percent, and continued disciplined expense management across the Company, partially offset by
technology and multichannel investments, which impacted the rate by nearly 0.2 percent. The change in 2011 was primarily due to increased loyalty program charges to the U.S. Credit Segment and
favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense.   

  As
noted above, a 2013 change to certain merchandise vendor contracts is expected to increase our SG A rate by about 20 to 25 basis points because vendor funding will no longer offset certain
advertising expenses. This change will have no impact on our EBITDA or EBIT margins or margin rates as our gross margin rate will increase by the same amount.   

Following
the sale of our credit card portfolio in 2013, income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized as an offset to SG A expenses.

    Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate     

  Our depreciation and amortization expense rate was 2.8 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The decrease in 2012 was due to the favorable impact of higher sales combined with stable depreciation and amortization expenses, reflecting the moderate pace of capital investments in
recent years, and the impact from the additional week in 2012.

    U.S. Credit Card Segment     

  Credit is offered to qualified guests through the Target Credit Cards, which support our core retail operations and are important contributors to our
overall profitability and engagement with our guests. Credit card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, which are amounts received from
merchants who accept the Target Visa.

earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.      (d)     As a percentage
of average credit card receivables, at par. For 2012, the additional week has been adjusted to provide comparable results
to the prior period.    

Our primary measure of segment profit is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt
collateralized by credit card receivables. We also measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This
metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost
applied to the entire portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR. We   

  19  

Table of Contents   

  continue
to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our U.S. Credit Card Segment, which allows us to evaluate the performance of the portfolio. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is eliminated in consolidation to present the receivables at the lower of cost (par) or fair value. On a consolidated basis, net write-offs are reported within credit
card expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

  In
2012 and 2011, segment revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower average receivables resulting in reduced finance charge revenue. In 2012, segment expense increases were driven
by higher bad debt expense, primarily attributable to annualizing over a significant reserve reduction in the prior year. In 2011, segment expenses decreased from the prior year as we significantly
reduced our bad debt reserve due to improved trends in key measures of risk. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined in both 2012 and 2011 due to lower outstanding nonrecourse debt
securitized by credit card receivables.   

(a)     Write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges), and recoveries include
current period principal collections on previously written-off balances. These amounts combined represent net write-offs.    

Period-end and average credit card receivables, at par, have declined because of an increase in payment rates and a decrease in Target Visa charges
at third-parties, partially offset by an increase in charges at Target over the past two years. The decrease in charges at third parties is primarily due to the fact that we no longer issue new Target
Visa accounts.   

    Canadian Segment     

  During 2012 and 2011, start-up costs reported in SG A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled $272 million
and $74 million, respectively, and primarily consisted of compensation, benefits and third-party

  service
expenses. Additionally, we recorded $97 million and $48 million in depreciation for 2012 and 2011, respectively.   

    Other Performance Factors     

    Net Interest Expense     

  Net interest expense was $762 million in 2012, including $78 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases. This decrease of
12.0 percent, or $104 million, from 2011 was primarily due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2011. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers
to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt, which will impact interest expense in 2013.   

  Net
interest expense was $866 million for 2011, increasing 14.4 percent, or $109 million from 2010. This increase was due to an $87 million loss on early retirement of
debt, $44 million of interest on Canadian capitalized leases and higher average debt balances, partially offset by a lower average portfolio interest rate.   

    Provision for Income Taxes     

  Our effective income tax rate increased to 34.9 percent in 2012, from 34.3 percent in 2011, primarily due to a reduction in the
favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada, which are tax effected at a lower rate than U.S. earnings. Various income tax matters were resolved
in 2012 and 2011 which reduced tax expense by $58 million and $85 million, respectively. A tax rate reconciliation is provided in Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   

  Our
effective income tax rate decreased to 34.3 percent in 2011, from 35.1 percent in 2010, primarily due to a reduction in the structural domestic effective tax rate. This reduction was
slightly offset by a reduction in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the unfavorable impact of losses in Canada, which are tax effected at a lower rate than U.S. earnings.
Various income tax matters were resolved in 2011 and 2010 which reduced tax expense by $85 million and $102 million, respectively.   

  We
expect a 2013 consolidated effective income tax rate of 35.7 percent to 36.7 percent, excluding the impact of resolution of income tax matters.

    Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures     

  Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions. To provide additional
transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of our 2013 Canadian market entry, the gain on receivables held for sale, favorable
resolution of various income tax matters and the loss on early retirement of debt. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the
results of our U.S. operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is
diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP adjusted EPS
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS differently than we do,
limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.   

Note:  A non-GAAP financial measures summary is provided on page 14. The sum of the
non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding.   

(a)     Consisted of 53 weeks.      (b)     Represents interest expense, net of interest income, not included in U.S. Credit Card Segment
profit. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, U.S.
Credit Card Segment profit included $13 million, $72 million and $83 million of interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables, respectively. These
amounts, along with other net interest expense, equal consolidated GAAP net interest expense.      (c)     Represents the gain on receivables held for sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations, plus the difference between U.S.
Credit Card Segment bad debt expense and net write-offs for the fourth quarter of 2012.      (d)     Taxes are allocated to our business segments based on income tax rates applicable to the
operations of the segment for the period.      (e)     For 2012, 2011 and 2010, average diluted shares outstanding were 663.3 million, 683.9 million and 729.4 million,
respectively.      (f)     Represents the effect of resolution of income tax matters. The 2012 results also include a $55 million tax expense for the
adjustment related to receivables held for sale, while the 2011 results include a $32 million tax benefit related to the loss on early retirement of debt.      (g)     Represents the loss on
early retirement of debt.

Analysis of Financial Condition   

    Liquidity and Capital Resources     

Our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was $784 million compared with $794 million in 2011.
Short-term investments (highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase) of $130 million and $194 million were included
in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy
allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain dollar limits on our
investments in individual funds or instruments.   

    Cash Flows     

  Our 2012 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,325 million in 2012
compared with $5,434 million in 2011. During 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured debt that matures in July 2042, and we amended the 2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate to
obtain additional funding of $500 million and to extend the maturity to 2013. These cash flows, combined with our prior year-end cash position, allowed us to fund capital
expenditures, pay current maturities, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share repurchase program.   

  Our
2012 period-end credit card receivables, at par, were $6,024 million compared with $6,357 million in 2011, a decrease of 5.2 percent. Average credit card
receivables, at par, in 2012 decreased 5.1 percent compared with 2011 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the U.S. Credit Card Segment above. As of February 2,
2013, $1,500 million of our credit card receivables portfolio was funded by third parties.   

  On
October 22, 2012, we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD). On March 13, 2013, we completed the sale to TD for cash
consideration of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Concurrent with the sale of the portfolio, we repaid the nonrecourse debt
collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of $1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. As of March 20,
2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt. Over time, we expect to apply the remaining
proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment-grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program.   

  Year-end
inventory levels decreased slightly from $7,918 million in 2011 to $7,903 million in 2012, primarily due to supply chain management improvements and continued
disciplined inventory management, partially offset by an increase in inventory for our 2013 Canadian retail market entry. Accounts payable increased by $199 million, or 2.9 percent over
the same period.   

    Share Repurchases     

  During the first quarter of 2012, we completed a $10 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007,
and began repurchasing shares under a new $5 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2012. During 2012, we repurchased 32.2 million shares of our common stock for
a total investment of $1,900 million ($58.96 per share). During 2011, we repurchased 37.2 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,894 million ($50.89 per
share).   

    Dividends     

  We paid dividends totaling $869 million in 2012 and $750 million in 2011, for an increase of 15.9 percent. We declared dividends
totaling $903 million ($1.38 per share) in 2012, for an increase of 16.2 percent over 2011. We declared dividends totaling $777 million ($1.15 per share) in 2011, an increase of
17.8 percent over 2010. We have   

  23  

Table of Contents   

  paid
dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.   

Short-term and Long-term Financing     

  Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to
maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt, commercial paper and
securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our
operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. As of February 2, 2013, our credit ratings were as follows:   

Credit Ratings    

Standard and Poor's   

Moody's   
     
  Fitch   

Long-term debt  

A2  

A+  

A-  

Commercial paper  

P-1  

A-1  

F2  

If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely
impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above.   

  As
a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include interest expense
and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio was 6.1x in 2012, 5.9x in 2011 and 6.1x in 2010.   

  In
2012, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds. In 2011, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program
and used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued.   

We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility obtained in October 2011 and expiring in October 2017. No
balances were outstanding at any time during 2012 or 2011 under this facility.   

  Most
of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. Our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in
compliance with these covenants, and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, at February 2, 2013, no notes or debentures contained provisions
requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we
experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our
long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.   

  We
believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, pay dividends and continue purchases under our share
repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.

    Capital Expenditures     

(a)     See Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures by segment.    

The decrease in capital expenditures in 2012 from the prior year was primarily driven by the purchase of Zellers leases in Canada in 2011 and fewer store
remodels in the U.S. in 2012, partially offset by continued investment in new stores in the U.S. and Canada and technology and multichannel investments. We expect approximately $3.8 billion of
capital expenditures in 2013, reflecting an estimated $2.3 billion in our U.S. Segment and approximately $1.5 billion in our Canadian Segment.   

    Commitments and Contingencies     

(a)     Represents principal payments only, and excludes any fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt under
derivative and hedge accounting rules. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.      (b)     Total contractual lease payments include
$3,323 million and $2,039 million of capital and operating lease payments,
respectively, related to options to extend the lease term that are reasonably assured of being exercised. These payments also include $947 million and $181 million of legally binding
minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2013 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. Capital lease obligations include interest. See Note 22 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.      (c)     Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and
facilities.      (d)     Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred
compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.    
  25  

Table of Contents    

(e)     Estimated tax contingencies of $280 million, including interest and penalties, are not
included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.      (f)     Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.      (g)
     Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise
royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which
represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we
choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of
business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.      (h)     We have not included obligations under our pension and
postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table
above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of February 2, 2013. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum
pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.    

    Off Balance Sheet Arrangements:       Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are
not consolidated into the financial statements.   

    Critical Accounting Estimates     

  Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are
drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not
believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical
accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:   

    Inventory and cost of sales:       We use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method,
inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's
ending retail value. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution
centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed in the
period incurred. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses
related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown
our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic
conditions change, including changing consumer
demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months.
Inventory was $7,903 million and $7,918 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively, and is further described in Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents   

    Vendor income receivable:       Cost of sales and SG A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is
earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable
for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is
earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the
assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $621 million and
$592 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Credit card receivables accounting:       Historically, our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. When receivables
were recorded, we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write-offs. The allowance included provisions for uncollectible finance charges and
other credit-related fees. We estimated future write-offs based on historical experience of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Accounts were automatically
written off when they became 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts was appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable;
however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could have materially changed these expectations.   

As
of February 2, 2013, our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value because they are classified as held for sale as a result of the credit card
receivables transaction. Lower of cost (par) or fair value is determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and credit-quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance
for doubtful accounts. Many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost (par) because fair value exceeds cost. Delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value, which reflects our expectation
of losses on these receivables. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our credit card receivables.   

Long-lived assets:       Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying
amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair value of
assets we intend to sell or close as of February 2, 2013 would result in additional impairment of $4 million in 2012. Historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of
long-lived assets.   

    Insurance/self-insurance:       We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and
team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of
both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers'
compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was
$627 million and $646 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be
significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our
self-insurance expense by $31 million in 2012. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the market risks
associated with these exposures.

Table of Contents   

    Income taxes:       We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax
positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess these
probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $280 million and
$318 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Pension and postretirement health care accounting:       We maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded
nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions
described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of
service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the
discount rate and compensation growth rates. The assumptions used to determine the period-end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year, with adjustments made for any
significant plan or participant changes.   

  Our
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current
market conditions. Our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 5.7 percent, 10.0 percent, 7.8 percent and 9.5 percent for the 5-year,
10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual
expense by $27 million.   

  The
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities
that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the
weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $28 million.   

  Based
on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older,
longer-service pension-eligible team members.   

  Pension
and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Legal contingencies:       We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a
manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our
consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an
unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods.   

New Accounting Pronouncements   

  We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.

Forward-Looking Statements   

  This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically
accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: For our U.S.
Credit Card Segment, aggregate portfolio risks; for our Canadian Segment, the timing and amount of future capital investments in Canada and our subsequent financial performance; on a consolidated
basis, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the fair value of our consumer credit card receivables, the pending sale of these receivables and
related gain, including beneficial interest, the application of proceeds from the sale and the impact on our future results of operations, earnings and rates, the continued execution of our share
repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures, the expected effective income tax rate, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our
intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the impact of future changes
in foreign currency exchange rates, the expected changes in gross margin and SG A rates, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers'
compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of claims and litigation, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities, including foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, and the resolution of tax matters.   

  All
such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as
amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual
results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in conjunction with
the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of
the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.    

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk            

  At February 2, 2013, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of
which are at a LIBOR-plus floating-rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime-based floating-rate.
Historically, to manage our net interest margin, we generally maintained levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues
fluctuated. The degree of floating asset and liability matching varied over time and in different interest rate environments. At February 2, 2013, the amount of floating-rate credit
card assets exceeded the amount of net floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $1 billion. See further description of our debt and derivative instruments in Notes 20
and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the sale of our consumer credit card portfolio, funding risk was transferred to TD Bank Group. Following the sale, our
interest rate exposure will primarily be due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligations differ from our floating rate short term investments. In general, we expect our floating rate
debt to exceed our floating rate short term investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments.   

  We
record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in certain interest
rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate
changes. Based on our balance sheet position at February 2, 2013, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income
taxes by $9 million.   

  In
addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase
annual expense by $28 million. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect against   

  29  

Table of Contents   

  declines
in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged
36 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.   

  As
more fully described in Note 15 and Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our
nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own
common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified
defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.   

  We
are exposed to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We will be further exposed to this risk as we commence Canadian operations during 2013. During 2012 and 2011,
gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant as all stores were located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise was purchased in U.S.
dollars.   

  There
have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.

    Report of Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements     

  Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity and presentation of the information in the Annual Report. The consolidated financial
statements and other information presented in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include necessary judgments and
estimates by management.   

  To
fulfill our responsibility, we maintain comprehensive systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance
with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of internal
control provide this reasonable assurance.   

  The
Board of Directors exercised its oversight role with respect to the Corporation's systems of internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent directors.
The Committee oversees the Corporation's systems of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and audits to assess whether their quality, integrity and objectivity are sufficient to
protect shareholders' investments.   

  In
addition, our consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, whose report also appears on this page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements     

   The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of February 2, 2013 and
January 28, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended
February 2, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.   

  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

  In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries at February 2,
2013 and January 28, 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 2, 2013, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.   

  We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of
February 2, 2013, based on criteria established in    Internal Control Integrated Framework    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 20, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on the framework in    Internal Control Integrated
Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we conclude that the Corporation's internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.   

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who has also audited
our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report which appears on this page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

  We have audited Target Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on criteria established in     Internal Control Integrated
Framework    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The
Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.   

  We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

  Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   

  In
our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.   

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and
subsidiaries as of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders' investment for each of
the three years in the period ended February 2, 2013, and our report dated March 20, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     

1. Summary of Accounting Policies     

    Organization       Target Corporation (Target, the Corporation, or the Company) operates three reportable segments: U.S. Retail, U.S. Credit Card and Canadian. Our U.S.
Retail Segment includes all of our U.S. merchandising operations. Our U.S. Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards: the Target Credit Card
and the Target Visa (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards , which strengthen the bond
with our guests, drive incremental sales and contribute to our profitability. Our Canadian Segment was initially reported in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of our purchase of leasehold
interests in Canada from Zellers, Inc. (Zellers). This segment includes costs incurred in the U.S. and Canada related to our 2013 Canadian retail market entry.   

    Consolidation       The consolidated financial statements include the balances of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and
transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of those entities'
operations, including a bankruptcy remote subsidiary through which we sell certain accounts receivable as a method of providing funding for our accounts receivable.   

Use of estimates       The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.   

    Fiscal year       Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years,
rather than to calendar years. Fiscal 2012 ended February 2, 2013 and consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2011 ended January 28, 2012, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2010
ended January 29, 2011, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2013 will end February 1, 2014, and will consist of 52 weeks.   

    Accounting policies       Our accounting policies are disclosed in the applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   

2. Revenues     

  Our retail stores generally record revenue at the point of sale. Sales from our online and mobile applications include shipping revenue and are
recorded upon delivery to the guest. Total revenues do not include sales tax because we are a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return
merchandise within 90 days of purchase. Revenues are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns as a percentage of sales. Commissions earned on sales
generated by leased departments are included within sales and were $25 million, $22 million and $20 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

  Revenue
from gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption. Our gift cards do not have expiration dates. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable percentage of
gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was not material in any period
presented.   

  Credit
card revenues are recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement. When accounts are written off, uncollected finance charges and late fees are recorded as a
reduction of credit card revenues. Target retail sales charged on our credit cards totaled $5,807 million, $4,686 million and $3,455 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

38  

Table of Contents   

  Since
October 2010, guests receive a 5-percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard. In November 2011, guests also began to receive free
shipping at Target.com when they use their REDcard. The discounts associated with loyalty programs are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were
$583 million, $340 million and $162 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

3. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     

  The following table illustrates the primary costs classified in each major expense category:   

Cost of Sales    
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    

Total cost of products sold including 
    Freight expenses associated with moving 
    merchandise from our vendors to our 
    distribution centers and our retail stores, and 
    among our distribution and retail facilities 
    Vendor income that is not reimbursement of 
    specific, incremental and identifiable costs 
Inventory shrink 
Markdowns 
Outbound shipping and handling expenses 
    associated with sales to our guests 
Payment term cash discounts 
Distribution center costs, including compensation 
    and benefits costs 
Import cost 

Compensation and benefit costs including 
    Stores 
    Headquarters 
Occupancy and operating costs of retail and 
    headquarters facilities 
Advertising, offset by vendor income that is a 
    reimbursement of specific, incremental and 
    identifiable costs 
Pre-opening costs of stores and other facilities 
Other administrative costs  

Note:    The
classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.    

4. Consideration Received from Vendors     

  We receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising
allowances and for our compliance programs, referred to as "vendor income." Vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or SG A expenses based on the provisions of the arrangement. Promotional
and advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores. Under our compliance programs, vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not
meet our requirements (violations), such as late or incomplete shipments. These allowances are recorded when violations occur. Substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of
cost of sales.   

  We
establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating the amount earned when we
have completed our performance. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate. The majority of year-end receivables associated with
these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter. We have not historically had significant write-offs for these receivables.   

  39  

Table of Contents   

5. Advertising Costs     

  Advertising costs, which primarily consist of newspaper circulars, internet advertisements and media broadcast, are expensed at first showing or
distribution of the advertisement, and are recorded net of related vendor income.   

6. Earnings per Share     

  Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS includes the potentially dilutive impact of share-based awards outstanding at period end, consisting of the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and
the incremental shares assumed to be issued under performance share and restricted stock unit arrangements.   

(a)     Excludes 5.0 million, 15.5 million and 10.9 million share-based awards for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively,
because their effects were antidilutive.    

7. Credit Card Receivables Transaction     

  On October 22, 2012, we reached an agreement to sell our entire consumer credit card portfolio to TD Bank Group (TD) for cash
consideration equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Historically, our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful
accounts. With this agreement, our receivables are classified as held for sale at February 2, 2013, and are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value. We recorded a gain of
$161 million outside of our segments in 2012, representing the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful accounts and record our receivables at lower of cost (par) or fair value.   

On
March 13, 2013, we completed the sale to TD for cash consideration of $5.7 billion, equal to the gross (par) value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Subsequent to
year-end, and concurrent with the sale of the portfolio, we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables (2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate) at par of
$1.5 billion, resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.2 billion. As of March 20, 2013, we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash
proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt.   

  Following
this sale, TD will underwrite, fund and own Target Credit Card and Target Visa receivables in the U.S. TD will control risk management policies and oversee regulatory compliance, and we will
perform account servicing and primary marketing functions. We will earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the Target Credit Card and Target Visa portfolios. This transaction will be
accounted for as a sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.   

  40  

Table of Contents   

Beginning
with the first quarter of 2013, we will no longer report a U.S. Credit Card Segment. Income from the profit-sharing arrangement, net of account servicing expenses, will be recognized as an
offset to SG A expenses.   

8. Canadian Leasehold Acquisition     

  During 2011, we purchased the leasehold interests in 189 sites operated by Zellers in Canada, in exchange for $1,861 million. In addition, we
sold our right to acquire the leasehold interests in 54 of these sites to third-parties for a total of $225 million. These transactions resulted in a final net purchase price of
$1,636 million, which was included in expenditures for property and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   

As
a result of the acquisition, the following net assets were recorded in our Canadian Segment: buildings and improvements of $2,887 million; finite-lived intangible assets of
$23 million; unsecured debt and other borrowings of $1,274 million. The finite-lived intangible assets are recorded in other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position and have an amortization period ranging from 3-13 years.   

  The
acquired sites were subleased back to Zellers for various terms, which all end no later than March 31, 2013.   

9. Fair Value Measurements     

  Fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable
inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).   

(a)     There was one interest rate swap designated as an accounting hedge at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012. See
Note 21 for additional information on interest rate swaps.      (b)     Company-owned life insurance investments consist of equity index funds and fixed income assets. Amounts are presented
net of nonrecourse
loans that are secured by some of these policies. These loan amounts were $817 million at February 2, 2013 and $669 million at January 28, 2012.

Position    
     
   Valuation Technique    

Short-term investments  
     
  Carrying value approximates fair value because maturities are less than three months.  

Prepaid forward contracts  
     
      Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the market price of Target common stock.  

Interest rate swaps  
     
      Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation
model (   e.g.   , interest rates and credit spreads). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data. A credit-risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit
spreads.  

Company-owned life insurance investments  
     
      Includes investments in separate accounts that are valued based on market rates credited by the insurer.  

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statements
of Financial Position. The fair value of marketable securities is determined using available market prices at the reporting date and would be classified as Level 1. The fair value of debt is
generally measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments and would be classified as Level 2.   

(a)     Represents held-to-maturity investments and cash equivalents that are held to satisfy the regulatory requirements
of Target Bank and Target National Bank.      (b)     Represents the sum of nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables and unsecured debt and other borrowings, excluding
unamortized swap valuation adjustments and capital lease obligations.    

  As of February 2, 2013, our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value because they are classified as held
for sale. We estimated the fair value of our consumer credit card portfolio to be approximately $6.3 billion using a cash flow-based, economic-profit model using Level 3
inputs, including the forecasted performance of the portfolio and a market-based discount rate. We used internal data to forecast expected payment patterns and write-offs, revenue, and
operating expenses (credit EBIT yield) related to the credit card portfolio. Changes in macroeconomic conditions in the United States could affect the estimated fair value used in our lower of cost
(par) or fair value assessment, which could cause gains or losses on our receivables held for sale. A one percentage point change in the forecasted credit EBIT yield would impact our fair value
estimate by approximately $37 million. A one percentage point change in the forecasted discount rate would impact our fair value estimate by approximately $8 million. Refer to
Note 7 for more information on our credit card receivables transaction. As of January 28, 2012, we estimated that the fair value of our credit card receivables approximated par value.   

  The
carrying amounts of accounts payable and certain accrued and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.   

  42  

Table of Contents    

10. Cash Equivalents     

  Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase. These investments
were $130 million and $194 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. Cash equivalents also include amounts due from third-party financial institutions
for credit and debit card transactions. These receivables typically settle in less than five days and were $371 million and $330 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28,
2012, respectively. Payables due to Visa resulting from the use of Target Visa Cards are included within cash equivalents and were $34 million and $35 million at February 2, 2013
and January 28, 2012, respectively.   

11. Credit Card Receivables     

  Historically, our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of February 2, 2013, our
consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost (par) or fair value because they are classified as held for sale. Lower of cost (par) or fair value was determined on a segmented
basis using the delinquency and credit-quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts. Many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost (par) because
fair value exceeds cost. Delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value, which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables. Refer to Note 7 for more information on our
credit card receivables transaction.   

  Credit
card receivables are our only significant class of financing receivables. Substantially all past-due accounts accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are written
off when they become 180 days past due.   

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts     

  Historically, we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to the anticipated future write-offs of existing
receivables and uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimated future write-offs on the entire credit card portfolio collectively based on historical experience
of delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. We continue to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our U.S. Credit Card Segment, which allows
us to evaluate the performance of the   

  43  

Table of Contents   

portfolio.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is eliminated in consolidation to present the receivables at the lower of cost (par) or fair value.   

(a)     Write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges), and recoveries include
current period principal collections on previously written-off balances. These amounts combined represent net write-offs.    

  We monitor both the credit quality and the delinquency status of the portfolio. We consider accounts 30 or more days past due as delinquent, and we update
delinquency status daily. We also monitor risk in the portfolio by assigning internally generated scores to each account and by obtaining current FICO scores, a nationally recognized credit scoring
model, for a statistically representative sample of accounts each month. The credit-quality segmentation presented below is consistent with the approach used in determining our allowance for doubtful
accounts in our U.S. Credit Card Segment.   

Funding for Credit Card Receivables     

  As a method of providing funding for our credit card receivables, we sell, on an ongoing basis, all of our consumer credit card receivables to Target
Receivables LLC (TR LLC), a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. TR LLC then transfers the receivables to the Target Credit Card Master Trust (the Trust), which from time
to time will sell debt securities to third parties, either directly or through a related trust. These debt securities represent undivided interests in the Trust assets. TR LLC uses the proceeds
from the sale of debt securities and its share of collections on the receivables to pay the purchase price of the receivables to the Corporation.   

  We
consolidate the receivables within the Trust and any debt securities issued by the Trust, or a related trust, in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The receivables transferred to
the Trust are not available to general creditors of the Corporation.   

  Interests
in our credit card receivables issued by the Trust are accounted for as secured borrowings. Interest and principal payments are satisfied provided the cash flows from the Trust assets are
sufficient and are nonrecourse to the general assets of the Corporation. If the cash flows are less than the periodic interest, the available amount, if any, is paid with respect to interest. Interest
shortfalls will be paid to the extent subsequent cash flows from the   

  44  

Table of Contents   

  assets
in the Trust are sufficient. Future principal payments will be made from the third party's pro rata share of cash flows from the Trust assets.   

  In
March 2012, we amended the 2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate to obtain additional funding of $500 million and to extend the maturity to 2013. Parties who hold the Variable
Funding Certificate receive interest at a variable short-term market rate. Outstanding debt related to the 2006/2007 securitized borrowing was $1,500 million and
$1,000 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. Collateral related to these borrowings was $1,899 million and $1,266 million at
February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively. We repaid this borrowing at par and terminated the Master Trust concurrent with the closing of the credit card receivables
transaction described in Note 7.   

12. Inventory     

The majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method (RIM) using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. Inventory is stated at the lower of LIFO cost or market. The cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs
incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. The majority of our distribution center
operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed in the period incurred. Inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. The LIFO provision is
calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally measured retail price indices.   

  Under
RIM, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the inventory retail value. RIM is an averaging method that has
been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are currently taken as
a reduction of the retail value of inventory.   

  We
routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Activity under this program is included in
sales and cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
because of the virtually simultaneous purchase and sale of this inventory. Sales made under these arrangements totaled $1,800 million, $1,736 million and $1,581 million in 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively.   

13. Other Current Assets     

(a)     Includes pharmacy receivables and income taxes receivable.    

14. Property and Equipment     

  Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or lease terms if shorter. We amortize
leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term over the shorter of the assets' useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are
reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $2,120 million, $2,107 million and
$2,060 million, respectively. For income tax   

  45  

Table of Contents   

  purposes,
accelerated depreciation methods are generally used. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and were $695 million, $666 million and $726 million in 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively. Facility pre-opening costs, including supplies and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying value may not be
recoverable. Impairments of $37 million, $43 million and $34 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were recorded as a result of the reviews performed and project scope
changes.   

15. Other Noncurrent Assets     

(a)     Company-owned life insurance policies on approximately 4,000 team members who have been designated highly compensated under the Internal
Revenue Code and have given their consent to be insured. Amounts are presented net of loans that are secured by some of these policies.      (b)     See Notes 9 and 21 for additional
information relating to our interest rate swaps.    

16. Goodwill and Intangible Assets     

  Goodwill totaled $59 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012. No impairments were recorded in 2012, 2011 or 2010 as a
result of the goodwill impairment tests performed.   

(a)     Other intangible assets relate primarily to acquired customer lists and trademarks.    

We use the straight-line method to amortize leasehold acquisition costs primarily over 9 to 39 years and other definite-lived intangibles
over 3 to 15 years. The weighted average life of leasehold acquisition costs and other intangible assets was 29 years and 5 years, respectively, at February 2, 2013.
Amortization expense was $22 million in 2012 and $24 million in each of 2011 and 2010.   

46  

Table of Contents   

17. Accounts Payable     

  At February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, we reclassified book overdrafts of $588 million and $575 million, respectively,
to accounts payable.   

18. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities     

(a)     Gift card liability represents the amount of unredeemed gift cards, net of estimated breakage.      (b)     Straight-line rent accrual
represents the amount of rent expense recorded that exceeds cash payments remitted in connection
with operating leases.      (c)     See footnote (a) to the Other Noncurrent Liabilities table in Note 24 for additional detail.    

19. Commitments and Contingencies     

  Purchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment
purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts, were $1,472 million and $1,396 million at February 2, 2013 and
January 28, 2012, respectively. These purchase obligations are primarily due within three years. We issue inventory purchase orders, which represent authorizations to purchase that are
cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable
outlays incurred prior to cancellation.   

  We
issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Trade letters of credit totaled $1,539 million and $1,516 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28,
2012, respectively, a portion of which are reflected in accounts payable. Standby letters of credit, relating primarily to retained risk on our insurance claims, totaled $76 million and
$66 million at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively.   

  We
are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our
shareholders and other constituents. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that
any of the currently identified claims or litigation will be material to our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

20. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt     

At February 2, 2013, the carrying value and maturities of our debt portfolio were as follows:   

(a)     Reflects the weighted average stated interest rate as of year-end.      (b)     Includes $1.5 billion of nonrecourse debt
collateralized by credit card receivables. See Note 11.    

On March 13, 2013, we repaid $1.5 billion of outstanding nonrecourse debt as described in Note 7. As of March 20, 2013, we also have
open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our receivables portfolio to repurchase outstanding debt with original maturities between 2020
through 2038.   

  We
periodically obtain short-term financing under our commercial paper program, a form of notes payable.   

In October 2011, we entered into a five-year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that expires in October 2017. No balances were
outstanding at any time during 2012 or 2011.   

  In
June 2012, we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured fixed rate debt at 4.0% that matures in July 2042. Proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes.   

48  

Table of Contents   

  As
described in Note 11, as of February 2, 2013, we maintained an accounts receivable financing program through which we sold credit card receivables to a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned
subsidiary, which in turn transferred the receivables to a Trust. The Trust, either directly or through related trusts, sold debt securities to third parties.   

(a)     Includes repayments of $226 million for the 2008 series of secured borrowings during 2011 due to declines in gross credit card
receivables and payment of $2,769 million in 2011 to repurchase and retire in full this series of secured borrowings.    

Other than debt backed by our credit card receivables, substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are senior, unsecured obligations. Most of our
long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We
are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants, which have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends.   

  In
March 2012, we amended the 2006/2007 Series Variable Funding Certificate to obtain additional funding of $500 million and to extend the maturity to 2013. We repaid this borrowing at par and
terminated the Master Trust concurrent with the closing of the credit card receivables transaction described in Note 7.   

21. Derivative Financial Instruments   

  Historically our derivative instruments have primarily consisted of interest rate swaps, which are used to mitigate our interest rate risk. We have
counterparty credit risk resulting from our derivative instruments, primarily with large global financial institutions. We monitor this concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis.
See Note 9 for a description of the fair value measurement of our derivative instruments and their classification on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.   

As
of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, one swap was designated as a fair value hedge for accounting purposes, and no ineffectiveness was recognized in 2012 or 2011.

Periodic payments, valuation adjustments and amortization of gains or losses on our derivative contracts had the following impact on our Consolidated Statements
of Operations:   

The amount remaining on unamortized hedged debt valuation gains from terminated or de-designated interest rate swaps that will be amortized into
earnings over the remaining lives of the underlying debt totaled $75 million, $111 million and $152 million, at the end of 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

22. Leases     

  We lease certain retail locations, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, land, equipment and software. Assets held under capital leases are
included in property and equipment. Operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease beginning on the date we take possession of the property. At
lease inception, we determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. The lease
term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold
improvements is limited by the expected lease term.   

  Rent
expense is included in SG A expenses. Some of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments
adjusted periodically for inflation. Certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These expenses are
classified in SG A, consistent with similar costs for owned locations. Rent income received from tenants who rent properties is recorded as a reduction to SG A expense.   

(a)     Rent income in 2012 and 2011 includes $75 million and $51 million, respectively, related to sites acquired in our Canadian
leasehold acquisition that are being subleased back to Zellers for various terms, which all end no later than March 31, 2013.    

50  

Table of Contents   

  Total capital lease interest expense was $109 million in 2012 (including $78 million of interest expense on Canadian capitalized leases),
$69 million in 2011 (including $44 million of interest expense on Canadian capitalized leases) and $16 million in 2010, and is included within net interest expense on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

  Most
leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 50 years. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.
Assets recorded under capital leases as of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 were $2,038 million and $1,752 million, respectively.   

(a)     Total contractual lease payments include $2,039 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of
being exercised and also includes $181 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2013 or later.      (b)     Capital lease payments include
$3,323 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of being
exercised and also includes $947 million of legally binding minimum payments for stores opening in 2013 or later.      (c)     Calculated using the interest rate at inception for each lease.
     (d)     Includes the current portion of $21 million.    

23. Income Taxes     

51  

Table of Contents   

  Certain discrete state income tax items reduced our effective tax rate by 1.0 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points, and 2.4 percentage
points in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date.   

At
February 2, 2013, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $714 million, which are available to offset future income. We expect substantially all of these carryforwards,
which generally expire in 2031 and 2032, to be fully utilized prior to expiration.   

  We
have not recorded deferred taxes when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. These accumulated net earnings relate to ongoing operations and
were $52 million ($592 million earnings offset by deficits) at February 2, 2013 and $300 million ($483 million earnings offset by deficits) at January 28,
2012. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were repatriated.   

  52  

Table of Contents   

  We
file a U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed exams on the U.S. federal income tax
returns for years 2010 and prior. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.   

If we were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded, $142 million of the $216 million reserve would benefit the effective tax rate. In
addition, the reversal of accrued penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax
expense. During the years ended February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, we recorded a benefit from the reversal of accrued penalties and interest of
$16 million, $12 million and $28 million, respectively. We had accrued for the payment of interest and penalties of $64 million, $82 million and $95 million
at February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively.   

  It
is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to our other unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next twelve months; however, an
estimate of the amount or range of the change cannot be made at this time.   

24. Other Noncurrent Liabilities     

(a)     We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to general liability and workers' compensation claims. Liabilities associated with
these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General
liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.    

25. Share Repurchase     

  We repurchase shares primarily through open market transactions under a $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of
Directors in January 2012. During the first quarter of 2012, we completed a $10 billion share repurchase program that was authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007.   

53  

Table of Contents    

  Of the shares reacquired, a portion was delivered upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts as follows:   

(a)     These contracts are among the investment vehicles used to reduce our economic exposure related to our nonqualified deferred compensation
plans. The details of our positions in prepaid forward contracts have been provided in Note 27.      (b)     At their respective settlement dates.    

26. Share-Based Compensation     

  We maintain a long-term incentive plan (the Plan) for key team members and non-employee members of our Board of Directors.
The Plan allows us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or a
combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards). The number of unissued common shares reserved for future grants under the Plan was 24.9 million and 32.5 million at
February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively.   

  Compensation
expense associated with share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the minimum required service period. Total
share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $105 million, $90 million and $109 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
related income tax benefit was $42 million, $35 million and $43 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

Stock Options     

  We grant nonqualified stock options to certain team members under the Plan that generally vest and become exercisable annually in equal amounts over
a four-year period and expire 10 years after the grant date. We also grant options with a ten-year term to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors
which vest immediately, but are not exercisable until one year after the grant date. We use a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at the grant date.   

(a)     In thousands.      (b)     Weighted average per share.      (c)     Represents stock
price appreciation subsequent to the grant date, in millions.

Table of Contents   

(a)     Volatility represents an average of market estimates for implied volatility of Target common stock.      (b)     The risk-free interest
rate is an interpolation of the relevant U.S. Treasury security maturities as of each applicable grant
date.      (c)     The expected life is estimated based on an analysis of options already exercised and any foreseeable trends or changes in recipients'
behavior.    

At
February 2, 2013, there was $88 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 1.2 years. The weighted average remaining life of currently exercisable options is 5.1 years, and the weighted average remaining life of all outstanding options is
6.6 years. The total fair value of options vested was $68 million, $75 million and $87 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

Performance Share Units     

  We have issued performance share units to certain team members annually since January 2003. These units represent shares potentially issuable in the
future. Issuance is based upon our performance relative to a retail peer group over a three-year performance period on two measures: domestic market share change and EPS growth. The fair
value of performance share units is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value for performance share units was $58.61, $48.63 and $52.62 in
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

(a)     Assumes attainment of maximum payout rates as set forth in the performance criteria based in thousands of share units. Applying actual or
expected payout rates, the number of outstanding units at February 2, 2013 was 876 thousand.      (b)     Weighted average per unit.    

The expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. Future compensation expense for
currently unvested awards could reach a maximum of $24 million assuming payout of all unvested awards. The unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
0.8 years. The fair value of performance share units vested and converted was $16 million in 2012 and was not significant in 2011 and 2010.   

  55  

Table of Contents   

    Restricted Stock     

  We issue restricted stock units and restricted stock awards (collectively restricted stock) to certain team members with three-year cliff
vesting from the grant date. We also regularly issue restricted stock units to our Board of Directors, which vest quarterly over a one-year period and are settled in shares of Target
common stock upon departure from the Board. Restricted stock units represent shares potentially issuable in the future whereas restricted stock awards represent shares issued upon grant that are
restricted. The fair value for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted
stock was $60.44, $49.42 and $55.17 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

(a)     Represents the number of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, in thousands.      (b)     Weighted average per unit.

The expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. At February 2, 2013, there was
$103 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. The fair value of
restricted stock vested and converted was $11 million, $9 million and $3 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

27. Defined Contribution Plans     

  Team members who meet eligibility requirements can participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan by investing up to 80 percent of their
compensation, as limited by statute or regulation. Generally, we match 100 percent of each team member's contribution up to 5 percent of total compensation. Company match contributions
are made to funds designated by the participant.   

  In
addition, we maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for approximately 3,000 current and retired team members whose participation in our 401(k) plan is limited by statute or
regulation. These team members choose from a menu of crediting rate alternatives that are the same as the investment choices in our 401(k) plan, including Target common stock. We credit an additional
2 percent per year to the accounts of all active participants, excluding members of our management executive committee, in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation in a plan
of this nature. We also maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan that was frozen during 1996, covering substantially fewer than 100 participants, most of whom are retired. In this
plan, deferred compensation earns returns tied to market levels of interest rates plus an additional 6 percent return, with a minimum of 12 percent and a maximum of 20 percent, as
determined by the plan's terms. Our total liability under these plans is $505 million at February 2, 2013.   

  We
mitigate some of our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through investing in vehicles, including company-owned life insurance and prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock, that offset
a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These investment vehicles are general corporate assets and are marked to market with the related gains and losses
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur.   

  The
total change in fair value for contracts indexed to our own common stock recognized in earnings was pretax income/(loss) of $14 million, $(4) million and $4 million in 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively. During 2012 and 2011,   

  56  

Table of Contents   

  we
invested $19 million and $61 million, respectively, in such investment instruments, and this activity is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within other investing
activities. Adjusting our position in these investment vehicles may involve repurchasing shares of Target common stock when settling the forward contracts as described in Note 25. The
settlement dates of these instruments are regularly renegotiated with the counterparty.   

(a)     Includes market-performance credits on accumulated participant account balances and annual crediting for additional benefits earned
during the year.      (b)     Includes investment returns and life-insurance proceeds received from company-owned life insurance policies and other
investments used to economically hedge the cost of these plans.    

28. Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans   

  We have qualified defined benefit pension plans covering team members who meet age and service requirements, including in certain circumstances, date
of hire. We also have unfunded nonqualified pension plans for team members with qualified plan compensation restrictions. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team
members' date of hire, length of service and/or team member compensation. Upon early retirement and prior to Medicare eligibility, team members also become eligible for certain health care benefits if
they meet minimum age and service requirements and agree to contribute a portion of the cost. Effective January 1, 2009, our qualified defined benefit pension plan was closed to new
participants, with limited exceptions.

    Assumptions     

The discount rate used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year is the rate as of the beginning of the year (i.e., the prior measurement date).
With an essentially stable asset allocation over the following time periods, our most recent compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 5.7 percent, 10.0 percent,
7.8 percent, and 9.5 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively.   

The
market-related value of plan assets, which is used in calculating expected return on assets in net periodic benefit cost, is determined each year by adjusting the previous year's value by expected
return, benefit
payments and cash contributions. The market-related value is adjusted for asset gains and losses in equal 20 percent adjustments over a five-year period.   

  Our
expected annualized long-term rate of return assumptions as of February 2, 2013 were 8.5 percent for domestic and international equity securities, 5.5 percent for
long-duration debt securities, 8.5 percent for balanced funds and 10.0 percent for other investments. These estimates are a judgmental matter in which we consider the
composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual
basis, and revise it as appropriate. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long-term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce
volatility in our assets.   

  An
increase in the cost of covered health care benefits of 7.5 percent was assumed for 2012 and is assumed for 2013. The rate will be reduced to 5.0 percent in 2019 and thereafter.

    Plan Assets     

  Our asset allocation policy is designed to reduce the long-term cost of funding our pension obligations. The plan invests with both
passive and active investment managers
depending on the investment's asset class. The plan also seeks to reduce the risk associated with adverse movements in interest rates by employing an interest rate hedging program, which may include
the use of interest rate swaps, total return swaps and other instruments.   

(a)     Equity securities include our common stock in amounts substantially less than 1 percent of total plan assets as of
February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012.      (b)     Other assets include private equity, mezzanine and high-yield debt, natural resources and timberland funds, multi-strategy
hedge funds, derivative instruments and a 4 percent allocation to real estate.    

(a)     Passively managed index funds with holdings in domestic and international equities.      (b)     Investments in government securities and
passively managed index funds with holdings in long-term government bonds.      (c)     Investments in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and passively managed index funds with holdings
in long-term
corporate bonds.      (d)     Investments in equities, nominal and inflation-linked fixed income securities, commodities and public real estate.      (e)
     Includes investments in venture capital, mezzanine and high-yield debt, natural resources and timberland funds.      (f)     Investments in multi-strategy hedge
funds (including domestic and international equity securities, convertible bonds and other
alternative investments), real estate and derivative investments.    

(a)     Represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) from changes in values of those financial instruments only for the period in which the
instruments were classified as Level 3.

Position    
     
   Valuation Technique    

Cash and cash equivalents  
     
   These investments are cash holdings and investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV for the investment vehicles is based on the value of the underlying
assets owned by the fund minus applicable costs and liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.  

Equity securities  
     
       Valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.  

Common collective trusts/ balanced funds/ certain multi-strategy hedge funds  
     
       Valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted transactional price for participants in the
fund, which do not represent an active market.  

Fixed income and government securities  
     
       Valued using matrix pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.  

Private equity/ real estate/ certain multi-strategy hedge funds/ other  
     
       Valued by deriving Target's proportionate share of equity investment from audited financial statements. Private equity and real
estate investments require significant judgment on the part of the fund manager due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such investments. Certain multi-strategy hedge funds represent funds
of funds that include liquidity restrictions and for which timely valuation information is not available.  

Contributions     

  Our obligations to plan participants can be met over time through a combination of company contributions to these plans and earnings on plan assets.
In 2012 and 2011, we made discretionary contributions of $122 million and $152 million, respectively, to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. We are not required to make any
contributions in 2013. However, depending on investment performance and plan funded status, we may elect to make a contribution. We expect to make contributions in the range of $6 million to
$7 million to our postretirement health care benefit plan in 2013.   

    Estimated Future Benefit Payments     

  Benefit payments by the plans, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

29. Segment Reporting     

  Our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our investment and to make operating decisions.   

Note: The sum of the segment amounts may not equal the total amounts due to rounding.   

(a)     Consisted of 53 weeks.      (b)     The combination of bad debt expense and operations and marketing expenses, less amounts the U.S.
Retail Segment charges the U.S. Credit
Card Segment for loyalty programs, within the U.S. Credit Card Segment represent credit card expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the fourth quarter of 2012, bad debt expense was
replaced by net write-offs in this calculation.      (c)     Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which
the
U.S. Retail Segment charges the U.S. Credit Card Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. Loyalty program charges were $300 million, $258 million and
$102 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG A expenses within the U.S. Retail Segment and increases to operations and
marketing expenses within the U.S. Credit Card Segment.      (d)     The combination of Segment EBIT and the adjustment related to receivables held for sale represents earnings before interest
expense and
income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.      (e)     The combination of interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables and other net interest
expense
represents net interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.      (f)     Represents the gain on receivables held for sale recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations,
plus the difference between U.S.
Credit Card Segment bad debt expense and net write-offs for the fourth quarter of 2012.    

(a)     Represents the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful accounts and record our credit card receivables at lower of cost
(par) or fair value.    

(a)     Consisted of 53 weeks.

30. Quarterly Results (Unaudited)     

  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, fourth quarter operating results typically represent a substantially larger share of total year revenues
and earnings because they include our peak sales period from Thanksgiving through the end of December. We follow the same accounting policies for preparing quarterly and annual financial data. The
table below summarizes quarterly results for 2012 and 2011:   

Note: Per share amounts are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the quarters may not equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes
in average quarterly shares outstanding and all other quarterly amounts may not equal the total year due to rounding.   

(a)     The fourth quarter and total year 2012 consisted of 14 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively, compared with 13 weeks and
52 weeks in the comparable prior-year periods.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures            

  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the participation
of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

  There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

  1.              Definitions .  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the defined terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  The term  Committee  shall also include those persons to whom authority has been delegated under the Plan.  
     
  2.              Grant of Option .  Subject to the relevant terms of the Plan and this Agreement, as of the Grant Date, the Company has granted the Executive the number of Options set forth in the Award Letter.  
     
  3.              Purchase Price .  The purchase price of each Share covered by the Option, which is 100% or more of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, shall be as set forth in the Award Letter.  
     
  4.              Exercise .  Subject to Section 4(a), the Executive may exercise all or any part of the vested and previously unexercised portion of the Option at any time and from time to time until the Option expires, subject to the following provisions and subject to the terms of the Plan:  
     
  (a)            Shares Vested and Purchasable .  The right to purchase 25% of the Shares subject to the Option shall vest on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and the right to purchase an additional 25% of the Shares subject to the Option shall vest on each succeeding anniversary of the Grant Date until the Option is 100% vested (on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date).  The unvested portion of the Option may not be exercised.  
     
  (b)            Exercisable Only by the Executive .  Only (i) the Executive, (ii) the Executive s guardian or legal representative on behalf of the Executive, or (iii) the Executive s family member to the extent the Option or any part thereof is transferred to such family member pursuant to Section 7(b), may exercise the Option during the Executive s lifetime.  

(c)            Option Term .  Except as provided in Section 4(d) or the Plan, the Option shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date.  
     
  (d)            Termination of Service .  The Executive may exercise the Option after the Executive s termination of Service only as follows:  
     
  (i)             Early Retirement . Subject to Section 4(f), if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 45 and prior to attaining age 60, the Executive has been providing Service for 15 years or more (which 15 years need not be continuous), and the Executive has been providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the Executive s date of termination, the Executive may exercise the vested portion of the Option within the applicable extension period or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier.  The applicable extension period shall be: (A) 2 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs prior to attaining age 48, (B) 3 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 48 and prior to attaining age 52, (C) 4 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 52 and prior to attaining age 55, and (D) 5 years, if the Executive s termination of Service occurs after attaining age 55.  The Option shall continue to vest pursuant to Section 4(a) during this post-termination exercise period.  
     
  (ii)            Normal Retirement .  Subject to Section 4(f), if the Executive s termination of Service occurs at age 60 or older, the Executive has been providing Service for 10 years or more (which 10 years need not be continuous), and the Executive has been providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the Executive s date of termination, the Executive may exercise the vested portion of the Option within 10 years after the Grant Date.  The Option shall continue to vest pursuant to Section 4(a) during this post-termination exercise period.  
     
  (iii)           Disability .  If the Executive s termination of Service occurs because of Disability, the Committee determines that the Executive is totally and permanently disabled as such term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A and the Executive has been providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the date of termination, then the Executive may exercise the vested portion of the Option (A) within 5 years after such termination of Service or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier, or (B) within 10 years after the Grant Date, if on or prior to such termination of Service, the Executive has satisfied the age and years of Service requirements of  Normal Retirement  in Section 4(d)(ii).  The Option shall continue to vest pursuant to Section 4(a) during the extended Option exercise period under this Section 4(d)(iii).  The Executive shall inform the Company or a Subsidiary to which the Executive is providing Service (the  Service Recipient ) of any change in the Executive s Disability status.  In the event the Executive ceases to be permanently and  
     
  2    

totally disabled in the judgment of the Committee, the Option shall terminate 90 days after notice is mailed by the Committee to the Executive stating that the Executive is no longer eligible for an extension under this Section 4(d)(iii), or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier.  
     
  (iv)           Death .  In the event the Executive dies while a Service Provider and if the Executive was providing Service continuously from the Grant Date to the Executive s date of death, the otherwise unvested portion of the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable on the Executive s date of death.  The Option may be exercised by the Executive s beneficiary as designated on the form prescribed by the Company (the  Designated Beneficiary ), or if none has been designated, the representative of the Executive s estate or the person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by will or the laws of descent and distribution, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, within 5 years from the Executive s date of death, or 10 years after the Grant Date, whichever is earlier, provided that in either case the period for exercising the Option shall not be less than one year from the Executive s date of death.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if on or prior to the Executive s date of death, the Executive has satisfied the age and years of Service requirements of  Normal Retirement  in Section 4(d)(ii), the Option may be exercised within 10 years after the Grant Date, provided that the period for exercising the Option shall not be less than one year from the Executive s date of death.  In the event the Executive dies after termination of Service and prior to exercising all Shares under the Option, the Designated Beneficiary or the representative of the Executive s estate or the person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by will or the laws of descent and distribution may exercise the Option, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, but only to the extent vested on the Executive s date of death, and only within the time the Executive could have exercised the Option had the Executive survived, or one year from the Executive s date of death, whichever is later, but in no event later than 10 years after the Grant Date.  
     
  (v)            Cause .  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Committee concludes, in its sole discretion, that the Executive s Service was terminated in whole or in part for Cause, the Option shall terminate immediately and the Executive shall have no rights hereunder.  
     
  (vi)           Other Termination .  If the Executive s termination of Service occurs for any reason other than as specified in Sections 4(d)(i) through 4(d)(v) and the Executive has been continuously providing Service from the Grant Date to such date of termination, the Executive may exercise the Option within 90 days after such termination of Service (210 days if the Executive would be subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act on  
     
  3    

the date of termination), but only with respect to the portion of the Option that is vested at the time the Executive s Service terminates.  No additional vesting of the Option shall occur during this period.  
     
  (e)            Changes of Service .  Service shall not be deemed terminated in the case of (i) any approved leave of absence, or (ii) transfers among the Company and any Subsidiaries in the same Service Provider capacity; however, a termination of Service shall occur if (x) the relationship the Executive had with the Company or a Subsidiary at the Grant Date terminates, even if the Executive continues in another Service Provider capacity with the Company or a Subsidiary, or (y) the Executive experiences a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A.  
     
  (f)             Conditions to Extension .  As a condition to granting the post-termination extension periods described in Sections 4(d)(i) and 4(d)(ii), the Executive must enter into and not revoke a valid agreement with the Company containing a release of claims, a covenant not to engage in competitive employment and/or other provisions deemed appropriate by the Committee, in its sole discretion.  As a further condition to granting a post-termination extension period described in Sections 4(d)(i) and 4(d)(ii), if the Executive s termination of Service is voluntary, the Executive must have commenced discussions with the Company s Chief Executive Officer or most senior human resources executive regarding the Executive s consideration of termination at least one year in advance of the Executive s termination of Service.  
     
  5.              Manner of Exercise .  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised by following the then-current procedures for exercise that are established by the Company; provided, however, that if the Executive is subject to taxation on any portion of his or her Service income in Canada, he or she may not exercise the Option using the stock swap method.  
     
  6.              Taxes .  The Executive acknowledges that (a) the ultimate liability for any and all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ( Tax-Related Items ) legally due by him or her is and remains the Executive s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Service Recipient and (b) the Company and/or the Service Recipient or a former Service Recipient, as applicable, (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting and/or exercise of the Option; (ii) do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Executive s liability for Tax-Related Items; (iii) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction if the Executive has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event; and (iv) may refuse to honor the exercise or refuse to deliver the Shares to the Executive if he or she fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as provided in this Section.  
     
  The Executive authorizes and consents to the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, satisfying all applicable Tax-Related Items which the Company  
     
  4    

reasonably determines are legally payable by him or her by withholding from the Executive s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Executive by the Company and/or the Service Recipient.  In lieu thereof, the Executive may elect at the time of exercise such other then-permitted method or combination of methods established by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy the Executive s Tax-Related Items.  The Executive shall pay in cash to the Company or the Service Recipient any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Service Recipient reasonably determines may be required to withhold as a result of his or her participation in the Plan or his or her Option exercise that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  
     
  7.              Limitations on Transfer .  The Option shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged or encumbered by the Executive other than (a) pursuant to the terms of the Plan, or (b) by gift to a  family member  of the Executive (as defined in General Instruction A(5) to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933), provided that there is no consideration for any such transfer.  Subsequent transfers of a transferred Option shall be prohibited except for a re-transfer or re-assignment for no consideration by any of the persons or entities listed in clause (b) above back to the Executive.  Following transfer, this Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to the Option immediately before the transfer.  For purposes of any provision of this Agreement or the Plan relating to notice to the Executive or to acceleration or termination of the Option upon death or termination of Service of the Executive, the references to  Executive  shall mean the original grantee of the Option and not any transferee.  
     
  8.              Change in Control .  In the event of a Change in Control, the extent to which the Option shall become vested and exercisable shall be determined pursuant to the Plan.  
     
  9.              Recoupment Provision .  In the event of a restatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements that is caused, in whole or in part, by the intentional misconduct of the Executive, the Company may take one or more of the following actions with respect to the Option, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the  Compensation Committee ) in its sole discretion, and the Executive shall be bound by such determination:  
     
  (a)           cancel all or a portion of the Option, whether vested or unvested; and  
     
  (b)           require repayment of all or any portion of the amounts realized or received by the Executive resulting from the exercise of all or any portion of the Option or the sale of Shares related to the Option.  
     
  The term  restatement  shall mean the result of revising financial statements previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the correction of an error.  The term  intentional misconduct  shall be limited to conduct that the Compensation Committee determines indicates intent to mislead management, the Board, or the Company s shareholders, but shall not include good faith errors in judgment made by the Executive.

The Executive agrees that the Company may setoff any amounts it is entitled to recover under this Section against any amounts owed by the Company to the Executive under any of the Company s deferred compensation plans to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A. The Executive further agrees that the terms of this Section shall survive the Executive s termination of Service and any exercise of the Option.  This Section 9 shall not apply, and no amounts may be recovered hereunder, following a Change in Control.  
     
  10.           No Employment Rights .  Nothing in this Agreement, the Plan or the Award Letter shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued Service with the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, nor shall it interfere with or limit in any way any right of the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, to terminate the Executive s Service at any time with or without Cause or change the Executive s compensation, other benefits, job responsibilities or title provided in compliance with applicable local laws and permitted under the terms of the Executive s Service contract, if any.  
     
  (a)           The Executive s rights to vest in or exercise the Option after termination of Service shall be determined pursuant to Sections 4(d) and 5.  Those rights and the Executive s date of termination of Service will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active service would not include a period of  garden leave  or similar notice period pursuant to local law).  
     
  (b)           This Agreement, the Plan and the Award Letter are separate from, and shall not form, any part of the contract of Service of the Executive, or affect any of the rights and obligations arising from the Service relationship between the Executive and the Company and/or the Service Recipient.

If any Shares shall be issuable with respect to the RSUs as a result of the Executive s  separation from service  at such time as the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then no Shares shall be issued, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, prior to the first business day after the earlier of (i) the date that is six months after the Executive s  separation from service , or (ii) the Executive s death.  
     
  (c)                                       Change in Control   .

  (d)                                      Unvested RSUs   .  All of the RSUs subject to the Award that are unvested as of the time the vested RSUs are converted and Shares are issued under this Section 11 shall terminate immediately and the Executive shall have no rights hereunder with respect to those unvested RSUs.  
     
  (e)                                       Code Section 409A   .  Payment of amounts under this Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and this Agreement shall in all respects be administered and construed to give effect to such intent.

  The Executive authorizes and consents to the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, satisfying all applicable Tax-Related Items which the Company reasonably determines are legally payable by him or her by withholding from the Shares that would otherwise be delivered to the Executive the highest number of whole Shares that the Company determines has a value less than or equal to the aggregate applicable Tax-Related Items.  In lieu thereof, the Executive may elect at the time of conversion of the RSUs such other then-permitted method or combination of methods established by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy the Executive s Tax-Related Items.

  (a)                                     cancel all or a portion of the RSUs, whether vested or unvested, and any or all dividend equivalents related to the Award; and  
     
  (b)                                     require repayment of all or any portion of the amounts realized or received by the Executive resulting from the conversion of RSUs to Shares or the sale of Shares related to the Award.  
     
  The term  restatement  shall mean the result of revising financial statements previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the correction of an error.  The term  intentional misconduct  shall be limited to conduct that the Compensation Committee determines indicates intent to mislead management, the Board, or the Company s shareholders, but shall not include good faith errors in judgment made by the Executive.  
     
  The Executive agrees that the Company may setoff any amounts it is entitled to recover under this Section against any amounts owed by the Company to the Executive under any of the Company s deferred compensation plans to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A.

  15.                                    No Employment Rights   .  Nothing in this Agreement, the Plan or the Award Letter shall confer upon the Executive any right to continued Service with the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, nor shall it interfere with or limit in any way any right of the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, to terminate the Executive s Service at any time with or without Cause or change the Executive s compensation, other benefits, job responsibilities or title provided in compliance with applicable local laws and permitted under the terms of the Executive s Service contract, if any.  
     
  (a)                                     The Executive s rights to vest in the RSUs or receive Shares after termination of Service shall be determined pursuant to Sections 5 through 11.  Those rights and the Executive s date of termination of Service will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active service would not include a period of  garden leave  or similar notice period pursuant to local law).  
     
  (b)                                     This Agreement, the Plan and the Award Letter are separate from, and shall not form, any part of the contract of Service of the Executive, or affect any of the rights and obligations arising from the Service relationship between the Executive and the Company and/or the Service Recipient.  
     
  (c)                                      No Service Provider has a right to participate in the Plan.  All decisions with respect to future grants, if any, shall be at the sole discretion of the Company and/or the Service Recipient.  
     
  (d)                                     The Executive will have no claim or right of action in respect of any decision, omission or discretion which may operate to the disadvantage of the Executive.  
     
  16.                                    Nature of Grant   .  In accepting the grant, the Executive acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:  
     
  (a)                                     the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement, and any such modification, amendment, suspension or termination will not constitute a constructive or wrongful dismissal;  
     
  (b)                                     the RSUs are extraordinary items and are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or welfare or retirement benefits or similar payments;  
     
  (c)                                      in no event should the RSUs be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company or the Service Recipient, nor are the RSUs or the underlying Shares intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;  
     
  6    

(d)                                     the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;  
     
  (e)                                      the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Executive s participation in the Plan or the RSUs;  
     
  (f)                                       no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSUs resulting from termination of the Executive s Service (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws), and in consideration of the grant of the RSUs to which the Executive is otherwise not entitled, the Executive irrevocably (i) agrees never to institute any such claim against the Company or the Service Recipient, (ii) waives the Executive s ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and (iii) releases the Company and the Service Recipient from any such claim.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, the Executive shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims; and  
     
  (g)                                      the Executive is hereby advised to consult with personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the RSUs or the Plan.

Exhibit (10)V   

Target Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan  
     
  NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR  
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT  
     
  THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ) is made in Minneapolis, Minnesota as of the date of grant (the  Grant Date ) set forth in the award letter (the  Award Letter ) by and between the Company and the person (the  Director ) identified in the Award Letter.  This award (the  Award ) of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ), provided to you as a member of the Board, is being issued under the Target Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), subject to the following terms and conditions.  
     
  1.                                           Definitions   .  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the defined terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.  The term  Committee  shall also include those persons to whom authority has been delegated under the Plan.  
     
  2.                                           Grant of RSUs   .  Subject to the relevant terms of the Plan and this Agreement, as of the Grant Date, the Company has granted the Director the number of RSUs set forth in the Award Letter.  
     
  3.                                           Vesting Schedule   .  Beginning with the calendar quarter in which the Grant Date occurs, 25% of the RSUs shall vest on the last day of each calendar quarter of the year in which the Grant Date occurs (i.e., March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31) and any remaining RSUs shall become fully vested on December 31 of the year in which the Grant Date occurs (the  Final Vesting Date ).  
     
  4.                                           Circumstances that Accelerate the Vesting Date   .  All unvested RSUs subject to this Agreement shall become immediately vested if the Director ceases to be a member of the Board due to (a) death, (b) Disability, (c) reaching the mandatory retirement age for members of the Board, or (d) reaching the maximum term limit for members of the Board.  
     
  In the event a Change in Control occurs prior to the Final Vesting Date, a pro-rata portion of the RSUs shall become immediately vested, to the extent not already vested.  For this purpose a pro-rata portion of the RSUs shall be determined by multiplying the aggregate RSUs subject to the Award by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months that have elapsed since the Grant Date (rounded to the nearest whole month) and the denominator is 12.  

5.                                           Effect of Ceasing to be a Member of the Board   .  In the event that the Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason prior to the Final Vesting Date, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the unvested portion of the Award shall be forfeited.  
     
  6.                                           Dividend Equivalents   .  The Award is being granted with an equal number of dividend equivalents.  Accordingly, the Director shall have the right to receive additional RSUs with a value equal to the regular cash dividend paid on one Share for each RSU held pursuant to this Agreement prior to the conversion of RSUs and issuance of Shares pursuant to Section 7.  The number of additional RSUs to be received as dividend equivalents for each RSU held shall be determined by dividing the cash dividend per share by the Fair Market Value of one Share on the dividend payment date; provided, however, that for purposes of avoiding the issuance of fractional RSUs, on each dividend payment date the additional RSUs issued as dividend equivalents shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.  All such additional RSUs received as dividend equivalents shall be fully vested upon issuance, and shall be converted into Shares on the basis and at the time set forth in Section 7 hereof.  
     
  7.                                           Conversion of RSUs and Issuance of Shares   .  The Director shall receive one Share for each vested RSU on the date that is as soon as administratively feasible, but not more than 90 days, following the Director s death or other termination of service as a member of the Board and cessation of all contractual relationships as an independent contractor with the Company (or any other entity which would be treated as a single employer with the Company under Code Section 414(b) or 414(c)) which causes the Director to experience a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A; provided, however, that in the event the Company determines that the Director is a  specified employee  under Code Section 409A (or successor provision) and that such distribution is subject to Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), the issuance of the Director s Shares will be suspended until six months after the Director s separation from service, or if earlier, the Director s death.  Until such time as the Director s RSUs have been converted into Shares pursuant to this Section 7, the RSUs will not carry any of the rights of share ownership and will not be entitled to vote or receive dividends (other than the right to receive dividend equivalents).  
     
  8.                                           Limitations on Transfer   .  The Award shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged or encumbered by the Director other than pursuant to the terms of the Plan.  
     
  9.                                           Service as a Member of the Board   .  Nothing in this Agreement, the Plan or the Award Letter shall give the Director any claim or right to continue as a member of the Board.  
     
  2    

10.                                    Governing Law; Venue; Jurisdiction   .  To the extent that federal laws do not otherwise control, this Agreement, the Award Letter, the Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant to the Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts-of-law principles and shall be construed accordingly.  The exclusive forum and venue for any legal action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, and the parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. If neither subject matter nor diversity jurisdiction exists in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, then the exclusive forum and venue for any such action shall be the courts of the State of Minnesota located in Hennepin County, and the Director, as a condition of this Agreement, consents to the personal jurisdiction of that court.  
     
  11.                                    Currencies and Dates   .  Unless otherwise stated, all dollars specified in this Agreement and the Award Letter shall be in U.S. dollars and all dates specified in this Agreement shall be U.S. dates.  
     
  12.                                    Plan and Award Letter Incorporated by Reference; Electronic Delivery   .  The Plan, as hereafter amended from time to time, and the Award Letter shall be deemed to be incorporated into this Agreement and are integral parts hereof.  In the event there is any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern.  The Company or a third party designated by the Company may deliver to the Director by electronic means any documents related to his or her participation in the Plan.  The Director acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and the Award Letter.

   Termination of Employment      If your employment with Target terminates, either voluntarily or involuntarily (with or without cause), no further vesting of this award will occur.

   Taxes      Each award payment will be processed as additional taxable income on the payroll run for the pay period which covers the vesting date of such award payment, with such processing being performed in the ordinary course of business and subject to customary tax and other withholdings. You are responsible for all taxes payable on the award.  All payments are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A because they are short-term deferrals under Treas. Reg.

Repayment Obligation      I understand that if, prior to the final vesting date of this award, I:  
     
                         Accept employment with or become a consultant to any of the companies identified as Target s  Retail Peer Group  of competitors in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of Target s most recently filed Proxy Statement relating to an annual meeting of shareholders; or  
     
                         Recruit, solicit or entice, directly or indirectly, for employment, any employee of Target or any of its affiliated companies,  
     
  I will repay to Target the amount of this award that has already been paid by Target. If I fail to pay Target the amount due under this agreement, and Target resorts to legal action to collect the amount due, Target shall be entitled to collect from me, in addition to the amount owed, all reasonable costs and expenses associated with such collection (including without limitation attorneys  fees, court costs, and other costs related to such collection or legal action).  
     
  I have read this agreement, and fully understand my obligations.

registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange

15(d)-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
 
  a.    designed

material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
being prepared;      b.    designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to

significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and      b.    any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.

made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;      3.    Based
on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;      4.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15(d)-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
 
  a.    designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
being prepared;      b.    designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles;      c.    evaluated
the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of
the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and      d.    disclosed
in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal
quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting; and     
   5.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):  
 
  a.    all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and      b.    any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
