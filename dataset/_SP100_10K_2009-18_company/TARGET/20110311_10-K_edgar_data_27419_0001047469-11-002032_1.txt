PART I        

Item 1.    Business            

General   

          Target Corporation (the Corporation or Target) was incorporated in Minnesota in 1902. We operate as two reportable segments: Retail and
Credit Card.   

          Our
Retail Segment includes all of our merchandising operations, including our fully integrated online business. We offer both everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated
merchandise at discounted prices. Our ability to deliver a shopping experience that is preferred by our customers, referred to as "guests," is supported by our strong supply chain and technology
infrastructure, a devotion to innovation that is ingrained in our organization and culture, and our disciplined approach to managing our current business and investing in future growth. As a component
of the Retail Segment, our online presence is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly either online or by locating them in one of our stores with the aid of online research and
location tools. Our online shopping site offers similar merchandise categories to those found in our stores, excluding food items and household essentials.   

          Our
Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and the Target Card. Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary
Target Debit Card. Collectively, these REDcards  help strengthen the bond with our guests, drive incremental sales and contribute to our results of operations.   

Financial Highlights   

          Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to
fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2010 ended January 29, 2011, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2009 ended January 30, 2010, and consisted of
52 weeks. Fiscal year 2008 ended January 31, 2009, and consisted of 52 weeks.   

          For
information on key financial highlights, see the items referenced in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

Seasonality   

          Due to the seasonal nature of our business, a larger share of annual revenues and earnings traditionally occurs in the fourth quarter
because it includes the peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December.   

Merchandise   

          We operate Target general merchandise stores, the majority of which offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a more limited
food assortment than traditional supermarkets. During 2009 and 2010 we completed store remodels that enabled us to offer an expanded food assortment in many of our general merchandise stores. The
expanded food assortment includes some perishables and some additional dry, dairy and frozen items. In addition, we operate SuperTarget  stores with general merchandise items and a full
line of food items comparable to that of traditional supermarkets. Target.com offers a wide assortment of general merchandise including many items found in our stores and a complementary assortment,
such as extended sizes and colors, sold only online. A significant portion of our sales is from national brand merchandise. We also sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands. Owned
brands include merchandise sold under private-label brands including, but not limited to, Archer Farms , Archer Farms  Simply Balanced , Boots  
Barkley , choxie , Circo , Durabuilt , Embark , Gilligan   O'Malley , itso TM , Market Pantry ,
Merona , Play Wonder , Room Essentials ,

In addition, we sell merchandise under exclusive licensed and designer brands including, but not limited to, C9 by Champion , Chefmate , Cherokee ,
Converse  One Star , Eddie Bauer , Fieldcrest , Genuine Kids by OshKosh , Kitchen Essentials  from Calphalon , Liz
Lange  for Target , Michael Graves Design , Mossimo , Nick   Nora , Simply Shabby Chic , Sonia Kashuk  and
Thomas O'Brien  Vintage Modern. We also sell merchandise through unique programs such as ClearRx SM , GO International  and The Great Save SM .
Additionally, we generate revenue from in-store amenities such as Target Caf  SM , Target Clinic ,
Target Pharmacy  and Target Photo , and from leased or licensed departments such as Target Optical , Pizza Hut, Portrait Studio and Starbucks.   

Effective
inventory management is key to our ongoing success. We utilize various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We
achieve effective inventory management by being in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and
apparel items to minimize markdowns.   

Household essentials    includes pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning and paper products.   

   Hardlines    includes electronics (including video game hardware and software), music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods and toys.   

Apparel and accessories    includes apparel for women, men, boys, girls, toddlers, infants and newborns. It also includes intimate apparel, jewelry,
accessories and shoes.   

   Home furnishings and d cor    includes furniture, lighting, kitchenware, small appliances, home d cor, bed and bath, home
improvement, automotive and seasonal merchandise such as patio furniture and holiday d cor.   

   Food and pet supplies    includes dry grocery, dairy, frozen food, beverages, candy, snacks, deli, bakery, meat, produce and pet supplies.   

Distribution   

          The vast majority of our merchandise is distributed through our network of distribution centers. We operated 37 distribution centers,
including 4 food distribution centers, at January 29, 2011. General merchandise is shipped to and from our distribution centers by common carriers. In addition,
third parties distribute certain food items. Merchandise sold through Target.com is distributed through our own distribution network, through third parties, or shipped directly from vendors.   

Employees   

          At January 29, 2011, we employed approximately 355,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees,
referred to as "team members." During our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December, our employment levels peaked at approximately 400,000 team members. We consider our team member
relations to be good. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our team members. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies, depending on team members'
full-time or part-time status, compensation level, date of hire

and/or
length of service. These company-paid benefits include a pension plan, 401(k) plan, medical and dental plans, a retiree medical plan, disability insurance, paid vacation, tuition
reimbursement, various team member assistance programs, life insurance and merchandise discounts.   

Working Capital   

          Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period
from Thanksgiving to the end of December. The increase in working capital during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and short-term borrowings.   

          Additional
details are provided in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Competition   

          In our Retail Segment, we compete with traditional and off-price general merchandise retailers, apparel retailers, Internet
retailers, wholesale clubs, category specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce. Our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely
determines our competitive position within the retail industry.   

          In
our Credit Card Segment, our primary mission is to deliver financial products and services that drive sales and deepen guest relationships at Target. Our financial products compete
with those of other issuers for market share of sales volume. Our ability to positively differentiate the value of our financial products primarily through our rewards programs, terms, credit line
management, and guest service determines our competitive position among credit card issuers.   

Intellectual Property   

          Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, SuperTarget and our
"Bullseye Design," have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection for our private-label brands.   

Geographic Information   

          Substantially, all of our revenues are generated and long-lived assets are located within the United States.   

Available Information   

          Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge at www.Target.com (click on

Item 1A.    Risk Factors            

Our
business is subject to a variety of risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests with a brand they trust. Meeting our guests' expectations
requires us to manage various strategic, operational, compliance, and financial risks. Set forth below are the most significant risks that we face.   

  4  

Table of Contents   

    If we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.     

The retail business is highly competitive. In the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping
experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, guest service and marketing efforts. Guest perceptions regarding the
cleanliness and safety of our stores, our in-stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margin and expenses.   

    If we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margin and profitability could suffer.     

A substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend-right decisions in apparel, home d cor,
seasonal offerings, food and other merchandise. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost
sales, spoilage and increased inventory markdowns, which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations.   

    Our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Target, including our owned and exclusive brands.     

          We believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at Target and our team members choose Target as a place of employment is
the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary constituencies: guests, team members, the communities in which we operate and shareholders. To be successful in the future, we
must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Target's reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents that erode
trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse affects
on our business, including consumer boycotts, loss of new store development opportunities, or team member recruiting difficulties.   

          In
addition, we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands, such as Market Pantry, up   up, Target Home, Merona and Mossimo. These brands generally carry higher
margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our overall sales, totaling approximately one-third of sales in 2010. If one or more of these brands experiences a
loss of consumer acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin rate could be adversely affected.   

    We are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States.     

          All of our stores are located within the United States, making our results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health
of the U.S. economy. In addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: California, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Illinois, resulting in further
dependence on local economic conditions in these states. Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales
growth or reduction in overall sales, and reducing gross margins.   

          In
addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales, these same considerations impact the success of our Credit Card Segment. Deterioration in macroeconomic
conditions can adversely affect cardholders' ability to pay their balances, and we may not be able to fully anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending
credit, resulting in higher bad debt expense. Demand for consumer credit is also impacted by consumer choices regarding payment methods, and our performance could be adversely affected by consumer
decisions to use debit cards or other forms of payment.

Table of Contents   

    If we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce, our results of operations could be adversely affected.     

With approximately 355,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on
our ability to attract, train and retain a growing number of qualified team members. Many of those team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover
rates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, health care and other benefit costs and
changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, guest service levels and support functions could suffer. Those factors,
together with increasing wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth, and difficulty in executing plans for new stores, expansions and remodels
could increase our costs and capital requirements.     

          Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that
achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. In addition, for many sites we are dependent on a third
party developer's ability to acquire land, obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project, of which our store may be one component. Turmoil in the financial
markets may make it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect
our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing, expanding and remodeling our stores. A significant portion of our expected new store sites are located in fully
developed markets, which is generally a more time-consuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets.   

    Interruptions with our vendors and within our supply chain could adversely affect our results.     

          We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its
commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales. In addition, a large portion
of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, with China as our single largest source. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, increased
tariffs, currency exchange rates, the outbreak of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are
beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and/or adversely affect our results of operations.   

Failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.     

          If our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children's products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests'
expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety
laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food
or drug contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative guest perceptions
regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us
to regain the confidence of our guests.

Table of Contents   

If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our
reputation could suffer.     

          The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests. If we experience a data security
breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could
cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products, decline to use our pharmacy services, or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely
affect our results of operations.   

    Our failure to comply with federal, state or local laws, or changes in these laws could increase our expenses.     

Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our
workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer's
obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, and health care mandates. In addition,
changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit, Medicare reimbursements, privacy and information security, product safety or environmental protection, among
others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
particularly wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Given the geographic concentration of our stores, natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations.     

          Our three largest states, by total sales, are California, Texas and Florida, areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent. Such
events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our
distribution centers and stores, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   

    Changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations.     

          Our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors. Changes in the tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or
our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate. In addition, our effective income tax rate generally bears an inverse relationship to
capital market returns due to the tax-free nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities.   

If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our growth plans, liquidity and results of operations could suffer.     

          We are dependent on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans. In
particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures, the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to
fund seasonal needs for working capital, and the asset-backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio. In addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our
exposure to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. Disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements,
fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures.

A significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations.     

          We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process guest transactions and summarize results. Our systems are
subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly,
we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions, which
could adversely affect our results of operations.   

          In
2011 we expect to migrate our online presence (Target.com) from a platform currently operated by Amazon, Inc. to our own proprietary platform. If this new platform does not function
as designed, we may experience a loss of guest confidence, data security breaches, lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases.   

    Our announced plan to expand retail operations into Canada could adversely affect our financial results.     

          Our plan to enter the Canadian retail market is our first expansion of retail operations outside of the United States. Our ability to
convert the leased locations that we acquire from Zellers Inc. to Target stores depends in large measure upon our ability to negotiate acceptable modifications to existing lease terms, remodel
existing assets and recruit, hire and retain qualified team members. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to offer a full assortment of merchandise in
certain markets. The effective execution of our strategy is also contingent on our ability to
design new marketing and promotional programs that positively differentiate us from other retailers in Canada. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for Canada, our financial
performance could be adversely affected.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings            

The following governmental enforcement proceedings relating to environmental matters are reported pursuant to
instruction 5(C) of Item 103 of Regulation S-K because they involve potential monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000:   

We
were a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by the California Attorney General and a number of California District Attorneys in June 2009 alleging that we did not handle and dispose of
certain unsold products as hazardous waste and that we violated California's hazardous waste laws. A settlement was reached in this case on January 27, 2011, which obligates Target to pay
$22.5 million and consent to an injunction regarding future compliance with all California hazardous waste laws. The settlement was approved by the Alameda County Superior Court and judgment
was entered on March 2, 2011.   

          We
are the subject of an ongoing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). In March 2009, the EPA issued a Finding of
Violation (FOV) related to alleged violations of the CAA, specifically the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) promulgated by the EPA for asbestos. The FOV pertains to
the remodeling of 36 Target stores that occurred between January 1, 2003 and October 28, 2007. The EPA FOV process is ongoing and no specific relief has been sought to date by the EPA.   

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 requires SEC registrants to disclose if they have been required to pay certain penalties for failing to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service
their participation in listed transactions. We have not been required to pay any of the penalties set forth in Section 6707A(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

PART II        

Item 5.    Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities            

          Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TGT." We are authorized to issue up to
6,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0833, and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01. At March 7, 2011, there were 17,247 shareholders of record. Dividends
declared per share and the high and low closing common stock price for each fiscal quarter during 2010 and 2009 are disclosed in Note 29 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   

          In
November 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $10 billion of our common stock. Since the inception of this share repurchase program, we have repurchased
151.4 million common shares for a total cash investment of $7,827 million ($51.70 per share).   

          The
table below presents information with respect to Target common stock purchases made during the three months ended January 29, 2011, by Target or any "affiliated purchaser" of
Target, as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act.   

(a)       The table above includes shares reacquired upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts. For the three months ended January 29, 2011, 0.3 million shares were reacquired
through these contracts. At January 29, 2011, we held asset positions in prepaid forward contracts for 1.2 million shares of our common stock, for a total cash investment of
$51 million, or an average per share price of $44.09. Refer to Notes 24 and 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of these contracts.        (b)       The number of shares above includes shares of common stock reacquired from team members who wish to tender owned shares to satisfy the tax withholding on equity awards as part of our
long-term incentive plans or to satisfy the exercise price on stock option exercises. For the three months ended January 29, 2011, 13,398 shares were reacquired at an average per
share price of $59.72 pursuant to our long-term incentive plan.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations            

Executive Summary     

          Our 2010 Retail Segment sales increased 3.7 percent over last year due to a 2.1 percent comparable-store increase
combined with the contribution from new stores. Our Retail Segment EBITDA and EBIT increased 4.9 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. In the Credit Card
Segment, we achieved a significant increase in segment profit primarily due to declining bad debt expense driven by improved trends in key measures of risk.   

          Cash
flow provided by operations was $5,271 million, $5,881 million and $4,430 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We opened 13 new stores and 76 new
stores in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010 we remodeled 341 stores, significantly more than the 67 stores we remodeled in 2009. Additionally, during 2010 and 2009 we repurchased
47.8 million and 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share) and $479 million ($48.54 per share), respectively.   

          In
January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for
C$1,825 million (Canadian dollars), due in two payments, one in May 2011 and one in September 2011. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 Target stores in Canada,
primarily during 2013. We expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. At January 29, 2011 the
value of C$1.00 approximated the value of $1.00.   

          Additionally,
in January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit
card receivables portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of historical financing transactions related to our credit card receivables.   

          Management's
Discussion and Analysis is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Analysis of Results of Operations     

    Retail Segment     

EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.     

   EBIT is earnings before interest expense and income taxes.   

(a)      Loyalty Program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our Retail Segment. Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard
Rewards loyalty program, we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. These reimbursed amounts were
$102 million in 2010, $89 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG A expenses within the Retail Segment and
increases to operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.      

Retail Segment rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales.     

Sales     

          Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and our online business, as well as gift card breakage. Refer
to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Total sales for the Retail Segment for 2010 were $65,786 million, compared with
$63,435 million in 2009 and $62,884 million in 2008. All periods were 52-week years. Growth in total sales between 2010 and 2009 resulted from higher comparable-store sales
and additional stores opened, whereas between 2009 and 2008, growth in total sales resulted from sales from additional stores opened, partially offset by lower comparable-store sales. In 2010,
deflation affected sales growth by approximately 0.2 percentage points, compared with a deflationary impact of approximately 3.6 percentage points in 2009 and an inflationary impact of
2.2 percentage points in 2008.   

Refer to the Merchandise section in Item 1, Business, for a description of our product categories.

          Comparable-store
sales is a measure that indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a period over the comparable,
prior-year period of equivalent length. The method of calculating comparable-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable-store sales calculation is not
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.   

Comparable-store
sales are sales from our online business and stores open longer than one year, including:   

sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open           sales from stores that have been relocated to new
buildings of the same format within the same trade area, in which the
new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes    

Comparable-store
sales do not include:   

sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted, or relocated within the same trade area, to a SuperTarget
store format           sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled, expanded or reconstructed    

The comparable-store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with
comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length.   

          In
2010, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by an increase in the number of transactions and a slight increase in the average transaction amount, reflecting an increase in
units per transaction largely offset by a decrease in selling price per unit. In 2009, the change in comparable-store sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount, primarily due to
a decrease in the number of units per transaction, as well as a slight decrease in the number of transactions. The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive and consumer
behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.   

          Beginning
April 2010, all new qualified credit card applicants receive the Target Card, and we no longer issue the Target Visa to credit card applicants. Existing Target Visa cardholders
are not affected. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com.   

We
monitor the percentage of store sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration), because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental
purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder of the incremental purchases on the REDcards representing a shift in tender type.   

Since launching our new 5% REDcard Rewards program in October 2010, we have experienced an increase in REDcard penetration. REDcard penetration
for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 7.4 percent compared to 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.   

    Gross Margin Rate     

Gross margin rate represents gross margin (sales less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in cost of sales. Markup is the   

  16  

Table of Contents   

difference
between an item's cost and its retail price (expressed as a percentage of its retail price). Factors that affect markup include vendor offerings and negotiations, vendor income, sourcing
strategies, market forces like raw material and freight costs, and competitive influences. Markdowns are the reduction in the original or previous price of retail merchandise. Factors that affect
markdowns include inventory management, competitive influences and economic conditions.   

          Our
gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2010, unchanged from prior year, as margin rates within categories were generally stable and the impact of sales mix was essentially
neutral. There were no other significant variances in the drivers of gross margin rate.   

          Our
gross margin rate was 30.5 percent in 2009, compared with 29.8 percent in 2008. Our 2009 gross margin rate benefitted from rate improvements within categories,
partially offset by the mix impact of faster sales growth in lower margin rate categories (generally product categories of household essentials and food). The impact of rate performance within
merchandise categories on gross margin rate was an approximate 1.1 percentage point increase for 2009. This increase is the result of improved markups and reduced markdowns. The impact of sales
mix on gross margin rate was an approximate 0.4 percentage point reduction.   

    Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate     

          Our selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense rate represents SG A expenses as a percentage of sales. See Note 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of costs included in SG A expenses. SG A expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, as well as expenses associated with our credit
card operations, which are reflected separately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

          SG A
expense rate was 20.3 percent in 2010 compared with 20.5 percent in 2009 and 20.4 percent in 2008. The change in the rate in 2010 was primarily due to favorable
leverage of overall compensation expenses. The change in the SG A expense rate in 2009 was primarily driven by an approximate 0.4 percentage point impact from an increase in incentive
compensation due to better than expected 2009 performance compared with 2008 results, which was partially offset by an approximate 0.2 percentage point impact from sustained productivity gains
in our stores.   

    Depreciation and Amortization Expense Rate     

          Our depreciation and amortization expense rate represents depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. In 2010, our
depreciation and amortization expense rate was 3.1 percent compared with 3.2 percent in 2009 and 2.9 percent in 2008. The rate was essentially unchanged from the same period last
year. In 2009 the increase in the rate was primarily due to accelerated depreciation on assets that were replaced as part of our remodel program.   

    Store Data     

(a)       Includes 1 store relocation in the same trade area and 2 stores closed without replacement.        (b)       Reflects total square

    Credit Card Segment     

          We offer credit to qualified guests through the Target Visa and the Target Card. Our credit card program supports our core retail
operations and remains an important contributor to our overall profitability and engagement with our guests. Beginning April 2010, all new qualified credit card applicants receive the Target Card, and
we no longer issue the Target Visa to credit card applicants. Existing Target Visa cardholders are not affected. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all
purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com.
This new REDcard Rewards program replaced the existing rewards program in which account holders received an initial 10 percent-off coupon for opening the account and earned points
toward a 10 percent-off coupon on subsequent purchases. These changes are intended to simplify the program and to generate profitable incremental retail sales.   

Credit
card revenues are comprised of finance charges, late fees and other revenue, and third party merchant fees, or the amounts received from merchants who accept the Target Visa
credit card.   

(a)       Loyalty Program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our Retail Segment. Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty program,
we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. These reimbursed amounts were $102 million in
2010, $89 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG A expenses within the Retail Segment and increases to operations and
marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.        (b)       Amounts represent the portion of average gross credit card receivables funded by Target. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, these
amounts exclude $4,335 million, $5,484 million
and $4,503 million, respectively, of receivables funded by nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables.        (c)       ROIC is return on invested capital, and this rate
equals our segment profit divided by average gross credit card receivables funded by Target, expressed as an annualized rate.        (d)       As an annualized percentage of average gross
credit card receivables.

Table of Contents   

(a)       Balance-weighted one-month LIBOR.        (b)       Spread to LIBOR is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit
card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the
Prime Rate, and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.        (c)       As a percentage of average gross credit card receivables.

Our primary measure of segment profit in our Credit Card Segment is the EBIT generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the
interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables. We analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables. In
addition, we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar Spread to LIBOR at the portfolio level. This metric approximates overall financial
performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between EBIT earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire
portfolio. The interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to LIBOR.   

          Effective
April 2009, we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate (APR) applied to cardholder account balances. Under these terms,
finance charges accrue at a fixed APR if the benchmark Prime Rate is less than 6%; if the Prime Rate is greater than 6%, finance charges accrue at the benchmark Prime Rate, plus a spread. Because the
Prime Rate was less than 6% during 2009, the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed APR subsequent to this terms change. As a result of regulatory actions that impact our
portfolio, effective January 2010, we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum APR for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate, and
we eliminated penalty pricing for all current, or nondelinquent accounts. Penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time, generally 12 months, and is triggered
when a cardholder repeatedly fails to make timely payments. Additionally, beginning in August 2010 late fee limitations went into effect that resulted in reduced late fee revenue.   

          In
2010, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $541 million from $201 million, driven mostly by favorability in bad debt expense. The reduction in our investment in the
portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,604 million, a decrease of $318 million, or 16.5 percent, from the
prior year, which was primarily driven by lower average receivables as well as reduced late fees. Segment expenses were $980 million, a decrease of $644 million, or 39.7 percent,
from prior year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense due to lower actual and expected write-offs. Segment interest expense on nonrecourse debt declined due to a decrease in
nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables.   

          In
2009, Credit Card Segment profit increased to $201 million from $155 million as a result of improved portfolio performance (Spread to LIBOR) and significantly lower
funding costs. The reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment ROIC. Segment revenues were $1,922 million, a decrease of
$143 million, or 6.9 percent, from the prior year. The decrease in revenue was driven by a lower Prime Rate, lower average receivables, higher finance charge and late-fee
write-offs, and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late 2008 and April 2009. Segment expenses were
$1,624 million, a decrease of $118 million, or 6.8 percent, from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses, on both a dollar and rate basis.
Segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower LIBOR rate compared to the prior year.

(a)       Write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges), and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously
written-off balances. These amounts combined represent net write-offs.      

Our 2010 period-end gross credit card receivables were $6,843 million compared to $7,982 million in 2009, a decrease of
14.3 percent. Average gross credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 14.9 percent compared with 2009 levels. In response to regulatory changes and credit card industry trends, we have
undertaken risk management and underwriting initiatives that have reduced available credit lines for higher-risk cardholders. Additionally, we have experienced an increase in payment rates
and a decrease in charges at third-parties.   

          Our
2009 period-end gross credit card receivables were $7,982 million compared with $9,094 million in 2008, a decrease of 12.2 percent. Average gross
credit card receivables in 2009 decreased 4.0 percent compared with 2008 levels. This change was driven by the tighter risk management and underwriting initiatives described above, fewer new
accounts being opened, and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests, partially offset by the impact of lower payment rates.   

    Other Performance Factors     

    Net Interest Expense     

          Net interest expense, which includes the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables detailed in the
Credit Card Segment Results above, was $757 million for 2010, decreasing 5.5 percent, or $44 million from 2009 due to lower average debt balances and a $16 million charge
related to the early retirement of long-term debt in 2009, partially offset by a higher average portfolio interest rate of 5.3 percent in 2010, compared with 4.8 percent in
2009. In 2009, net interest expense was $801 million, decreasing 7.5 percent, or $65 million from 2008. This decline was due to a lower average portfolio interest rate of
4.8 percent in 2009, compared with 5.3 percent in 2008, partially offset by a $16 million charge related to the early retirement of long-term debt.

    Provision for Income Taxes     

          Our effective income tax rate was 35.1 percent in 2010 and 35.7 percent in 2009. The decrease in the effective rate
between periods is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters, which reduced income tax expense by approximately $100 million.   

Our
effective income tax rate was 35.7 percent in 2009 and 37.4 percent in 2008. The decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital
market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in 2009, compared with nondeductible losses in 2008. The 2009 effective income tax rate is also
lower due to federal and state discrete items.   

Analysis of Financial Condition     

Liquidity and Capital Resources     

          Our period end cash and cash equivalents balance was $1,712 million compared with $2,200 million in 2009. Marketable
securities of $1,129 million and $1,617 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve
principal and liquidity of our marketable securities. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in
60 days or less. We also place certain limitations on the aggregate dollars invested and percentage of total fund value held when making short-term investment decisions.   

Our
2010 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. Cash flow provided by operations was $5,271 million in 2010 compared with $5,881 million
in 2009. This cash flow, combined with our prior year-end cash position and the debt issuance described below, allowed us to fund capital expenditures of $2,129 million and pay off
$2,259 million of debt. In addition, in 2010 we increased our share repurchases and raised dividends paid to our shareholders.   

          Our
2010 period-end gross credit card receivables were $6,843 million compared with $7,982 million in 2009, a decrease of 14.3 percent. Average gross
credit card receivables in 2010 decreased 14.9 percent compared with 2009 levels. This change was driven by the factors indicated in the Credit Card Segment above. This trend and the factors
influencing it are likely to continue into 2011. Due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables, Target Receivables LLC (TR LLC), formerly known as Target Receivables Corporation (TRC),
using cash flows from the receivables, repaid an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) $566 million and $163 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, under the terms of our agreement
with them as described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the receivables balance continues to decline, TR LLC expects to continue to pay JPMC a
prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by JPMC would not exceed 47 percent.   

          Year-end
inventory levels increased $417 million, or 5.8 percent from 2009. Inventory levels were higher to support traffic-driving strategic initiatives, such
as our expanded food assortment in general merchandise stores and pharmacy, in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage. Accounts payable increased by $115 million, or
1.8 percent over the same period.   

          During
2010, we repurchased 47.8 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $2,508 million ($52.44 per share) under a $10 billion share
repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2007. In 2009, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of $479 million ($48.54
per share).   

          We
paid dividends totaling $609 million in 2010 and $496 million in 2009, an increase of 22.7 percent. We declared dividends totaling $659 million ($0.92 per
share) in 2010, an increase of 31.1 percent over 2009. In 2009, we declared dividends totaling $503 million ($0.67 per share), an increase of 6.8 percent over 2008. We have paid
dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.   

          Our
financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt
maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. As described in Note 19, in July 2010, we issued $1 billion of long-term debt at 3.875% that
matures in July 2020. There were no amounts issued in 2009.

          Our
ability to access the long-term debt, commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided ample sources of liquidity to Target in the past. Our continued access to
these markets depends on multiple factors including the economic environment, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. The ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating
agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing. As of January 29, 2011 our credit ratings were as follows:   

Credit Ratings

Poor's

(a)       These rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to JPMC.      

If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely
impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above.   

          As
a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio, representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges. Fixed charges include
interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. Our interest coverage ratio as calculated by the SEC's applicable rules was 6.1x in 2010, 5.1x in 2009 and 4.3x in 2008.   

          At
January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In past years, we funded our peak sales season working
capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued. In 2010 and 2009 we funded our working capital needs
through internally generated funds and the long-term debt issuance indicated above.

An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a
group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2010 or 2009 under this facility.   

          Most
of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a
debt leverage covenant. We are,
and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at January 29, 2011, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating
downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and
(ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for
possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.   

          We
believe our sources of liquidity will be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives during 2011, including our plan to enter the
Canadian retail market by paying C$1,825 million to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites currently operated by Zellers Inc. We may issue new long-term debt for these
and other initiatives, and we anticipate ample access to long-term financing. Further, in January 2011, we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables
portfolio, which may provide additional funding. As of January 29, 2011 the gross balance of our credit card receivables   

  22  

Table of Contents   

  portfolio
was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target.   

    Capital Expenditures     

          Capital expenditures were $2,129 million in 2010 compared with $1,729 million in 2009 and $3,547 million in 2008.
This increase was driven by higher capital expenditures for remodels partially offset by reduced expenditures for new stores. Our 2010 capital expenditures include $482 million related to
stores that will open in 2011 and later years. Net property and equipment increased $213 million in 2010 following a decrease of $475 million in 2009.   

In connection with the previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in Canada, we expect that renovation of these stores will
require an investment of over C$1 billion, primarily during 2012 and 2013, a portion of which may be funded by landlords.

    Commitments and Contingencies     

          At January 29, 2011, our contractual obligations were as follows:   

(a)       Required principal payments only. Excludes fair market value adjustments recorded in long-term debt, as required by derivative and hedging accounting rules. Principal
includes the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC at the principal amount. In the event of a decrease in the receivables principal balance, accelerated repayment of this
obligation may occur.        (b)       Total contractual lease payments include $1,949 million of operating lease payments related to options to extend the lease term that are
reasonably assured of being exercised.
These payments also include $28 million and $241 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores opening in 2011 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively.
Capital lease obligations include interest.        (c)       Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and
facilities.        (d)       Deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is
estimated based on
payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.        (e)       Estimated tax contingencies of
$397 million, including interest and penalties, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates
of the period of cash settlement.        (f)       These payments vary with LIBOR and are calculated assuming LIBOR of 0.25 percent plus a spread, for each year outstanding.
      (g)       Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.        (h)
       Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing related
contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are
cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be
obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table
as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.        (i)       In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to
220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for
C$1,825 million. At January 29, 2011 the value of C$1.00 approximated the value of $1.00. This commitment does not include future minimum lease payments on sites that may be selected in
2011.        (j)       We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional
amounts are required
to be funded as of January 29, 2011. Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic
discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements       We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements or financial
guarantees that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources.   

    Critical Accounting Estimates     

          Our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial
statements. Our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
could differ under other assumptions or conditions. However, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. Our senior
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items in our consolidated financial
statements require significant estimation or judgment:   

    Inventory and cost of sales       We use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales. Under this method,
inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's
ending retail value. Cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income. Since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the
lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts.
Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has
diminished. Inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change. Relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand, customer preferences, changing consumer credit markets or
increasing competition. We believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $7,596 million and $7,179 million at
January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, and is further described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Vendor income receivable       Cost of sales and SG A expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors. This "vendor income" is
earned for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and advertising allowances, as well as for our compliance programs. We establish a receivable
for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is
earned. The majority of all year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the
assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $517 million and
$390 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, and is described further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Allowance for doubtful accounts       When receivables are recorded, we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future
write-offs. This allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs based on historical experience of
delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends. Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. Accounts are automatically written off when
they become 180 days past due. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions;
however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the   

25  

Table of Contents   

factors
mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations. During 2010, we continued risk management and underwriting initiatives that reduced available
credit lines for higher-risk cardholders. In addition, we experienced an increase in payment rates and a decrease in charge activity from reductions in card usage by our guests. As a
result of these trends, our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our credit card receivables decreased $326 million, from $1,016 million, or 12.7 percent of gross credit
card receivables, at January 30, 2010 to $690 million, or 10.1 percent of gross credit card receivables, at January 29, 2011. Credit card receivables and our allowance for
doubtful accounts are described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Long-lived assets       Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group
are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the
carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. A 10 percent decrease in the fair
value of assets we intend to sell as of January 29, 2011 would result in additional impairment of approximately $12 million in 2010. Historically, we have not realized material losses
upon sale of long-lived assets.   

    Goodwill and intangible assets       We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined
using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth rates, and other factors. As of January 29, 2011 and
January 30, 2010, we had $223 million and $239 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. While we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and
intangible assets exceeds its carrying value, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or other factors could result in impairment losses.   

    Insurance/self-insurance       We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and
team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of
both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers'
compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was
$628 million and $653 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are adequate; however, our liabilities could be
significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our
self-insurance expense by approximately $30 million in 2010. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A for further disclosure of the
market risks associated with these exposures.   

    Income taxes       We pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. The benefits of uncertain tax
positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining whether it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. We periodically reassess
these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate. Liabilities for tax positions considered uncertain, including interest and penalties, were
$397 million and $579 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and postretirement health care accounting       We fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan. We also maintain several smaller nonqualified
plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in
the following paragraphs. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of
service.   

          Our
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market
conditions. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long-term rate of
return used. A one percentage point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual
expense by approximately $24 million.   

          The
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds as of the
measurement date, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Historically, this
same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year. Benefits expense recorded during the year is partially
dependent upon the discount rates used, and a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense
would increase annual expense by approximately $23 million.   

          Based
on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does
for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.   

          Pension
and postretirement health care benefits are further described in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

    Legal contingencies       We are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner
that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our
consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an
unfavorable ruling were to occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods.   

New Accounting Pronouncements     

    Recent Adoptions     

          In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, "Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 140" (SFAS 166), codified in the Transfers and Servicing accounting principles, which amends the derecognition guidance in former FASB Statement No. 140 and eliminates the
exemption from consolidation for qualifying special-purpose entities. We adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or
financial position.   

          In
June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)" (SFAS 167), codified in the Consolidation accounting principles, which
amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments significantly affected the overall consolidation analysis under former FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).
We adopted this guidance at the beginning of 2010 and the adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position.

Outlook     

          Our outlook is based on the application of business judgment in light of current business trends, our assumptions regarding the
macroeconomic environment, and estimates of the impact of current initiatives, the most significant of which are our store remodel program, the new 5 percent REDcard Rewards program, and our
planned Canadian expansion.   

          In
the Retail Segment, we expect that comparable-store sales will increase in the 4 to 5 percent range in 2011. We expect that our store remodel program will contribute
incremental comparable-store sales, and net of the adverse impact of remodel disruption, this impact will grow to a run rate of about 1.5 percentage points as we progress through the year.
Separately we expect that the sales contribution of our 5% REDcard Rewards program will grow more rapidly in its importance, adding up to 2 percentage points to our same store sales growth
later in 2011. These estimates are based on extrapolations of the current performance of these programs.   

          In
2011 we expect to produce a full-year EBIT margin rate consistent with 2010, due to favorable leverage of SG A and depreciation and amortization expenses offsetting the
gross margin rate declines associated with our store remodel and new rewards strategies. This offsetting impact is unlikely to
occur in the spring, particularly in the first quarter, resulting in modest pressure on EBIT margin rate in the spring, and modest favorability on this measure in the fall.   

In
our Credit Card Segment, we expect receivables will continue to decline in 2011, with the pace of the decline moderating as the year progresses. We expect that the allowance for
doubtful accounts will continue to decline in 2011 as well, due to this decline in receivables and expected continued improvement in portfolio risks. We also expect measures of our rate of portfolio
profitability to remain strong in 2011. Additionally, in January 2011 we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio. As of January 29, 2011 the
gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was $6,843 million, of which $3,954 million was funded by third parties and $2,889 million was funded by Target.   

In
January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million,
due in two payments, one in May 2011 and one in September 2011. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. We expect that renovation
of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. Our direct costs associated with entry into Canada may add expenses equating to an
earnings per share (EPS) equivalent in the range of $0.10 for 2011, an estimate that will continue to evolve over time. We currently believe the aggregate effect of our Canadian expansion could result
in a $0.15 to $0.20 unfavorable impact on 2011 EPS, reflecting direct incremental expenses and the indirect impact of the Canadian investment on the pace of share repurchase. We expect that the 2012
dilutive EPS impact of the Canadian expansion will exceed the 2011 dilutive EPS impact, due primarily to a full year of lease-related expenses.   

          We
expect 2011 capital expenditures related to our U.S. retail operations to be approximately $2.5 billion, driven primarily by a larger remodel program. We expect to open 21 new
stores in the U.S. in 2011, adding approximately 15 new locations net of closings and relocations.   

          We
also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase plan, although at a slower pace due to our Canadian expansion, investing in the range of $1.5 billion to
$2.0 billion during 2011. The timing and amount of share repurchase activity will be dependent on market conditions and the amount of future net earnings and cash flows.   

          We
expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36 to 37 percent.   

Forward-Looking Statements

such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our
actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A to this Form 10-K, which should be read in
conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking
statement.    

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk            

Our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations, some of which are at
a LIBOR-plus floating rate, and on our credit card receivables, the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a Prime based floating rate. To manage our net interest margin, we
generally maintain levels of floating-rate debt to generate similar
changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate. The degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments. At
January 29, 2011, the amount of floating-rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating-rate debt obligations by approximately $2 billion. As a
result, based on our balance sheet position at January 29, 2011, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt
obligations, net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately $2 million. See further description in
Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

          We
record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present value; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Periodically, in
certain interest rate environments, we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects
of interest rate changes. Based on our balance sheet position at January 29, 2011, the annualized effect of a 0.5 percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease
earnings before income taxes by approximately $10 million.   

          In
addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on
pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by $25 million at January 29, 2011. The value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates. To protect
against declines in interest rates we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust. At year-end, we had hedged
approximately 55 percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status.   

          As
more fully described in Note 14 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in
our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our
own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans. The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified
defined contribution plans (inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure) would not be significant.

Table of Contents   

We
do not currently have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the United States, and the vast majority of imported merchandise is
purchased in U.S. dollars. Our previously described agreement to purchase leasehold interests in Canada will expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar beginning in 2011.   

          Overall,
there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.

Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data            

    Report of Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements     

           Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity and presentation of the information in the Annual Report. The consolidated
financial statements and other information presented in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include necessary
judgments and estimates by management.   

           To
fulfill our responsibility, we maintain comprehensive systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in
accordance with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of
internal control provide this reasonable assurance.   

           The
Board of Directors exercised its oversight role with respect to the Corporation's systems of internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent
directors. The Committee oversees the Corporation's systems of internal control, accounting practices, financial reporting and audits to assess whether their quality, integrity and objectivity are
sufficient to protect shareholders' investments.   

           In
addition, our consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, whose report also appears on this page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements     

   The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

           We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of January 29,
2011 and January 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended January 29,
2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.   

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

           In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Target Corporation and subsidiaries at
January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2011, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.   

           We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 29, 2011, based on criteria established in    Internal Control Integrated Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    Report of Management on Internal Control     

           Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2011, based on the framework in    Internal Control Integrated
Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our assessment, we conclude that the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.   

           Our
internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2011, has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered accounting firm who has also audited
our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report which appears on this page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

   The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Target Corporation     

           We have audited Target Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2011, based on criteria
established in    Internal Control Integrated Framework   , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). The Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.   

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

           Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   

In
our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.   

           We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Target
Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders' investment for each of the
three years in the period ended January 29, 2011, and our report dated March 11, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     

1. Summary of Accounting Policies     

    Organization       Target Corporation (Target or the Corporation) operates two reportable segments: Retail and Credit Card. Our Retail Segment includes all of our
merchandising operations, including our fully integrated online business. Our Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa and
the Target Card. Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, these REDcards strengthen the bond with our guests, drive incremental sales and contribute to our results
of operations.   

    Consolidation       The consolidated financial statements include the balances of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and
transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of those entities'
operations. The variable interest entity consolidated is a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary through which we sell certain accounts receivable as a method of providing funding for our accounts receivable.   

Use of estimates       The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.   

    Fiscal year       Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years,
rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2010 ended January 29, 2011, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2009 ended January 30, 2010, and consisted of 52 weeks.
Fiscal year 2008 ended January 31, 2009, and consisted of 52 weeks.   

    Reclassifications       Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. Accounting policies applicable to the items discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement are described in the respective notes.   

2. Revenues     

          Our retail stores generally record revenue at the point of sale. Sales from our online business include shipping revenue and are
recorded upon delivery to the guest. Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return
merchandise within 90 days of purchase. Revenues are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns as a percentage of sales. Commissions earned on sales
generated by leased departments are included within sales and were $20 million in 2010, $18 million in 2009 and $19 million in 2008.   

Revenue
from gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption. Our gift cards do not have expiration dates. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relatively stable
percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed, referred to as "breakage." Estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions and was not material in
2010, 2009 and 2008.   

          Credit
card revenues are recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement. When accounts are written off, uncollected finance charges and late fees are
recorded as a reduction of credit card revenues. Target retail sales charged on our credit cards totaled $3,455 million, $3,328 million and $3,948 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.   

          Beginning
April 2010, all new qualified credit card applicants receive the Target Card, and we no longer issue the Target Visa to credit card applicants. Existing Target Visa cardholders
are not affected. Beginning October 2010, guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases at checkout every day when they use a REDcard at any Target store or on Target.com.
Target's REDcards include the Target Credit Card, Target Visa Credit Card and   

  37  

Table of Contents   

  Target
Debit Card. This new REDcard Rewards program replaced the existing rewards program in which account holders received an initial 10 percent-off coupon for opening the account
and earned points toward a 10 percent-off coupon on subsequent purchases. These changes are intended to simplify the program and to generate profitable incremental retail sales. The
discounts associated with our REDcard Rewards program are included as reductions in sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were $162 million in 2010, $94 million in 2009
and $114 million in 2008.   

3. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     

          The following table illustrates the primary costs classified in each major expense category:   

Cost of Sales    
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses    

Total cost of products sold including 
    Freight expenses associated with moving 
    merchandise from our vendors to our 
    distribution centers and our retail stores, and 
    among our distribution and retail facilities 
    Vendor income that is not reimbursement of 
    specific, incremental and identifiable costs 
Inventory shrink 
Markdowns 
Outbound shipping and handling expenses 
    associated with sales to our guests 
Payment term cash discounts 
Distribution center costs, including compensation 
    and benefits costs  
     
      Compensation and benefit costs including 
    Stores 
    Headquarters 
Occupancy and operating costs of retail and 
    headquarters facilities 
Advertising, offset by vendor income that is a 
    reimbursement of specific, incremental and 
    identifiable costs 
Pre-opening costs of stores and other facilities 
Other administrative costs  

The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.   

4. Consideration Received from Vendors     

          We receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions and
advertising allowances and for our compliance programs, referred to as "vendor income." Vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or SG A expenses based on the provisions of the arrangement.
Promotional and advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores. Under our compliance programs, vendors are charged for merchandise shipments
that do not meet our requirements (violations), such as late or incomplete shipments. These allowances are recorded when violations occur. Substantially all consideration received is recorded as a
reduction of cost of sales.   

          We
establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on provisions of the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating the amount
earned when we have completed our performance. We perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate. The majority of year-end receivables
associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter.   

5. Advertising Costs     

          Advertising costs are expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement and were $1,292 million in 2010,
$1,167 million in 2009 and $1,233 million in 2008. Advertising vendor income that offset advertising expenses was approximately $216 million, $179 million and
$188 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Newspaper circulars and media broadcast made up the majority of our advertising costs in all three years.   

  38  

Table of Contents   

6. Earnings per Share     

          Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted EPS includes the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based awards outstanding at period end, consisting of the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock
options and the incremental shares assumed to be issued under performance share and restricted stock unit arrangements.   

For the 2010, 2009 and 2008 EPS computations, 10.9 million, 22.9 million and 17.4 million stock options, respectively, were
excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive.   

7. Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)     

          Other comprehensive income/(loss) includes revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings under GAAP and are
recorded directly to shareholders' investment. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, other comprehensive income/(loss) included gains and losses on certain hedge transactions, foreign currency translation
adjustments and amortization of pension and postretirement plan amounts, net of related taxes. Significant items affecting other comprehensive income/(loss) are shown in the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders' Investment.   

8. Fair Value Measurements     

          Fair value is the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A
liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with
the creditor. Fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets);
Level 2 (observable market inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by
observable market data).   

  39  

Table of Contents   

          The
following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:   

(a)       There were no interest rate swaps designated as accounting hedges at January 29, 2011 or January 30, 2010.        (b)       Company-owned life insurance investments consist of equity index funds and fixed income assets. Amounts are presented net of loans that are secured by some of these policies of
$645 million at January 29, 2011 and $620 million at January 30, 2010.      

Position    
     
   Valuation Technique    

Marketable securities  
     
  Initially valued at transaction price. Carrying value of cash equivalents (including money market funds) approximates fair value because maturities are less than three months.  

Prepaid forward contracts  
     
      Initially valued at transaction price. Subsequently valued by reference to the market price of Target common stock.  

Interest rate swaps  
     
      Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation
model (   e.g.   , interest rates and credit spreads). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data. A credit risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit
spreads.  

Company-owned life insurance investments  
     
      Includes investments in separate accounts that are valued based on market rates credited by the insurer.  

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The fair value measurements related to long-lived assets held for sale
and held and used in the following table were determined using available market prices at the measurement date based on recent investments or pending transactions of similar assets, third-party
independent appraisals, valuation multiples or public comparables, less cost to sell where appropriate. We classify these measurements as Level 2. The fair value measurement of an intangible
asset was determined using unobservable inputs that reflect our own   

  40  

Table of Contents   

assumptions
regarding how market participants price the intangible assets at the measurement date. We classify these measurements as Level 3.   

(a)       Primarily relates to real estate and buildings intended for sale in the future but not currently meeting the held for sale criteria.      

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not measured at fair value in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The fair value of marketable securities is determined using available market prices at the reporting date. The fair value of debt is generally
measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments.   

(a)       Amounts include held-to-maturity government and money market investments that are held to satisfy the regulatory requirements of Target Bank and Target
National Bank.        (b)       Represents the sum of nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables, unsecured debt and other borrowings, excluding unamortized swap valuation
adjustments and capital
lease obligations.      

The carrying amounts of credit card receivables, net of allowance, accounts payable, and certain accrued and other current liabilities approximate
fair value at January 29, 2011.   

9. Cash Equivalents     

          Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase. Cash
equivalents also include amounts due from third-party financial institutions for credit and debit card transactions. These receivables typically settle in less than five days and were
$313 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010. Payables due to Visa resulting from the use of Target Visa Cards are included within cash equivalents and were
$36 million and $40 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively.   

  41  

Table of Contents    

10. Credit Card Receivables   

          Credit card receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are our only significant class of receivables.
Substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off. All past due accounts were incurring finance charges at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010.
Accounts are written off when they become 180 days past due.   

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    

          The
allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized in an amount equal to the anticipated future write-offs of existing receivables and includes
provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit-related fees. We estimate future write-offs on the entire credit card portfolio collectively based on historical experience of
delinquencies, risk scores, aging trends and industry risk trends.   

(a)       Write-offs include the principal amount of losses (excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges), and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously
written-off balances. These amounts combined represent net write-offs.      

Deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions in the United States would adversely affect the risk profile of our credit card receivables
portfolio based on credit card holders' ability to pay their balances. If such deterioration were to occur, it would lead to an increase in bad debt expense. The Corporation monitors both the credit
quality and the delinquency status of the credit card receivables portfolio. We consider accounts 30 or more days past due as delinquent, and we update delinquency status daily. We also monitor risk
in the portfolio by assigning internally generated scores to each account and by periodically obtaining a statistically representative sample of current FICO scores, a nationally recognized credit
scoring model. We update these FICO scores monthly, most recently in   

  42  

Table of Contents   

January
2011. The credit quality segmentation presented below is consistent with the approach used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts.   

Under certain circumstances, we offer cardholder payment plans that modify finance charges and minimum payments, which meet the accounting
definition of a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). These concessions are made on an individual cardholder basis for economic or legal reasons specific to each individual cardholder's circumstances. As
a percentage of period-end gross receivables, receivables classified as TDRs were 5.9 percent at January 29, 2011 and 6.7 percent at January 30, 2010.
Receivables classified as TDRs are treated consistently with other aged receivables in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts.   

   Funding
for Credit Card Receivables    

          As
a method of providing funding for our credit card receivables, we sell, on an ongoing basis, all of our consumer credit card receivables to Target
Receivables LLC (TR LLC), formerly known as Target Receivables Corporation (TRC), a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. TR LLC then transfers the receivables to the Target
Credit Card Master Trust (the Trust), which from time to time will sell debt securities to third parties, either directly or through a related trust. These debt securities represent undivided
interests in the Trust assets. TR LLC uses the proceeds from the sale of debt securities and its share of collections on the receivables to pay the purchase price of the receivables to the
Corporation.   

          We
consolidate the receivables within the Trust and any debt securities issued by the Trust, or a related trust, in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based upon the
applicable accounting guidance. The receivables transferred to the Trust are not available to general creditors of the Corporation.   

          In
2005, we entered into a public securitization of our credit card receivables. Note holders participating in this securitization were entitled to receive annual interest payments based
on LIBOR plus a spread. The final payment on this securitization was made in April of 2010 as discussed in Note 19.   

          During
2006 and 2007, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables by issuing a Variable Funding Certificate. Parties who hold the Variable Funding Certificate receive interest at
a variable short-term market rate. The Variable Funding Certificate matures in 2012 and 2013.   

          In
the second quarter of 2008, we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to JPMorgan Chase (JPMC). The interest sold represented 47 percent of the receivables portfolio
at the time of the transaction. In the event of a decrease in the receivables principal amount such that JPMC's interest in the entire portfolio would exceed 47 percent for three consecutive
months, TR LLC (using the cash flows from the assets in the Trust) would be required to pay JPMC a pro rata amount of principal collections such that the portion owned by JPMC would not exceed
47 percent, unless JPMC provides a waiver. Conversely, at the option of the Corporation, JPMC may be required to fund an increase in the portfolio to maintain their 47 percent interest
up to a maximum principal balance of $4.2 billion. Due to declines in gross credit card receivables, TR LLC repaid
JPMC $566 million during 2010 and $163 million during 2009 under the terms of this agreement. No payments were made during 2008.   

          If
a three-month average of monthly finance charge excess (JPMC's prorata share of finance charge collections less write-offs and specified expenses) is less than
2 percent of the outstanding principal balance of JPMC's interest, the Corporation must implement mutually agreed-upon underwriting strategies. If the three-month average finance
charge excess falls below 1 percent of the outstanding principal balance of JPMC's interest, JPMC   

  43  

Table of Contents   

  may
compel the Corporation to implement underwriting and collections activities, provided those activities are compatible with the Corporation's systems, as well as consistent with similar credit card
receivable portfolios managed by JPMC. If the Corporation fails to implement the activities, JPMC has the right to cause the accelerated repayment of the note payable issued in the transaction. As
noted in the preceding paragraph, payments would be made solely from the Trust assets.   

          All
interests in our Credit Card Receivables issued by the Trust are accounted for as secured borrowings. Interest and principal payments are satisfied provided the cash flows from the
Trust assets are sufficient and are nonrecourse to the general assets of the Corporation. If the cash flows are less than the periodic interest, the available amount, if any, is paid with respect to
interest. Interest shortfalls will be paid to the extent subsequent cash flows from the assets in the Trust are sufficient. Future principal payments will be made from the third party's prorata share
of cash flows from the Trust assets.   

(a)       The debt balance for the 2008 Series is net of a 7% discount from JPMC. The unamortized portion of this discount was $107 million and $177 million as of
January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010, respectively.      

11. Inventory   

          Substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales are accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method (RIM)
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventory is stated at the lower of LIFO cost or market. Cost includes purchase price as reduced by vendor income. Inventory is also
reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. The LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally measured retail price indices.   

Under
RIM, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value inventory. RIM is an averaging
method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are
currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.   

          We
routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Revenues under this program are
included in sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position because
of the virtually simultaneous purchase and sale of this inventory. Sales made under these arrangements totaled $1,581 million in 2010, $1,470 million in 2009 and $1,538 million in
2008.   

12. Other Current Assets   

(a)       Includes pharmacy receivables and income taxes receivable.

Table of Contents   

13. Property and Equipment   

          Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives or lease terms if shorter. We amortize leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term over the shorter of
the assets' useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired. Depreciation expense for
2010, 2009 and 2008 was $2,060 million, $1,999 million and $1,804 million, respectively. For income tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are generally used. Repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and were $726 million in 2010, $632 million in 2009 and $609 million in 2008. Facility pre-opening costs, including supplies
and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying value may not
be recoverable. Impairments of $28 million in 2010, $49 million in 2009 and $2 million in 2008 were recorded as a result of the reviews performed. Additionally, due to project
scope changes, we wrote off capitalized construction in progress costs of $6 million in 2010, $37 million in 2009 and $26 million in 2008.   

14. Other Noncurrent Assets   

(a)       Company-owned life insurance policies on approximately 4,000 team members who are designated highly compensated under the Internal Revenue Code and have given their consent to be
insured. Amounts are presented net of loans that are secured by some of these policies.        (b)       See Notes 8 and 20 for additional information relating to our interest rate
swaps.      

15. Goodwill and Intangible Assets   

          Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded within other noncurrent assets. Goodwill totaled $59 million at January 29,
2011 and January 30, 2010. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; instead, they are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected economic useful life and are tested for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow models are used in determining fair value   

45  

Table of Contents   

for
the purposes of the required goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests. No material impairments were recorded in 2010, 2009 or 2008 as a result of the tests performed.   

(a)       Other intangible assets relate primarily to acquired customer lists and trademarks.      

Amortization is computed on definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that typically
range from 9 to 39 years for leasehold acquisition costs and from 3 to 15 years for other intangible assets. The weighted average life of leasehold acquisition costs and other intangible
assets was 29 years and 4 years, respectively, at January 29, 2011. Amortization expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $24 million, $24 million and $21 million,
respectively.   

16. Accounts Payable   

          We reclassify book overdrafts to accounts payable at period end. Overdrafts reclassified to accounts payable were $558 million
at January 29, 2011 and $518 million at January 30, 2010.   

17. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities   

(a)       Taxes payable consist of real estate, team member withholdings and sales tax liabilities.        (b)       Gift card liability
represents the amount of gift cards that have been issued but have not been redeemed, net of estimated breakage.        (c)       Straight-line rent accrual represents the amount of rent
expense recorded that exceeds cash payments remitted in connection with operating leases.      

18. Commitments and Contingencies   

          In January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by
Zellers Inc., in exchange for C$1,825 million (Canadian dollars), due in two payments, one in May 2011 and one in September 2011. We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to
150 Target stores in   

46  

Table of Contents   

Canada,
primarily during 2013. We expect that renovation of these stores will require an investment of over C$1 billion, a portion of which may be funded by landlords. At January 29,
2011 the value of C$1.00 approximated the value of $1.00.   

          Purchase
obligations, which include all legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related
contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts, were approximately $1,907 million and $2,016 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010,
respectively. We issue inventory purchase orders, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. If
we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course
of business, which are not obligations given they are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.   

          Trade
letters of credit totaled $1,522 million and $1,484 million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, a portion of which are reflected in
accounts payable. Standby letters of credit, relating primarily to retained risk on our insurance claims, totaled $71 million and $72 million at January 29, 2011 and
January 30, 2010, respectively.   

          We
are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest
of our shareholders and other constituents. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe
that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.   

19. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt   

          We obtain short-term financing throughout the year under our commercial paper program, a form of notes payable.

An additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a
group of banks in April 2007, which will expire in April 2012. No balances were outstanding at any time during 2010 or 2009 under this credit facility.   

In
July 2010, we issued $1 billion of long-term debt at 3.875% that matures in July 2020. There were no amounts issued in 2009.   

47  

Table of Contents    

          As further explained in Note 10, we maintain an accounts receivable financing program through which we sell credit card receivables to a bankruptcy remote,
wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn transfers the receivables to a Trust. The Trust, either directly or through related trusts, sells debt securities to third parties. The following summarizes this
activity for 2009 and 2010.   

(a)       Represents the accretion of the 7 percent discount on the 47 percent interest in credit card receivables sold to JPMC.        (b)
       Includes repayments of $566 million and $163 million for the 2008 series of secured borrowings during 2010 and 2009 due to declines in gross credit card receivables and
payment of $900 million to repurchase and retire in full the 2005 series of secured borrowings at par in April 2010, that otherwise would have matured in October 2010.      

Other than debt backed by our credit card receivables and other immaterial borrowings, all of our outstanding borrowings are senior, unsecured
obligations.   

          At
January 29, 2011, the carrying value and maturities of our debt portfolio, including unamortized hedged debt valuation gains from terminated or de-designated
interest rate swaps, were as follows:   

(a)       Reflects the weighted average stated interest rate as of year-end.      

Required principal payments on notes and debentures over the next five years, excluding capital lease obligations, are as follows:   

(a)       The required principal payments presented in this table do not consider the potential accelerated repayment requirements under our agreement with JPMC in the event of a decrease in
credit card receivables.      

Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant,
our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants.   

  48  

Table of Contents   

20. Derivative Financial Instruments   

          Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Historically our
derivative instruments have primarily consisted of interest rate swaps. We use these derivatives to mitigate our interest rate risk. We have counterparty credit risk resulting from our derivative
instruments. This risk lies primarily with two global financial institutions. We monitor this concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis.   

Prior
to 2009, the majority of our derivative instruments qualified for fair value hedge accounting treatment. The changes in market value of an interest rate swap, as well as the
offsetting change in market value of the hedged debt, were recognized within earnings in the current period. We assessed at the inception of the hedge whether the hedging derivatives were highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. Ineffectiveness resulted when changes in the market value of the hedged debt were not completely offset by changes in the
market value of the interest rate swap. For those derivatives whose terms met the conditions of the "short-cut method," 100 percent hedge effectiveness was assumed. There was no
ineffectiveness recognized in 2010, 2009 or 2008 related to our derivative instruments. As detailed below, at January 29, 2011, there were no derivative instruments designated as accounting
hedges.   

          During
the first quarter of 2008, we terminated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $3,125 million for cash proceeds of
$160 million, which are classified within other operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These swaps were designated as hedges; therefore, concurrent with their
terminations, we were required to stop making market value adjustments to the associated hedged debt. Gains realized upon termination will be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the
associated hedged debt.   

          Additionally,
during 2008, we de-designated certain "pay floating" interest rate swaps, and upon de-designation, these swaps no longer qualified for hedge
accounting treatment. As a result of the de-designation, the unrealized gains on these swaps determined at the date of de-designation will be amortized into earnings over the
remaining lives of the previously hedged items.   

          In
2010, 2009 and 2008, total net gains amortized into net interest expense for terminated and de-designated swaps were $45 million, $60 million and
$55 million, respectively. The amount remaining on unamortized hedged debt valuation gains from terminated and de-designated interest rate swaps that will be amortized into earnings
over the remaining lives of the previously hedged debt totaled $152 million, $197 million and $263 million, at the end of 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   

          Simultaneous
to the de-designations during 2008, we entered into "pay fixed" swaps to economically hedge the risks associated with the de-designated "pay
floating" swaps. These swaps are not designated as hedging instruments and along with the de-designated "pay floating" swaps are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis.   

  49  

Table of Contents   

  Changes
in fair value measurements are a component of net interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   

Periodic payments, valuation adjustments and amortization of gains or losses from the termination or de-designation of derivative
contracts are summarized below:   

21. Leases   

          We lease certain retail locations, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, land, equipment and software. Assets held under
capital leases are included in property and equipment. Operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease beginning on the date we take possession of
the property. At lease inception, we determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole
discretion. The expected lease term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the depreciable life of
leased buildings and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term.   

          Rent
expense is included in SG A expenses. Some of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels. Certain leases require us
to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These expenses are classified in   

  50  

Table of Contents   

SG A,
consistent with similar costs for owned locations. Sublease income received from tenants who rent properties is recorded as a reduction to SG A expense.   

Most long-term leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to more than
50 years. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.   

(a)       Total contractual lease payments include $1,949 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of being exercised and also includes
$241 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that will open in 2011 or later.        (b)       Calculated using the interest rate at inception for each lease.
      (c)       Includes the current portion of $12 million.      

The future minimum lease payments above do not include any payments associated with the leases that may be acquired under our agreement with
Zellers Inc., described in Note 18.   

22. Income Taxes   

          Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for
the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date. We have not
recorded deferred taxes when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Such amounts are not significant.   

51  

Table of Contents    

          Certain discrete state tax items reduced the impact of the state income tax rate, net of federal benefit, by 2.4 percentage points, 0.7 percentage
points, and 0.6 percentage points in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.   

We file a U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S.
federal income tax examinations for years before 2009 and, with few exceptions, are no longer subject to state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years
before 2003.   

If the Corporation were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefit liabilities recorded, approximately $198 million of the
$302 million reserve would benefit the effective tax rate. In addition, the reversal of accrued penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties
associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are recorded within income tax expense. During the years ended January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, we recorded a net benefit from
the reversal of accrued penalties and interest of approximately $28 million and $10 million, respectively. During the year ended January 31, 2009, we recorded a net expense for
accrued penalties   

  52  

Table of Contents   

  and
interest of approximately $33 million. We had accrued for the payment of interest and penalties of approximately $95 million at January 29, 2011 and $127 million at
January 30, 2010.   

          The
January 30, 2010 liability for uncertain tax positions included $133 million for tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility was highly certain, but for which
there was uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. During 2010, we filed a tax accounting method change that resolved the uncertainty surrounding the timing of deductions for these tax
positions, resulting in a $133 million decrease to our unrecognized tax benefit liability and no impact on income tax expense in 2010.   

          In
addition, we resolved various state income tax matters in 2010, resulting in a reduction of approximately $80 million to our unrecognized tax benefit liability, which also
reduced tax expense in 2010. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities with respect to our other unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during
the next twelve months; however an estimate of the amount or range of the change cannot be made at this time.   

          During
2009, we filed income tax returns that included tax accounting method changes allowed under applicable tax regulations. These changes resulted in a substantial increase in tax
deductions related to property and equipment, resulting in an increase in noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $300 million and a corresponding increase in current income
taxes receivable, which is classified as other current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. These changes did not affect income tax expense for 2009.   

23. Other Noncurrent Liabilities   

(a)       We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability and workers' compensation claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both
claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation
liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.      

24. Share Repurchase   

          In November 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program totaling $10 billion that replaced a prior program.
In November 2008, we announced that, in light of our business outlook, we were temporarily suspending our open-market share repurchase program. In January 2010, we resumed
open-market purchases of shares under this program.   

          Share
repurchases for the last three years, repurchased primarily through open market transactions, were as follows:   

53  

Table of Contents    

          Of the shares reacquired, a portion was delivered upon settlement of prepaid forward contracts as follows:   

(a)       These contracts are among the investment vehicles used to reduce our economic exposure related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The details of our positions in prepaid
forward contracts have been provided in Note 26.        (b)       At their respective settlement dates.      

Our share repurchases during 2008 included 30 million shares that were acquired through the exercise of call options.   

(a)       Paid in January 2008.      

25. Share-Based Compensation   

          We maintain a long-term incentive plan (the Plan) for key team members and non-employee members of our Board of
Directors. Our long-term incentive plan allows us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock
units, restricted stock awards or a combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards). The number of unissued common shares reserved for future grants under the Plan was 17,552,454 at
January 29, 2011 and 21,450,009 at January 30, 2010.   

          Total
share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was $109 million, $103 million and $72 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The related income tax benefit was $43 million, $40 million and $28 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   

   Stock
Options    

          We
grant nonqualified stock options to certain team members under the Plan that generally vest and become exercisable annually in equal amounts over a
four-year period and expire 10 years after the grant date. We also grant options to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors which vest immediately and become
exercisable after one year with a term equal to the lesser of 10 years from date of grant or 5 years following   

  54

(a)       Includes stock appreciation rights granted to certain non-U.S. team members.        (b)       In thousands.
      (c)       Weighted average per share.        (d)       Represents stock price appreciation subsequent to the grant date,

We use a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at grant date based on the assumptions noted in the following
table. Volatility represents an average of market estimates for implied volatility of Target common stock. The expected life is estimated based on an analysis of options already exercised and any
foreseeable trends or changes in recipients' behavior. The risk-free interest rate is an interpolation of the relevant U.S. Treasury security maturities as of each applicable grant date.   

Compensation expense associated with stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or
the minimum required service period. At January 29, 2011, there was $120 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. The weighted average remaining life of currently exercisable options is 5.4 years, and the weighted average remaining life of all
outstanding options is 6.7 years. The total fair value of options vested was $87 million, $85 million and $69 million, in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   

   Performance
Share Units    

          We
have issued performance share units to certain team members annually since January 2003. These units represent shares potentially issuable in the
future; historically, the units have been issued based upon the attainment of certain compound annual growth rates in revenue and EPS over a three-year performance period. Beginning with
the March 2009 grant, issuance is based upon our performance relative to a retail peer group over a three-year performance period on two measures: domestic market share change and
EPS growth. The fair value of   

  55  

Table of Contents   

performance
share units is calculated based on the stock price at the time of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value for performance share units was $52.62 in 2010, $27.18 in 2009 and
$51.68 in 2008.   

(a)       Assumes attainment of maximum payout rates as set forth in the performance criteria based in thousands of share units. Applying actual or expected payout rates, the number of
outstanding units at January 29, 2011 was 1,046.        (b)       Weighted average per unit.        (c)       Because the
performance criteria were not met, approximately 728 thousand of these performance share units outstanding at January 29, 2011 were not earned and will be
forfeited in the first quarter of 2011.      

Compensation expense associated with unvested performance share units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
vesting period or the minimum required service period. The expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. Future compensation
expense for currently unvested awards could reach a maximum of $16 million assuming payout of all unvested awards. The unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 0.8 years. The fair value of performance share units vested and converted was $0 in 2010, $1 million in 2009, and $36 million in 2008.   

   Restricted
Stock    

          We
issue restricted stock units and restricted stock awards (collectively restricted stock) to certain team members with three-year cliff vesting
from the date of grant. We also regularly issue restricted stock units to our Board of Directors, which vest quarterly over a one-year period and are settled in shares of Target common
stock upon departure from the Board. Restricted stock units represent shares potentially issuable in the future whereas restricted stock awards represent shares issued upon grant that are restricted.
The fair value for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is calculated based on the stock price at the time of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted stock was
$55.17 in 2010, $49.41 in 2009 and $34.64 in 2008.   

(a)       Represents the number of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, in thousands.        (b)       Weighted average per
unit.      

Compensation expense associated with unvested restricted stock is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting
period or the minimum required service period. The expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. At January 29, 2011,
there was $33 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. The fair
value of restricted stock vested and converted was $3 million in 2010, $12 million in 2009, and $3 million in 2008.

26. Defined Contribution Plans   

          Team members who meet certain eligibility requirements can participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan by investing up to
80 percent of their compensation, as limited by statute or regulation. Generally, we match 100 percent of each team member's contribution up to 5 percent of total compensation.
Company match contributions are made to the fund designated by the participant.   

          In
addition, we maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for approximately 3,500 current and retired team members whose participation in our 401(k) plan is limited by
statute or regulation. These team members choose from a menu of crediting rate alternatives that are the same as the investment choices in our 401(k) plan, including Target common stock. We credit an
additional 2 percent per year to the accounts of all active participants in this plan, excluding executive officer participants, in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation
in a plan of this nature. We also maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan that was frozen during 1996, covering substantially fewer than 100 participants, most of whom are
retired. In this plan, deferred compensation earns returns tied to market levels of interest rates plus an additional 6 percent return, with a minimum of 12 percent and a maximum of
20 percent, as determined by the plan's terms. In response to changing requirements regarding the federal income tax treatment of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements resulting from
Section 409A to the Internal Revenue Code, we allowed participants to elect to accelerate the distribution dates for their account balances during 2009 and 2008. This election was not available
in 2010. Participant elections resulted in payments of $29 million in 2009 and $86 million in 2008.   

We
mitigate some of our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through investing in vehicles, including company-owned life insurance and prepaid forward contracts in our own common
stock, that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These investment vehicles are general corporate assets and are marked to market with the related gains
and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur. The total change in fair value for contracts indexed to our own common stock recognized in earnings was
pretax income/(loss) of $4 million in 2010, $36 million in 2009 and $(19) million in 2008. During 2010 and 2009, we invested approximately $41 million and
$34 million, respectively, in such investment instruments, and this activity is included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within other investing activities. Adjusting our position
in these investment vehicles may involve repurchasing shares of Target common stock when settling the forward contracts. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, these repurchases totaled 1.1 million,
1.5 million and 4.7 million shares, respectively, and are included in the total share repurchases described in Note 24.   

The settlement dates of these instruments are regularly renegotiated with the counterparty.   

(a)       Includes market-performance credits on accumulated participant account balances and annual crediting for additional benefits earned during the year.
         (b)       Includes investment returns and life-insurance proceeds received from company-owned life insurance policies and other investments used to economically hedge the cost
of these plans.

27. Pension and Postretirement Health Care Plans   

          We have qualified defined benefit pension plans covering all U.S. team members who meet age and service requirements, including in
certain circumstances, date of hire. We also have unfunded nonqualified pension plans for team members with qualified plan compensation restrictions. Eligibility for, and the level of, these benefits
varies depending on team members' date of hire, length of service and/or team member compensation. Upon early retirement and prior to Medicare eligibility, team members also become eligible for
certain health care benefits if they meet minimum age and service
requirements and agree to contribute a portion of the cost. Effective January 1, 2009, our qualified defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants, with limited exceptions.   

          We
recognize that our obligations to plan participants can only be met over time through a combination of company contributions to these plans and earnings on plan assets. In light of
this concept, we elected to contribute $153 million and $252 million to our qualified plans during 2010 and 2009, respectively. This restored the qualified plans to a fully-funded status
at year-end on an ABO (Accumulated Benefit Obligation) basis.   

          During
2009, we amended our postretirement health care plan, resulting in a $46 million reduction to our recorded liability, with a corresponding increase to shareholders' equity
of $28 million, net of taxes of $18 million. The financial benefits of this amendment will be recognized through a reduction of benefit plan expense over the six years subsequent to the
amendment.   

          The
following tables provide a summary of the changes in the benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position for our postretirement benefit plans:

Assumptions     

          Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of the measurement date were as follows:   

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit expense for each fiscal year were as follows:   

(a)       Due to the remeasurement from the plan amendment in the third quarter of 2009, the discount rate was decreased from 6.50 percent to 4.85 percent.      

The discount rate used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year is the rate as of the beginning of the year
(   e.g   ., the prior measurement date). With an essentially stable asset allocation over the following time periods,   

  60  

Table of Contents   

our
most recent annualized rate of return on qualified plans' assets has averaged 5.9 percent, 6.1 percent and 8.6 percent for the 5-year, 10-year and
15-year periods, respectively.   

          The
expected Market-Related Value of Assets (MRV) is determined each year by adjusting the previous year's value by expected return, benefit payments and cash contributions. The expected
MRV is adjusted for asset gains and losses in equal 20 percent adjustments over a five-year period.   

          Our
expected annualized long-term rate of return assumptions as of January 29, 2011 were 8.5 percent for domestic and international equity securities,
5.5 percent for long-duration debt securities, 8.5 percent for balanced funds and 10.0 percent for other investments. Balanced funds primarily invest in equities,
nominal and inflation-linked fixed income securities, commodities and public real estate. They seek to generate capital market returns while reducing market risk by investing globally in highly
diversified portfolios of public securities. These estimates are a judgmental matter in which we consider the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment
performance and current market conditions. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in
our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long-term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets.   

          An
increase in the cost of covered health care benefits of 7.5 percent was assumed for 2010 and is assumed for 2011. The rate will be reduced to 5.0 percent in 2019 and
thereafter.

Plan Assets     

          Our asset allocation policy is designed to reduce the long-term cost of funding our pension obligations. The plan invests
with both passive and active investment managers depending on the investment's asset class. The plan also seeks to reduce the risk associated with adverse movements in interest rates by employing an
interest rate hedging program, which may include the use of interest rate swaps, total return swaps and other instruments.   

(a)       Equity securities include our common stock in amounts substantially less than 1 percent of total plan assets as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010.
      (b)       Other assets include private equity, mezzanine and high-yield debt, natural resources and timberland funds, multi-strategy hedge funds, derivative instruments, and a
3 percent allocation to real estate.

Table of Contents   

(a)       Passively managed index funds with holdings in domestic and international equities.        (b)       Investments in U.S. small-,

(d)       Investments in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and passively managed index funds with holdings in long-term corporate bonds.

Position    
     
   Valuation Technique    

Cash and cash equivalents  
     
  These investments are cash holdings and investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV for the investment vehicles is based on the value of the underlying
assets owned by the fund minus applicable costs and liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.  

Equity securities  
      
   Valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.  

Common collective trusts/balanced funds/certain multi-strategy hedge funds  
      
   Valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted transactional price for participants in the fund, which do not represent an active market.  

Fixed income and government securities  
      
   Valued using matrix pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.  

Private equity/real estate/certain multi-strategy hedge funds/other  
      
   Valued by deriving Target's proportionate share of equity investment from audited financial statements. Private equity and real estate investments require significant judgment on the part of the fund manager due to
the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such investments. Certain multi-strategy hedge funds represent funds of funds that include liquidity restrictions and for which timely valuation information
is not available.  

Contributions     

          In 2010 and 2009, we made discretionary contributions of $153 million and $252 million, respectively, to our qualified
defined benefit pension plans. Even though we are not required to make any contributions, we may elect to make contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan funded status in
2011. We expect to make contributions in the range of $10 million to $15 million to our postretirement health care benefit plan in 2011.   

    Estimated Future Benefit Payments     

          Benefit payments by the plans, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

28. Segment Reporting     

          Our measure of profit for each segment is a measure that management considers analytically useful in measuring the return we are
achieving on our investment.   

(a)       The combination of bad debt expense and operations and marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment represent credit card expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
      (b)       Loyalty Program discounts are recorded as reductions to sales in our Retail Segment. Effective with the October 2010 nationwide launch of our new 5% REDcard Rewards loyalty
program,
we changed the formula under which our Credit Card segment reimburses our Retail Segment to better align with the attributes of the new program. These reimbursed amounts were $102 million in
2010, $89 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. In all periods these amounts were recorded as reductions to SG A expenses within the Retail Segment and increases to operations and
marketing expenses within the Credit Card Segment.      

   Note: The sum of the segment amounts may not equal the total amounts due to rounding.   

Substantially all of our revenues are generated and long-lived assets are located within the United States.   

29. Quarterly Results (Unaudited)     

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, fourth quarter operating results typically represent a substantially larger share of total
year revenues and earnings because they include our peak sales period from Thanksgiving   

  64

through
the end of December. We follow the same accounting policies for preparing quarterly and annual financial data. The table below summarizes quarterly results for 2010 and 2009:   

Note: Per share amounts are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the quarters may not
equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes in average quarterly shares outstanding and all other quarterly amounts may not equal the total year due to rounding.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures            

          As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the
participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

          There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Target Canada shall have the right to take assignments of one or more First Tranche Subject Leases on one or more dates (each, a   Delivery Date  ) after the First Tranche Closing Date, provided (i) Zellers and Target Canada shall reasonably cooperate in executing, on the applicable Delivery Date, all documents and instruments contemplated under this Agreement to be delivered on a Closing Date, (ii) all such documents, when delivered, shall provide the Parties with all rights and obligations with respect to each Subject Leased Property that the Parties would have had if such documents and instruments had been delivered on the First Tranche Closing Date, (iii) such documents shall in all events be executed and delivered by the Parties on the earlier of (a) a date selected by Target Canada on at least 10 days advance written notice from Target Canada, and (b) the Second Tranche Closing Date, and (iv) no Delivery Date shall be within 10 Business Days of the Second Tranche Closing Date.  
     
   Section 2.2                                           Second Tranche Subject Leased Properties.   
     
  (1)                                     From time to time during the Second Tranche Selection Period, Target or Target Canada shall deliver to Zellers a written notice designating additional Leases that shall be assigned and transferred on the Second Tranche Closing Date (such list, as updated from time to time, the   Second Tranche Selection List  ), provided that the number of Leases designated on the Second Tranche Selection List when added to the number of Leases designated on the First Tranche Selection List shall not be more than 220.  
     
  12    

(2)                                     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Zellers agrees to assign and transfer to Target Canada or at the direction of Target Canada to a Designee and Target Canada agrees to acquire and assume or cause to be acquired and assumed by a Designee on the Second Tranche Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time of the Second Tranche Closing Date, the Second Tranche Subject Leases, including all rights of Zellers relating thereto or arising thereunder (inclusive of any options of Zellers therein).  On or before the Second Tranche Closing Date:  
     
  (i)                                         each of Zellers and Target Canada shall enter into a Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to those Second Tranche Subject Leases to be assigned to Target Canada; and  
     
  (ii)                                      Zellers shall, and Target Canada shall cause its Designees to, enter into a Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to those Second Tranche Subject Leases to be assigned to a Designee;  
     
  in respect of each of the Second Tranche Subject Leases to effect the aforesaid assignment, transfer and assumption thereof.  
     
  (3)                                     Contemporaneous with the assignment and transfer of the Second Tranche Subject Leases, each of Zellers and Target Canada shall enter into (or Target Canada shall cause its Designee to enter into) Subleases in respect of each of the Second Tranche Subject Leased Properties the terms of which will commence as of the Effective Time of the Second Tranche Closing Date.  
     
   Section 2.3                                           Right to Terminate Leases.   
     
  Instead of taking an assignment of any Subject Lease (or directing the assignment of such Subject Lease to a Designee) on the applicable Closing Date, Target Canada may negotiate with the applicable Landlord for the termination of such Subject Lease, provided that (i) no such termination shall be effective prior to the applicable Closing Date with respect to such Subject Lease; (ii) from and after the applicable Closing Date to and including the applicable Vacancy Date, Zellers shall have the same right to use and occupy the Subject Leased Property relating to such Subject Lease under a Sublease (or other agreement providing substantially similar rights) on all the same terms and conditions that would have applied had such Subject Lease been assigned to Target Canada (instead of terminated) and subleased to Zellers under a Sublease, except that all amounts that would have been paid as rent under such Sublease shall be paid to the Landlord, or as Target Canada may direct; (iii) such Subject Lease shall count as one of the Leases that Target Canada is entitled to designate under Section 2.1(1) or 2.2(1), notwithstanding Target Canada s election to arrange for the termination (rather than assignment) of such Subject Lease; and (iv) the Vacancy Date for such Subject Leased Property shall be established by Target Canada giving a Notice in accordance with Section 2.4.  
     
   Section 2.4                                           Vacancy Date.   
     
  (1)                                     Target Canada, Target or a Designee may from time to time provide Notice to Zellers establishing the Vacancy Date for one or more Subleases.  
     
  13    

(2)                                     On each Vacancy Date, effective as of the applicable Effective Time, the Sublease(s) identified in the Notice shall be terminated and Target Canada or a Designee shall accept and take possession of the relevant Subject Leased Properties, which Subject Leased Properties shall be (i) empty of all inventory, trade fixtures (including all store shelving, racks, display cases and stockroom shelving systems), personal property and debris, and (ii) free from any subtenants, licensees or other Persons in possession of all or any portion of the relevant Subject Leased Properties.    Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the Subject Leases or any Ancillary Agreement, Zellers shall have no obligation (a) to restore the Subject Leased Properties to a base building condition or standard, (b) to remove any leasehold improvements from the Subject Leased Properties, or (c) to repair, patch or replace any walls, ceilings or flooring damaged by the removal of trade fixtures, provided such removal is accomplished in a commercially reasonable manner.  
     
   Section 2.5                                           Ordinary Course Operations.   
     
  From the Execution Date until the expiration of the Second Tranche Selection Period, Zellers shall operate and cause to be operated the operations currently conducted by it and its Affiliates, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its licensees and subtenants to operate the operations currently operated by each of them, in and on the Leased Properties in the ordinary course of Zellers  business and consistent with Zellers  and Zellers  Affiliates , licensees  and subtenants  past practices (including maintaining and updating all Pharmacy Records in accordance with customary practices of the applicable pharmacy operator or required by Laws), Laws and in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Leases (including, with respect to any Lease as to which there exists a dispute or default that is disclosed in Section 5.1(i)(iii), 5.1(i)(vii) or 5.1(i)(viii) of the Disclosure Letter, using commercially reasonable efforts to resolve or cure such dispute or default), in each case in all material respects.  As to the Subject Leases and the Subject Leased Properties only, from the expiration of the Second Tranche Selection Period until the applicable Vacancy Date, Zellers shall operate and cause to be operated the operations currently conducted by it and its Affiliates, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its pharmacy licensees and subtenants to operate the operations currently operated by each of them, in and on the Subject Leased Properties in the ordinary course of Zellers  business and consistent with Zellers  and Zellers  Affiliates , pharmacy licensees  and subtenants  past practices (including maintaining and updating all Pharmacy Records in accordance with customary practices of the applicable pharmacy operator or required by Laws), Laws and in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Subleases, in each case in all material respects.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in this Section 2.5 will derogate from Zellers  rights contained in the Subleases or in Section 2.4 during the applicable portion of the time period during the conduct of the Wind-Down Actions, nor shall the exercise of such rights constitute a breach of this Section 2.5, (ii) the Wind-Down Actions shall not constitute a breach of this Section 2.5, provided such actions are taken in accordance with the terms of the respective Sublease and all Laws, (iii) the period during which liquidation sales may be conducted (as established pursuant to the definition of Wind-Down Actions) shall not be limited as described in such definition with respect to any Subject Leased Property as to which the conduct of a liquidation sale for such extended period will not and does not (a) give rise to a Landlord Recapture Right, (b) give rise to a Lease Default; or (c) diminish or limit any right or privilege of the tenant under the applicable Subject Lease, and (iv) Zellers has the right to terminate any sublease, license, concession or other occupancy agreement relating to the Leased  
     
  14    

Property at any time following the applicable Closing Date, excluding any pharmacy sublease, license, concession or other occupancy agreement.  
     
   Section 2.6                                           Pharmacy Records.   
     
  At the option of Target Canada, which may be exercised by Notice given by Target Canada to Zellers from time to time no later than 90 days prior to the applicable Vacancy Date (the   Pharmacy Notice Date  ), but subject to Laws, Zellers shall and shall cause its Affiliates and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third-party operator of the pharmacy in the applicable Subject Leased Property to transfer to or upon the direction of Target Canada all or any portion of the Pharmacy Records specified in such Notice (to the extent a pharmacy is operating in the applicable Subject Leased Property), including paper file backup and a backup tape for all prescriptions (to the extent such exist), without retaining any copies of such Pharmacy Records other than such copies as Zellers or applicable pharmacy operator is required to retain by Laws (and, in such case, only to the extent and for so long as required by Laws). No additional consideration shall be payable by Target or Target Canada in connection with such transfer of Pharmacy Records.  Zellers shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable pharmacy operator to, make such transfer in respect of each applicable Subject Leased Property (i) in a format reasonably requested by Target Canada, (ii) free and clear of all Encumbrances, (iii) on the applicable Vacancy Date (or such earlier date as is specified in such Notice, which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date such Notice is given) in respect of such Subject Leased Property provided Target Canada has provided appropriate notice by the applicable Pharmacy Notice Date, and (iv) if requested by Target Canada, pursuant to a mutually agreed upon file transfer agreement with terms consistent with those set forth in this Section 2.6.  The Parties shall cooperate to effect any such transfers in accordance with Laws.  Neither Zellers nor any of its Affiliates will directly or indirectly solicit the transfer of any of the Pharmacy Records that may be transferred to or upon the direction of Target Canada pursuant to this Agreement to any stores or pharmacies operated by Zellers or any of its Affiliates or, subject to Laws, provide to any other Person any of the Pharmacy Records that are to be transferred to or upon the direction of Target Canada pursuant to this Agreement.  Zellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any contractual rights it may have with the third-party operator of a pharmacy in each applicable Subject Leased Property restricting the solicitation or transfer of any of the Pharmacy Records that are to be transferred to or upon the direction of Target Canada pursuant to this Agreement where Zellers has knowledge of any actual or threatened breach of such provisions. For purposes of this Section 2.6 only, knowledge of Zellers shall include the actual knowledge of the General Merchandise Manager, Pharmacy of Zellers.  
     
   Section 2.7                                           Target Canada Assignment of Rights.   
     
  (1)                                     Target Canada may from time to time designate one or more Persons (each, a   Designee  ) to be an immediate or subsequent assignee(s) of the Subject Leases, as follows:  
     
  (a)                                     If Target Canada wishes to have one or more Subject Leases assigned directly by Zellers to one or more Designee(s), Target Canada may upon at least 10 Business Days  written notice in advance of a Delivery Date or a Closing Date, as the case may be, identify the Designee(s) that is or are to be the assignee(s) of the Subject  
     
  15    

Leases to be assigned and transferred by Zellers on the applicable Closing Date or Delivery Date, in which case, on such date, with respect to the Subject Lease(s) so identified:  
     
  (i)                                         the Designee(s) will execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption of Lease Agreement in substantially the form specified in Section 2.7(1) of the Disclosure Letter (as such form may be modified in accordance with Section 2.7(5) of this Agreement, a   Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement  ) (and Zellers and   Target Canada will not   execute a Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreement) with respect to such Subject Leases(s), and  
     
  (ii)                                      such Designee(s) (and not Target Canada) will execute and deliver the Sublease(s) in favour of Zellers with respect to the applicable Subject Leased Properties.  
     
  Zellers need not make any assignment directly to a Designee unless such Designee executes and delivers a Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement on the applicable Closing Date or Delivery Date.  If any Designee shall fail or refuse to execute and deliver a Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Sublease with respect to any Subject Lease, Target Canada and Zellers shall, upon Target Canada s request, enter into a Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreement and a corresponding Sublease in respect of the applicable Subject Lease on the Closing Date or Delivery Date.  
     
  (b)                                     If Target Canada wishes to assign to one or more Designee(s) one or more Subject Lease(s) previously assigned to Target Canada, Target Canada may at any time and from time to time do so without limit or qualification of any kind, except that any such   assignment by Target Canada shall be subject to the rights of Zellers under any applicable Sublease then in effect.  
     
  (2)                                     In connection with the assignment of any Subject Lease(s) to any Designee(s) pursuant to Section 2.7(1), Target Canada and/or Target may by separate agreement with such Designee(s) provide representations and warranties in such form and content as Target Canada and/or Target may elect.  Zellers shall have no direct liability or obligation to any Designee on account of any such representations or warranties.  The assignment of a Subject Lease(s) to Designee(s) does not relieve Zellers of liability for a breach of any of the representations or warranties contained in Section 5.1 to the extent that such breach results in Damages to Target Canada or Target, subject, in all events, to the limitations contained in this Agreement, including Section 11.5.  
     
  (3)                                     Upon assignment of a Subject Lease (whether by Zellers pursuant to Section 2.7(1)(a) or by Target Canada pursuant to Section 2.7(1)(b)) to an Investment Grade Designee at any time up to the second anniversary of the applicable Vacancy Date for such Subject Lease, Target Canada                and Target shall be released from all Subject Lease Obligations relating to such Subject Lease, to the extent, and only to the extent, (i) assumed by such Investment Grade Designee and (ii) an indemnity has been provided by such Designee with respect to such Subject Lease Obligation assumed by such Designee, in each case, in writing.  Such assumption and indemnity by an Investment Grade Designee may be accomplished:  
     
  16    

(a)                                     in the case of an assignment pursuant to Section 2.7(1)(a), pursuant to   a Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement,   or pursuant to   an assumption and indemnity agreement by the Investment Grade Designee in favour of Zellers in a form which is acceptable to Zellers, acting reasonably; or  
     
  (b)                                     in the case of an assignment by Target Canada pursuant to Section 2.7(1)(b), pursuant to an assumption   and indemnity   agreement by the Investment Grade Designee in favour of Zellers in a form which is acceptable to Zellers, acting reasonably.  If pursuant to an instrument of assignment between Target Canada and a Designee, such Designee (i) assumes some or all Subject Lease Obligations with respect to a Subject Lease, and (ii) confirms in writing with Zellers that such assumption   and indemnity   runs in favour of Zellers, then Zellers shall join in (by attached joinder or otherwise) such instrument in order to (x) accept such assumption and (y) confirm the release of Target and Target Canada to the extent of the Subject Lease Obligations so assumed and indemnified.  
     
  Any release provided for in this Section 2.7(a)(3) shall be effective upon the execution by the Investment Grade Designee and receipt by Zellers of the aforesaid Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement or other assumption   and indemnity   agreement, and shall require no further act, deed or writing.  Zellers agrees from time to time upon request of Target or Target Canada to confirm such releases, but the failure of Target or Target Canada to request any such confirmation, and the failure of Zellers to provide any such confirmation, shall not affect the automatic release provided in the preceding sentence.  For purposes hereof,   Subject Lease Obligations   means all obligations arising under (i) a Subject Lease assigned to a Designee, (ii) the Lease Assignment and Assumption Agreement or Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement, as applicable, pursuant to which such Subject Lease was assigned, (iii) the Sublease entered into or to be entered into with respect to such Subject Lease, and (iv) Sections 11.3(d) and 11.3(e) with respect to such Subject Lease.  
     
  (4)                                     No assignment of a Subject Lease to a Designee that is not an Investment Grade Designee at the time of assignment shall release Target Canada or Target from any Subject Lease Obligations.  
     
  (5)                                     The form of Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement may be varied and modified by Target Canada in its discretion from time to time so long as such variations and modifications do not (a) expand upon any representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, or liabilities of Zellers beyond those contained in the form of Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement specified in Section 2.7(1) of the Disclosure Letter, or (b) alter in any material respect the provisions of Section 5 of the form of Designee Assignment and Assumption Agreement specified in Section 2.7(1) of the Disclosure Letter.  
     
  (6)                                     Target and Target Canada shall remain responsible for and shall not, in any event, be released from any of their covenants and obligations under this Agreement in relation to the payment of the entire Purchase Price by reason of any assignments made pursuant to this Section 2.7.  
     
  17    

Section 2.8                                           Access and Additional Information Relating to Leased Properties.   
     
  (1)                                     Subject to Target Canada complying with Laws, prior to the final Vacancy Date, Zellers shall, upon reasonable prior Notice, permit Target Canada and its representatives and advisers reasonable access to the Leased Properties during the period commencing two hours prior to the Leased Property opening for business to the public and ending two hours after the close of business, subject to the rights of all subtenants, licensees and concessionaires in the Leased Property (excluding, however, such subtenants, licensees and concessionaires that are Affiliates of Zellers) in order to make such reasonable investigations as Target Canada shall reasonably determine are necessary or advisable.  Target Canada shall perform such investigations in compliance with Laws.  Subject to Laws, and at the sole cost and expense of Target Canada, Zellers shall give Target Canada s representatives and agents reasonable means necessary to effect such investigations and shall cause its agents, employees, officers and directors to aid such representatives and agents in such investigations.  Zellers is not required to disclose any information to Target Canada where such disclosure is prohibited by Laws or by the terms of any agreement.  Any investigations or tests which require drilling or other invasive actions shall be performed outside of the hours when the Leased Property is open for business to the public and shall be done only with the prior written consent of Zellers, acting reasonably, and all such inspections and tests contemplated by this Agreement shall not unduly interfere (and Target Canada and Target shall use their reasonable commercial efforts not to so interfere) with the use, access, operation and enjoyment by Zellers and its subtenants, licensees, concessionaries, customers and suppliers of the Leased Properties.  
     
  (2)                                     Except as necessary to perform the investigations contemplated by this Section 2.8, Target Canada and Target shall not make contact with any store employees of Zellers without the prior written consent of Zellers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  
     
  (3)                                     Prior to entry onto the Leased Properties, Target Canada or Target, as applicable, shall have in effect a policy of general liability insurance with a reputable national insurance company and with coverages in accordance with normal commercial practices in Toronto, Ontario; provided, however, that such insurance may be carried under a blanket policy or pursuant to Target s self-insurance program. At Zellers  request, Target Canada or Target Canada s representatives and agents, as the case may be, shall provide evidence of such insurance or self-insurance prior to any entry onto any of the Leased Properties.  Target Canada and Target each  agree in favour of Zellers to repair forthwith any damage to the Leased Properties arising from such access or investigations (including by any Designee or potential Designee pursuant to Section 2.8(6)) at Target Canada and Target s expense and shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold Zellers harmless from and against any and all losses, Damages (including, for greater certainty, lost profits), claims, costs (including costs on a solicitor and client basis) or liabilities in respect of physical injury or property damage that may be directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by Zellers directly arising from or in respect of the access or investigations by Target Canada, Target and/or any Designee, potential Designee and each of their representatives and advisors.  
     
  18    

(4)                                     Zellers shall, within five days after receipt of a request from Target Canada or Target Canada s counsel, execute and deliver to Target Canada all consents reasonably necessary to permit Target Canada to have inspections made by and to have existing records released to Target Canada by the municipal building and zoning departments, fire departments, public works departments, environmental agencies, elevator inspections branch of the provincial or territorial departments of labour and other appropriate authorities as Target Canada may consider advisable, acting reasonably, between the Execution Date and  the Vacancy Date, respectively, for each Subject Lease.  
     
  (5)                                     From the Execution Date until the applicable Closing Date or Delivery Date, Zellers shall afford Target, Target Canada, and their respective representatives and advisers reasonable access to all Books and Records in Zellers  possession or control relating to the Leased Properties or the Leases.  
     
  (6)                                     Each Designee and each Person identified by Target Canada as a potential Designee shall have the same access and inspection rights afforded to Target Canada under this Section 2.8, on and subject to the terms, conditions and requirements of this Section 2.8, provided that such potential Designee executes and delivers in favour of Zellers an access, confidentiality and indemnification agreement in the form attached as Section 2.8(6) to the Disclosure Letter and that the covenants and indemnity of Target and Target Canada in favour of Zellers and set out in Section 2.8(3) shall equally apply in respect of the examinations, investigations and testing undertaken by any Designee or any Person designated as a potential Designee.  For greater certainty, nothing in this Section will in any way limit the indemnification obligations of Target and Target Canada in favour of Zellers under Section 2.8(3).  
     
   Section 2.9                                           Winnipeg Lease Option.   
     
  Target Canada has the option to enter into an agreement with HBC to lease the Winnipeg Premises, which agreement will be based on the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.9 to the Disclosure Letter.  If Target Canada and HBC have not executed such lease by the Second Tranche Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall increase by $12,500,000, which additional $12,500,000 shall be payable on the Second Tranche Closing Date.

  (2)                                     On the Second Tranche Closing Date, the Second Tranche Purchase Price will be paid and satisfied, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.3, as follows:  
     
  (a)                                     as to the Cost Basis of the Notes transferred and assigned to or on the direction of Zellers on the Second Tranche Closing Date pursuant to Section 3.8(5), if any, plus any Accrued Interest on such Notes that has not been paid to Target Canada, by such transfer of such Notes; and

  (3)                                     For purposes of this Section 3.2, the conversion of the Cost Basis of any Note to be transferred and assigned, together with the Accrued Interest thereon, from United States dollars to Canadian dollars shall be determined by reference to the applicable exchange rate, as reported by Bloomberg as of noon (Eastern Time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Note was acquired by Target or Target Canada.  
     
   Section 3.3                                           Adjustments.   
     
  (1)                                    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.3 and subject to the rights and obligations of Zellers and Target Canada under the Subleases, all adjustments for basic rent, additional rents, damage/security deposits paid or payable to Landlords and interest thereon, if any, prepaid rents and interest thereon, if any, and operating expenses, utilities  
     
  20    

and realty taxes, payable or receivable under the Subject Leases, shall be made as of the relevant Vacancy Date (with all expenses, liabilities and revenues for the Vacancy Date being allocated to Zellers) and shall be paid on the relevant Vacancy Date pursuant to a statement of adjustments in respect of the relevant Leased Property to be prepared by Zellers and approved by Target Canada, each acting reasonably, at least 10 days prior to the relevant Vacancy Date (a      Statement of Adjustments  ).  
     
  (2)                                      If the final cost or amount of any item which is to be adjusted cannot be determined at the relevant Vacancy Date, then (unless otherwise provided in this Section 3.3) an initial adjustment for such item shall be made at the relevant Vacancy Date, such amount to be estimated by Zellers, acting reasonably, as of the relevant Vacancy Date on the basis of the best evidence available at such Vacancy Date as to what the final cost or amount of such item will be.  Additional rents and operating cost adjustments to be determined by a Landlord following a fiscal or calendar year end shall not be adjusted until such determination.  All amounts which have been estimated because they have not been finally determined by the relevant Vacancy Date shall be finally adjusted in accordance with this Section 3.3(2) (such final adjustments being the      Post-Vacancy Adjustments  ).  In each case when such cost or amount is determined, Zellers or Target Canada, as the case may be, shall within 30 days thereafter provide a complete statement of such final determination to the other and within 30 days after such 30-day period (or if there is a dispute over such amount, after the matter is determined by the Auditor pursuant to this Section) the necessary Post-Vacancy Adjustment shall be made. In the case of any dispute between the Parties with respect to any Post-Vacancy Adjustments, the final cost or amount of an item shall be determined by a national audit firm (the   Auditor  ) appointed jointly by Zellers and Target Canada within 10 Business Days after the issue is referred by one of the Parties to the Auditor for such determination.  The cost of such determination shall be shared equally between the relevant Parties.  Zellers and Target Canada agree to execute and deliver on the relevant Vacancy Date an undertaking to re-adjust and pay the amount of any Post-Vacancy Adjustments as may be owing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.3, save and except for those Post-Vacancy Adjustments being determined by the Auditor in the manner set out herein (the   Audited Claim  ), all adjustments and Post-Vacancy Adjustments to be made pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall, in any event, be completed on or before the date which is no later than the second anniversary of the relevant Vacancy Date (the   Final Adjustment Date  ) and no claim for any re-adjustment may be made by either party thereafter, unless and only to the extent such claim is an Audited Claim or is an adjustment pursuant to Section 3.3(3) or Section 3.5.  Subject to the terms of the applicable Sublease, Zellers shall, without delay, be responsible to conclude all final reconciliations of all sums payable or receivable by the tenant under the Subject Leases in accordance with the terms of each Subject Lease and Target Canada shall provide such assistance as may be reasonably required.  Subject to the terms of the applicable Sublease, Zellers and Target Canada agree that Target Canada shall not be responsible for any percentage rents attributable to Zellers  sales, special service costs (such as additional janitorial services, additional HVAC supplied) and other costs for special services provided at the request of Zellers to a standard higher than the norm called for by the terms of the relevant Lease, or penalties and interest charged by the Landlord in respect of amounts owing which are attributable to the period prior to the Vacancy Date.  
     
  21    

(3)                                      Zellers shall be entitled after the Vacancy Date to any amounts payable to Zellers and responsible for any amounts owing by Zellers, pursuant to, or in respect of any agreements with Governmental Entities or any owners of property adjoining the Leased Properties or under or in respect of the Subject Leases or the Leased Properties whereby any other Person is required to pay, reimburse, refund or otherwise contribute any amount to Zellers in respect of any improvements, work, services or costs that have been supplied, constructed, installed, performed or paid by Zellers prior to the relevant Vacancy Date (in each case, a   Prepaid Cost Refund  ) or whereby any other Person is entitled to be paid any such similar amount by Zellers.  This obligation survives the relevant Vacancy Date and the Final Adjustment Date, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.  To the extent Target Canada receives any Prepaid Cost Refund, Target Canada shall hold such Prepaid Cost Refund in trust for Zellers and shall endorse in favour of Zellers and deliver to Zellers the Prepaid Cost Refund forthwith upon receipt.  Nothing in this Agreement, the Subject Leases or the Ancillary Agreements, shall preclude Zellers from commencing or maintaining an action against a third party from whom Zellers is entitled to receive a Prepaid Cost Refund. Any such amount payable by Zellers shall be paid within 10 days following a request for payment from Target Canada or the applicable recipient.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zellers may, upon prior consultation with Target Canada, deal directly with a Landlord following the applicable Closing Date in connection with all claims and disputes (including reconciliation of all payments and charges thereunder) between the Landlord and Zellers with respect to the Leased Property arising prior to the applicable Closing Date; provided, however, such actions shall in no event adversely impact Target Canada s rights or obligations under the Subject Lease.  
     
   Section 3.4                                           Sales and Transfer Taxes.   
     
  Target Canada or the applicable Designee or Designees shall be liable for and pay all sales and transfer taxes (including land transfer taxes), registration charges and transfer fees payable (i) by the assignee in respect of the assignment of the Subject Leases from Zellers to Target Canada or a Designee or Designees and (ii) in connection with any transfer of Pharmacy Records.  Zellers and Target Canada shall each be liable for and shall pay 50% of any sales and transfer taxes (including land transfer taxes), registration charges and transfer fees payable in connection with the registration of any of the Subject Leases and any transfer thereof occurring prior to the applicable Closing Date (to the extent that Target Canada or Target has requested such registration by reason of such registration being reasonably required in order for Target Canada or a Designee to register the assignment to Target Canada or such Designee or obtain title insurance or a title opinion reasonably satisfactory to Target Canada or such Designee).  Zellers shall provide such assistance and execute such documents as Target Canada may reasonably require to complete such registrations.  
     
   Section 3.5                                           Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax.   
     
  Subject to Section 3.6, Target Canada shall be liable for and shall pay, or shall cause the applicable Designee or Designees to be liable for and pay, to Zellers an amount equal to any goods and services tax and harmonized sales tax payable by Target Canada and collectible by Zellers under the  Excise Tax Act  (Canada), plus an amount equal to any similar value added or multi-staged tax imposed (including, for greater certainty, any applicable Quebec Sales Tax) by any applicable provincial or territorial legislation, in respect of the assignment of the Subject  
     
  22    

Leases to Target Canada or the Designee or Designees.  Any such taxes shall be paid to Zellers no later than three Business Days before such taxes, if any, are due to be remitted by Zellers.  
     
   Section 3.6                                           Self-Assessment of GST and HST on Real Property.   
     
  To the extent permitted under subsection 221(2) of the  Excise Tax Act  (Canada) and any equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or territorial legislation and provided that Target Canada delivers or causes to be delivered by the applicable Designee or Designees on the Closing Date to Zellers the HST Declaration and Indemnity, Target Canada or the applicable Designee or Designees shall self-assess and remit, where applicable, directly to the appropriate Governmental Entity any goods and services tax and harmonized sales tax imposed under the  Excise Tax Act  (Canada) and any similar value added or multi-staged tax imposed by any applicable provincial or territorial legislation payable in connection with the assignment of the Subject Leases under this Agreement.  Target Canada or the applicable Designee or Designees shall make and file any returns in accordance with the requirements of subsection 228(4) of the  Excise Tax Act  (Canada) and any equivalent or corresponding provision under any applicable provincial or territorial legislation.  
     
   Section 3.7                                           Tax Refunds.   
     
  In the event that there are any realty tax appeals in respect of any Subject Leased Property for any tax year prior to and including the year in which the applicable Vacancy Date for such Subject Leased Property occurs (but not any subsequent tax year), Zellers may, at its option, at no cost to Target Canada, and provided that it does not and will not materially and adversely affect future assessments, continue such appeals (or, at Zellers  election, require Target Canada to pursue such appeals in good faith at Zellers  expense, and without Target Canada being required to incur any liabilities or obligations) and shall be entitled to receive any rebate, refund, credit, reassessment, readjustment, payment and/or the like from time to time (the full amounts of each being a   Tax Refund  ) resulting therefrom to the extent relating to the period prior to the applicable Vacancy Date; provided that Zellers shall consult with Target Canada (or Target Canada with Zellers as the case may be) with respect to, and Target Canada (or Zellers as the case may be) acting reasonably shall have the right to approve, any final settlement or disposition of any such appeal (such approval shall be deemed to have been given by Target Canada (or Zellers as the case may be) if Target Canada (or Zellers as the case may be) has not responded within 15 Business Days of a request by Zellers (or Target Canada as the case may be) for such approval). Each of Target Canada and Zellers agrees to co-operate with the other with respect to all such appeals or reassessments and to provide the other with access to any necessary documents or materials required to continue any such appeals or reassessments.  Target Canada shall cooperate with Zellers as to any tax appeals and shall, if requested to do so, execute such applications, authorizations or other documents as may be necessary for Zellers to undertake  and pursue the appeal.  To the extent Target Canada receives any Tax Refund in respect of the period prior to the applicable Vacancy Date, Target Canada shall hold such Tax Refund in trust for Zellers and shall endorse in favour of Zellers and deliver to Zellers the Tax Refund promptly upon receipt; provided that, in all cases, readjustments with the Landlords under the Subject Leases as the result of any Tax Refund may be effected by Target Canada prior to the payment of any Tax Refund to Zellers and the amount otherwise owing to Zellers in accordance with the foregoing shall be reduced by any amount payable to any Landlord as a result of any such adjustments (it being agreed that Target Canada shall provide Zellers with copies of any written communication with the Landlord in respect of the foregoing).  Similarly, to the extent Zellers  
     
  23    

receives any Tax Refund for the period following the relevant Vacancy Date, Zellers shall hold such Tax Refund in trust for Target Canada and shall endorse in favour of Target Canada and deliver to Target Canada the Tax Refund forthwith upon receipt.  If Target Canada sells or otherwise disposes of its interest in the Subject Lease to any Person (including to any Designee), it shall obtain a covenant from such Person in favour of Zellers in which such Person agrees to observe and be bound by the terms of this Section.

  (3)                                      Any interest accruing on any Notes from the time of acquisition of such Notes pursuant to this Section 3.8 to the applicable Closing Date upon which such Notes are transferred in accordance with Section 3.2 (the   Accrued Interest  ) shall accrue to the benefit of Target, Target Canada or the applicable Affiliates, as the case may be.  Any interest that is paid to Target, Target Canada or any such Affiliate on the Notes shall be retained by them.  
     
  (4)                                      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the First Tranche Closing Date Target Canada shall transfer and assign or cause to be transferred and assigned to or at the direction of Zellers all right, title and interest of Target, Target Canada and such Affiliates, as the case may be, in and to any and all Notes acquired pursuant to this Section 3.8 prior to such time.

  (1)                                     From and after the Execution Date to and including the Second Tranche Closing Date Zellers will not amend, modify, consent to, grant any approval or take any action, or omit to take any action, under or with respect to any Lease (other than the enforcement of rights under or with respect to any Lease), without the prior written consent of Target Canada,   provided (i) if the action taken with respect to the Lease in question is required to allow the continued operation of the   Zellers   store, then Target Canada s consent may not be unreasonably conditioned or withheld, and (ii) if the immediately preceding clause (i) does not apply, then Target Canada may provide, condition or withhold such consent in its sole and absolute discretion  . For the purposes of each of the foregoing matters referred to in this Section 7.6(1) in respect of any Lease and/or any other matter relating to the operation and administration of any Leased Property prior to the Second Tranche Closing Date that require Target Canada s consent or approval (each a   Consent Matter  ), Zellers, through Brian Pall or Bruce Moore (each an   Authorized Zellers Representative  ), may make requests from time to time for Target Canada s consent or approval with respect to any Consent Matter directly to Joan Ahrens (the   Authorized Target Representative  ).  For the purposes of this Agreement, any consent or approval with respect to any Consent Matter given by the Authorized Target Representative to an Authorized Zellers Representative from time to time, by email or other form of written communication (which email or other communication shall clearly reference this Section 7.6), shall constitute written consent of Target Canada for all purposes with respect to such Consent Matter.  
     
  (2)                                     Section 7.6(2) of the Disclosure Letter lists each Lease (if any) that requires   Zellers to deliver notice or otherwise take steps in order to extend or renew the term of such Lease after the Execution Date and prior to December 31, 2011, and the last date (the   Renewal Notice Expiration Date  ) by which such notice must be given or such steps taken.  Target Canada shall elect by Notice given to Zellers no later than 30 days (or 14 days, with respect to Leases with a Renewal Notice Expiration Date prior to February 28, 2011) prior to the Renewal Notice Expiration Date as to whether the Lease is a Subject Lease and if so, whether Target Canada wishes to have the term extended or renewed.    Failing delivery of Target Canada s Notice as aforesaid, Zellers may elect whether or not to renew or extend such Lease in its discretion, and in no event will Zellers have any liability to Target or Target Canada if such Notice is not delivered.  
     
  (3)                                     From and after the Execution Date, to and including the Second Tranche Closing Date, Zellers will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Target Canada (a) a copy of each Default Notice relating to the Leased Properties within two Business Days of receipt by Zellers or any Affiliate of Zellers of such Default Notice, and (b) a copy of each notice of default or claimed default sent by Zellers to any Landlord within two Business Days of the date any such notice is sent.

  (1)                                      Zellers, HBC and their Affiliates (each, a   Zellers Entity  ) currently own, lease, ground lease or hold other similar interests in one or more of the developments in which a Subject Leased Property was or is located (each, a   Subject Development  ).  
     
  (2)                                      Zellers and HBC, on behalf of each Zellers                    Entity, agree to fully cooperate, subject to the allocation of costs set out in Section 7.7(2)(h), in order to allow Target Canada, Target, any Designee permitted under Section 2.7 and any of their respective Affiliates (each, a   Target Entity  ), to enter, operate, develop, remodel and/or redevelop each Subject Development for any uses which are consistent with a first class retail shopping centre in Canada, including a Target discount department store (which store may include, pharmacy, restaurant and food sales operations without restriction as to product types or size of areas devoted to such items) as is typically operated, from time to time, in the United States or Canada (the   Permitted Use  ).  Zellers and HBC will cause each Zellers Entity on its own behalf and on behalf of those claiming, by, through and under such Zellers Entity, with respect to a Subject Development only:  
     
  (a)                                      to modify, waive, release and terminate all use restrictions and use exclusives benefiting or enforceable by the Zellers Entity that would limit or prohibit the operation of any Permitted Use by a Target Entity.  
     
  (b)                                     to consent to the temporary reduction, cessation or reasonable modification of operations of the Target Entity at any Subject Leased Property so as to allow for the remodelling, development or redevelopment of such Subject Leased Property which consent shall be given without such Zellers Entity availing itself of any rights in connection with such consent, including a reduction of rent, right to cease operations, right of termination or any other similar provision, if such consent relates to any Subject Development;  
     
  (c)                                      to grant all consents and approvals for the remodelling, developing or redeveloping the interior of any building (provided that any change to the location or size of such building shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7.7(2)(e)) located or to be located on or within a Subject Development;  
     
  (d)                                     to grant all consents and approvals for the remodelling, developing or redeveloping the exterior elevations of any building (including building signage, branding, architectural details and closure of entrances to the Target Entity s building) located or to be located on or within a Subject Development (provided that any change to the location or size of such building shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7.7(2)(e)), as well as any appurtenances immediately adjacent to the Target Entity s building (e.g., sidewalks, landscaping and loading docks), but not other common areas;  
     
  (e)                                      to grant all consents and approvals for remodelling, developing or redeveloping any Subject Development (including the relocation or any change in the size of any building) and any freestanding signage; provided however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Zellers Entities shall have no obligation under this Section 7.7(2)(e) to (i) incur any Damages, liability, costs or expenses from a  
     
  38    

third party claim (other than those contemplated to be incurred by a Zellers Entity pursuant to Section 7.7(2)(h)); (ii) take or to refrain from taking any action, or to consent, approve, support or withhold objection to any matter or thing, which would or could reasonably be expected to result in Damages, liability, costs or expenses to any Zellers Entity from a third party claim (other than those contemplated to be incurred by a Zellers Entity pursuant to Section 7.7(2)(h)), in connection with the breach of any Laws or any Encumbrances existing as of the Execution Date by or to which a Zellers Entity is a party or to which it is subject, or which affects a Subject Development; or (iii) take or to refrain from taking any action, or to consent, approve, support or withhold objection to any matter or thing which would, or could reasonably be expected to, materially adversely affect the use, operation, signage, parking rights in any  primary parking field , access to common areas, full pedestrian and vehicular access to all existing internal and external roadways and walkways of any Bay store or the business conducted therein (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) are collectively, the   Approval Restrictions  ).  If any Approval Restrictions do exist under item (ii) above, each Zellers Entity will use its commercially reasonable efforts (without payment of consideration or repayment of debt) to (a) obtain the consent from any Person benefiting from such Approval Restriction and/or (b) allow for the requested co-operation of the Zellers Entity to be given in accordance with this Section 7.7;  
     
  (f)                                        to join in applications for all permits, variances, special uses, licenses or authorizations deemed necessary or desirable by the Target Entity in connection with remodelling, development or redevelopment of the Subject Leased Property for the foregoing purposes, and to the extent such request is in compliance with Section 7.7(2)(e), the balance of any Subject Development; provided however, that no Zellers Entity shall have any obligation to join in any of the foregoing to the extent that such item would expose such Zellers Entity to Damages, liability, costs or expenses except to the extent the foregoing relate to the Zellers Entity s authority to issue such authorization or the Target Entity agrees to protect the Zellers Entity with respect to risks through an indemnity or other arrangement satisfactory to Zellers;  
     
  (g)                                     not to seek, request or demand any charge or concession from any Target Entity or any other third party in connection with fulfilling its obligations under this Section 7.7, except as set forth in Section 7.7(2)(h); and  
     
  (h)                                     for each of the first 10 locations selected by any Target Entity (on an aggregate basis for all Target Entities) for cooperation by any Zellers Entity under this Section 7.7, such Zellers Entity shall be responsible and pay for all of the out of pocket costs incurred by such Zellers Entity in connection with any requests for cooperation made by such Target Entity relating to the initial redevelopment of such location by the Target Entity.  Thereafter, all requests for cooperation by any Target Entity relating to (i) each additional location, or (ii) to the extent unrelated to the initial redevelopment, each of the initial 10 locations, the related Zellers Entity and the Target Entity shall each be responsible for paying 50% of the out of pocket costs incurred by such Zellers Entity with respect to any such requests, and the Target Entity shall reimburse the Zellers Entity for its share of such costs  
     
  39    

in accordance with arrangements to be made between the related Target Entity and the Zellers Entity each acting reasonably.  
     
  (3)                                      Target Canada acknowledges that five Subject Developments (which are the following: Devonshire Mall, Windsor; Square One, Mississauga; Centrepoint Mall, North York; Les Promenades, St Bruno; and downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba) held by Zellers Entity Affiliates are subject to an existing Mortgage in favour of GE Capital Canada Finance Inc. which may be breached by the actions contemplated under Sections 7.7(2)(a) through (d) above.  The remaining Subject Developments are not subject to any other material restrictions relating to such actions under any Mortgage known to Zellers relating to the Subject Development as of the Execution Date.  If the Zellers Entity reasonably determines that such a breach will occur, then the Zellers Entity will use its commercially reasonable efforts (without payment of consideration or repayment of debt) to (i) obtain the consent from the Mortgage holder benefiting from the Approval Restriction in Section 7.7(2)(e)(ii) and/or (ii) allow for the requested co-operation of the Zellers Entity to be given in accordance with this Section 7.7.  
     
  (4)                                      So as to allow each Target Entity to confirm a Zellers Entity s compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.7 prior to commencing any of the above activities, each Zellers Entity will, upon a request of a Target Entity, enter into reasonable written documentation evidencing its agreement with respect to all approvals, consents and other requests of such Target Entity with respect to such contemplated location prior to the acquisition by such party.  
     
  (5)                                      Zellers and HBC, on behalf of each Zellers Entity, each agree that no Zellers Entity will subordinate its interest (or further restrict its rights to comply with the provisions of this Section 7.7) in any Subject Development to any future encumbrance unless such Zellers Entity receives a written non-disturbance agreement from the holder of such encumbrance with respect to the provisions of this Section 7.7.  
     
  (6)                                      The obligations of Zellers, HBC and each Zellers Entity pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each such Zellers Entity, including each successor owner of the Zellers Entity s interest in the Subject Development to which such obligations may now or in the future relate.  Such obligations shall bind and benefit, as the case may require, the heirs, legal representatives, assigns and successors of the respective parties, and all covenants, conditions and agreements contained in this Section 7.7 shall be construed (to the extent permitted by Laws) as covenants running with the land with respect to each Subject Development.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Zellers Entity shall, at its sole cost and expense (a) inform in writing each successor, assign and purchaser of each Subject Development of the provisions of this Section 7.7, and (b) cause each such successor, assign and purchaser to assume in writing the obligations of this Section 7.7.  
     
  (7)                                      Zellers and HBC, on behalf of each Zellers Entity, each agree that upon the request of any Target Entity, it shall execute, or cause the relevant Zellers Entity to execute, to the extent permitted by Laws (with such recordation being at the sole cost of such Target Entity), a recordable memorandum evidencing (i) the agreements contained in this Section 7.7 which may (at the Target Entity s option and cost) be registered on title in the  
     
  40    

applicable real estate records and (ii) all actions taken by such Zellers Entity pursuant to this Section 7.7.  
     
  (8)                                     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of each Zellers Entity and Target Entity under this Section 7.7 shall commence on the Execution Date and expire on that date that is 10 years after the Second Tranche Closing Date.

  (3)                                    If the Indemnifying Party assumes the investigation and defence of a Third Party Claim:

  (4)                                     If the Indemnified Party undertakes the defence of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

The Indemnified Party shall cooperate on a timely basis with the Indemnifying Party in the defence of any Third Party Claim.

(3)                                     Target and Target Canada may set off against any amounts payable by either or both of them to Zellers or HBC under this Agreement, any amounts owing to either or both of them by Zellers, HBC or any of their Affiliates under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including any amounts so owing under any indemnification obligations, up to a maximum aggregate amount to be so set off of $90 million.  
     
  (4)                                     The Parties acknowledge that the failure to comply with a covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement may give rise to irreparable injury to a Party inadequately compensable in damages.  Accordingly, a Party may seek to enforce the performance of this Agreement by injunction or specific performance upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction without proof of actual damage (and without requirement of posting a bond or other security).  
     
  (5)                                     Each of the Parties expressly waives and renounces any other remedies whatsoever, whether at law or in equity, which it would otherwise be entitled to as against any other Party.  
     
   Section 11.11                             One Recovery.   
     
  An Indemnified Party is not entitled to double recovery for any claims even though they may have resulted from the breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform of more than one of the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement.  
     
   Section 11.12                             Duty to Mitigate.   
     
  Nothing in this Agreement in any way restricts or limits the general obligation at Law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any loss which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.  If any claim can be reduced by any recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the Indemnified Party shall take all appropriate steps to enforce such recovery, settlement or payment and the amount of any Damages of the Indemnified Party will be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnified Party, net of any out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such recovery and net of the present value of any increase in insurance premiums reasonably attributable to such recovery.  
     
   Section 11.13                             Adjustment to Purchase Price.   
     
  Any payment made by Zellers or HBC to Target Canada under this Article 11 shall  be deemed to be a dollar-for-dollar decrease in the Purchase Price.  A payment made by Target Canada or Target under this Article 11 shall be deemed to be a dollar-for-dollar increase in the Purchase Price.

  (3)                                     Target hereby expressly waives the right to interpose all substantive and procedural defences of the law of guaranty, indemnification and suretyship, except the defences of prior payment or prior performance.

Section 13.4                                    Announcements.   
     
  No press release, public statement or announcement or other public disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement may be made except with the prior written consent and approval of Target, or except if required by Law or a Governmental Entity.  Where the public disclosure is required by Law or a Governmental Entity, the Party required to make the public disclosure (if not Target) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of Target as to the form, nature and extent of the disclosure.  The initial announcements of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be made in the form of attached as Section 13.4 of the Disclosure Letter.  
     
   Section 13.5                                    Third Party Beneficiaries.   
     
  Except as provided in Section 7.7, Zellers, HBC, Target and Target Canada intend that this Agreement will not benefit or create any right or cause of action directly in favour of any Person, other than the Parties; provided however, that the foregoing shall not limit or prohibit (i) Target or Target Canada from pursuing any and all claims, damages, remedies and rights provided hereunder on behalf of itself or for the benefit of any Designee or other assignee of Target Canada or (ii) any Designee from directly pursuing any rights under any Ancillary Agreements to which such Designee is a party.  Except for the Indemnified Parties, no Person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled to directly rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or other forum.  To the extent required by law to give full effect to these direct rights, Target Canada agrees and acknowledges that it is acting as agent and/or as trustee of its Indemnified Parties.  The Parties reserve their right, subject to unanimous agreement among the Parties, to vary or rescind the rights, granted by or under this Agreement to any Person who is not a Party, at any time and in any way whatsoever, without notice to or consent of that Person, including any Indemnified Party.  
     
   Section 13.6                                    Expenses.   
     
  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Party will pay for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement    and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The fees and expenses referred to in this Section are those which are incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including the fees and expenses of legal counsel, investment advisers and accountants.  
     
   Section 13.7                                    Amendments.   
     
  This Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by written agreement signed by Zellers and Target.  
     
   Section 13.8                                    Waiver.   
     
  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar).  No waiver will be binding unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver.  A Party s failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of that right.  A single or partial exercise of any right will  
     
  57    

not preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right.  
     
   Section 13.9                                    Non-Merger.   
     
  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants, representations and warranties shall not merge on and shall survive each of the relevant Closing Dates.  
     
   Section 13.10                             Subdivision Laws.   
     
  This Agreement shall only be effective to create an interest in the Subject Leased Properties if the subdivision control provisions of the  Planning Act  (Ontario) and similar Laws governing the subdivision or severance of real property in other provinces are complied with on or before the relevant Closing Date in respect of such Subject Leased Properties.  If necessary at any time and from time to time, Zellers shall forthwith apply for and use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all necessary consents under such Laws as required in order to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in respect of the Subject Leased Properties including, without limitation:  
     
  (i)                                         any necessary consents that were or are required in respect of any Subject Lease and any transfer occurring prior to the Execution Date; and  
     
  (ii)                                      any necessary consents that were or are required to allow Target Canada to obtain the benefit of the full term (including renewal rights) in excess of any reduced term that is deemed to be incorporated in the Subject Lease in the event a required consent was not obtained;  
     
  on or before the relevant Closing, and comply with any and all conditions imposed in respect of such consent, at its sole cost and expense.  Nothing in this Section 13.10, including non-compliance with the  Planning Act  (Ontario) and similar Laws governing subdivision or severance of real property in other provinces, will in any way affect Target Canada s obligation to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including paying the entire Purchase Price as contemplated by Section 3.1 without deduction or abatement of any kind; provided, however, that if such a consent will not reasonably be obtained by the relevant Closing Date, Target or Target Canada may take such interest, subject to such consent being obtained by Target or Target Canada at its expense following the relevant Closing Date or select another Subject Lease by notice given to Zellers.  
     
   Section 13.11                             Entire Agreement.   
     
  This Agreement,    together with    Ancillary Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties.  There are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.  The Parties have not relied and are not relying on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into and completing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
     
  58    

Section 13.12                             Successors and Assigns.   
     
  (1)                                     This Agreement becomes effective only when executed by Zellers, HBC and Target.  After that time, it is binding on and enures to the benefit of Zellers, HBC and Target, and Target Canada upon compliance with Section 1.12, and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  
     
  (2)                                     Other than as contemplated in Section 13.12 and Section 2.7, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under this Agreement are assignable or transferable by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties.  
     
   Section 13.13                             Severability.   
     
  If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Agreement or its application to any Party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or unenforceable, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such restriction, prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or without affecting its application to other Parties or circumstances.  
     
   Section 13.14                             Governing Law.   
     
  (1)                                     This Agreement is governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.  
     
  (2)                                     Each Party irrevocably attorns and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ontario courts situated in the City of Toronto and waives objection to the venue of any proceeding in such court or that such court provides an inconvenient forum.  
     
   Section 13.15                             Counterparts.   
     
  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including counterparts by facsimile) and all such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

The Cap Test Percentage as of the                           20       Determination Date is          % and based upon this Cap Test Percentage the amount of the Transferor Note Repurchase is $                         . The Available Series 2008-1 Principal Collections for the related Monthly Period is $                             .    Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Note Purchase Agreement.  
     
  On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements in the Note Purchase Agreement, but subject to the terms and conditions therein set forth, the Note Reseller agrees to resell to TRC, and TRC agrees to repurchase from the Note Reseller, a portion of the Note Principal Balance equal to [the Transferor Note Repurchase]/[$                     ]  .  The purchase price for this portion of the Note Principal Balance being purchased shall be the   Accreted Note Value, which is $                                   .  
     
  Payment of the purchase price shall be made by TRC in Federal (same day) funds by wire transfer to an account previously designated to TRC by the Note Reseller by 2:00 p.m. (New York time), on                              , 20     .

Pursuant to subsection 17(d) of the Note Purchase Agreement, the parties have agreed that any cancellation or reissuance of the Note is not required.  
     
  THIS   REPURCHASE AGREEMENT   SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.  

This   Repurchase Agreement   may be executed in two or more counterparts (and by different parties on separate counterparts), each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  
     
  For the avoidance of doubt, and not in limitation of the   repurchase   made herein, nothing in this   Repurchase Agreement   shall be deemed to supersede, enlarge, modify or waive any of the provisions of the   Note   Purchase Agreement, all of which shall survive the execution and delivery of this   Repurchase Agreement   as provided in, and subject to the limitations set forth in, the   Note   Purchase Agreement.
