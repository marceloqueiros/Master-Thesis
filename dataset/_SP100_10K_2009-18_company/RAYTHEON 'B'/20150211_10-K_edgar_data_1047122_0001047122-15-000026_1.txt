  Sales to the U.S. Government 

(1) 
    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. Government. 
       
  Our principal U.S. Government customer is the DoD; other U.S. Government customers include Intelligence Community agencies, NASA, the FAA and the Departments of Justice, State, and Energy. 
    
  U.S. Government Contracts and Regulation 
  We act as a prime contractor or major subcontractor for numerous U.S. Government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. Government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs. We are also subject to certain unique business risks associated with U.S. Government program funding and appropriations and government  

6 

           Table of Contents  

   contracts, and with supplying technologically-advanced, cutting edge defense-related products and services to the U.S. Government.  
  U.S. Government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. Government, department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD's Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor's failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, and lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. Government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of and a contractor's compliance with its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. For a discussion of certain risks associated with compliance with U.S. Government contract regulations and requirements, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K.  
  U.S. Government contracts include both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts, subject to a contract-ceiling amount in certain cases, provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus the payment of a fee. These contracts fall into three basic types: (i) cost plus fixed fee contracts which provide for the payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii) cost plus incentive fee contracts which provide for increases or decreases in the fee, within specified limits, based upon actual cost results compared to contractual cost targets; and (iii) cost plus award fee contracts which provide for the payment of an award fee determined at the discretion of the customer based upon the performance of the contractor against pre-established criteria. Under cost reimbursement type contracts, the contractor is reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and is paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some costs incidental to performing contracts have been made partially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute, the FAR or other regulation. Examples of such costs include charitable contributions, certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs.  
  Fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, the contractor agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price and as a result, benefits from cost savings and carries the burden of cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, the contractor shares with the U.S. Government savings accrued from contracts performed for less than target costs and costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost) and carries the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, the contractor's profit may also be adjusted up or down depending upon whether specified performance objectives are met. Under FFP and FPI incentive type contracts, the contractor usually receives either performance-based payments (PBPs) equaling up to 90% of the contract price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government generally in amounts equaling 80% of costs incurred under U.S. Government contracts. The remaining amount, including profits or incentive fees, is billed upon delivery and acceptance of end items under the contract. The DoD has expressed a preference to utilize progress payments based on costs incurred on new fixed-price contract awards as opposed to PBPs unless the contractor negotiates for PBPs. Generally speaking and subject to a number of factors, PBPs can provide improved cash flows as compared to progress payments but introduce risk to contractors in return. The DoD has also expressed a preference to utilize FPI as opposed to FFP type contracts. FPI contracts may attract a lower target fee than might be anticipated under FFP contracts, but offer the opportunity to increase fees based on performance. In the event we experience a greater proportion of FPI type contracts and/or progress payments for our fixed-price DoD contracts in the future than historically, it could have an adverse effect on our operating margins, cash flow and liquidity. For a discussion of certain risks associated with fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts and risks associated with changes in U.S. Government procurement rules, regulations and business practices, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
  U.S. Government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. Government's convenience or for default based on performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, the contractor is generally entitled to payments for its allowable costs and will receive some allowance for  

7 

           Table of Contents  

   profit on the work performed. If a contract is terminated for default, the contractor is generally entitled to payments for its work that has been accepted by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government's right to terminate its contracts has not had a material adverse effect upon our operations, financial condition or liquidity. For a discussion of the risks associated with the U.S. Government's right to terminate its contracts, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K.  
  U.S. Government programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts and subcontracts. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. The contracts and subcontracts under a program generally are subject to termination for convenience or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or change. The U.S. Government is required to equitably adjust a contract price for additions or reductions in scope or other changes ordered by it. For a discussion of the risks associated with program funding and appropriations, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  and  Overview  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K. In addition, because we are engaged in supplying technologically-advanced, cutting edge defense-related products and services to the U.S. Government, we are subject to certain business risks, some of which are specific to our industry. These risks include: the cost of obtaining and retaining trained and skilled employees; the uncertainty and instability of prices for raw materials and supplies; the problems associated with advanced designs, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; and the intense competition and the constant necessity for improvement in facility utilization and personnel training. Our sales to the U.S. Government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing priorities for national defense, political developments abroad and other factors. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  and  Overview  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these and other related risks.  
  We are also involved in U.S. Government programs, principally through our IIS and SAS business segments, that are classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described in this Form 10-K. The operating results of these classified programs are included in the applicable business segment's and our consolidated results of operations. The business risks and considerations associated with these and our international classified programs generally do not differ materially from those of our other U.S. Government and international programs and products. Total classified sales were   15%   in   2014   and   2013  , and   16%   in   2012  . 
    
  We are subject to government regulations and contract requirements that may differ from U.S. Government regulation with respect to our sales to non-U.S. customers. See  International Sales  below for more information regarding our sales outside of the U.S. and Item 1A  Risk Factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with international sales.  
    
  See  Sales to the U.S. Government  on page   6   of this Form 10-K for information regarding the percentage of our revenues generated from sales to the U.S. Government. 
    
  International Sales   

International sales were principally in the areas of air and missile defense systems, missile systems, airborne radars, naval systems, air traffic control systems, electronic equipment, computer software and systems, personnel training, equipment maintenance and microwave communications technology, and other products and services permitted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Generally, we internally fund our foreign subsidiary working capital requirements in the applicable countries. Sales and income from international operations and investments are subject to U.S. Government laws, regulations and policies, including the ITAR and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and the export laws and regulations described below. They are also subject to foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. Government regulation, including import-export control, technology transfer, investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and requirements to expend a portion of program funds in-country through manufacturing agreements or other financial support obligations, known as offset obligations. In addition, embargoes, international hostilities and changes in currency and commodity values can also impact our international sales. Exchange restrictions imposed by various countries could restrict the transfer of funds  

8 

           Table of Contents  

   between countries, us and our subsidiaries. We have acted to protect ourselves against various risks through insurance, foreign exchange contracts, contract provisions, government guarantees and/or progress payments. Our international sales in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively, the majority of which were in British pounds and Australian dollars with the remainder primarily in euros and Canadian dollars. See total net sales and property, plant and equipment by geographical area set forth in  Note 15: Business Segment Reporting  within Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 
    
  In connection with certain foreign sales, we utilize the services of sales representatives who are paid commissions in return for services rendered.  
    
  Depending on the type of international sale, Raytheon must either seek various approvals from the U.S. Government under the foreign military sales process or may require an export authorization and the issuance of a license by either the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (formerly the Foreign Military Sales Act) and its implementing regulations under the ITAR, the U.S. Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act and its implementing regulations as kept in force by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), and/or the U.S. Department of the Treasury under IEEPA or the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Such licenses may be denied for reasons of U.S. national security or foreign policy. In the case of certain exports of defense equipment and services, the Department of State must notify Congress at least 15 30 days (depending on the identity of the importing country that will utilize the equipment and services) prior to authorizing such exports. During that time, Congress may take action to block or delay a proposed export by joint resolution which is subject to Presidential veto. Additional information regarding the risks associated with our international business is contained in Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Backlog 

(1) 
    Excludes foreign military sales backlog through the U.S. Government. 
              (2) 
    Includes foreign military sales backlog through the U.S. Government. 
       
  Approximately   $17.2 billion   of the   December 31, 2014   year-end backlog is not expected to be filled during the following twelve months. These amounts include both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated or obligated to us). For additional information related to backlog figures, see  Segment Results  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Research and Development 
  We conduct extensive research and development activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, and develop new products and services to meet our customers  changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. During   2014   we expended   $500 million   on research and development efforts compared to   $465 million   and   $451 million   in   2013   and   2012  , respectively. These expenditures principally have been for product development for the U.S. Government. We also conduct funded research and development activities under U.S. Government contracts which are included in total net sales. For additional information related to our research and development activities, see  Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Raw Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality 
  We are dependent upon the delivery of materials by suppliers, and the assembly of major components and subsystems by subcontractors used in our products. Some products require relatively scarce raw materials. In addition, we must comply  

9 

           Table of Contents  

   with specific procurement requirements which may, in effect, limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. In some instances, for a variety of reasons, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers. We enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and take other actions to ensure the availability of needed materials, components and subsystems. We are also dependent on suppliers to provide genuine original equipment manufacturer parts and have a robust set of standardized policies to detect counterfeit material, especially electronic components, throughout our supply chain. We generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products. We also are subject to rules promulgated by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2012 pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that require us to conduct due diligence on and disclose if we are able to determine whether certain materials (including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, that originate from mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or certain adjoining countries (DRC), are used in our products. We timely filed our first DRC minerals report on Form SD in 2014 stating that we were not able to determine the country of origin of conflict minerals contained in our manufactured products. 
    
  In recent years, our revenues in the second half of the year have generally exceeded revenues in the first half. The timing of new program awards, the availability of U.S. Government funding, the timing of international contract awards and approvals, and product delivery schedules are among the factors affecting the periods in which revenues are recorded. We expect this trend to continue in 2015. 
    
  Competition 
  We directly participate in most major areas of development in the defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support markets. Technical superiority, reputation, price, past performance, delivery schedules, financing and reliability are among the principal competitive factors considered by customers in these markets. We compete worldwide with a number of U.S. and international companies in these markets, some of which may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. We frequently partner on various programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. In addition, U.S. defense spending levels in the near future are increasingly difficult to predict. Changes in U.S. defense spending may potentially limit certain future market opportunities. See Item 1A  Risk Factors  and  Overview  within Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of these and other related risks. 
    
  Patents and Licenses 
  We own an intellectual property portfolio that includes many U.S. and foreign patents, as well as unpatented trade secrets and know-how, data, software, trademarks and copyrights, all of which contribute to the preservation of our competitive position in the market. In certain instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. We also license our intellectual property to others, including our customers, in certain instances. The U.S. Government has licenses in certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, developed in the performance of U.S. Government contracts, and has the right to use and authorize others to use such intellectual property, including the inventions covered by such patents for U.S. Government purposes. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our operations, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
    
  Employment 
  As of December 31, 2014  , we had approximately   61,000   employees. Approximately   8%   of our employees are unionized. We consider our union-management relationships to be generally satisfactory. 
    
  Environmental Regulation 
  Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of international, federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations. We have provided for the estimated cost to complete remediation or, in the case of multi-party sites, our reasonably expected share thereof where we have determined that it is probable that we will incur such costs in the future in connection with (i) facilities that are now, or were previously, owned or operated by us, (ii) sites where we have been named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similarly designated by other environmental agencies, or (iii) sites where we have been named in a cost recovery or contribution claim by a non-governmental third-party. It is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate amount of environmental cleanup costs to be  

10 

           Table of Contents  

   incurred in the future due to the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the discovery and application of innovative remediation technologies, and the status and interpretation of laws and regulations.  
    
  In order to assess the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, we estimate the possible remediation costs that we could reasonably incur. Such estimates take into consideration the professional judgment of our environmental professionals and, in most cases, consultations with outside environmental specialists.  
    
  If we are ultimately found to have liability at a multi-party site where we have been designated a PRP or have been named in a cost recovery or contribution claim from a non-governmental third-party, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other PRPs. Generally in the U.S. and certain other countries, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean-up and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials. Under existing U.S. environmental laws, responsible parties are usually jointly and severally liable and, therefore, potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we are required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the unlikely event that we would be required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, nor do they reflect the possibility that we may recover some of these environmental costs from insurance policies or from other PRPs. However, a portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government.  
    
  We manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. Government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. Government and we relied (and continue to rely with respect to past practices) upon U.S. Government funding to pay such costs. While the government remains responsible for capital and operating costs associated with environmental compliance, responsibility for fines and penalties associated with environmental noncompliance is typically borne by either the U.S. Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Fines and penalties are unallowable costs under the contracts pursuant to which such facilities are managed.  
    
  Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were to be convicted of a criminal violation of certain U.S. federal environmental statutes, including the Federal Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be placed by the EPA on the  Excluded Parties List  maintained by the Government Services Administration. The listing would continue until the EPA concluded that the cause of the violation had been cured. Listed facilities cannot be used in performing any U.S. Government contract awarded during any period of listing by the EPA.  
    
  Additional information regarding the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and the resolution of environmental claims against us and our operations is contained in Item 1A  Risk Factors,   Commitments and Contingencies  within Item 7 and  Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies  within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

    ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  This Form 10-K and the information we are incorporating by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including information regarding our financial outlook, future plans, objectives, business prospects, products and services, trends and anticipated financial performance including with respect to our liquidity and capital resources, our backlog, our pension expense and funding, the impact of new accounting pronouncements, our unrecognized tax benefits and the impact and outcome of audits and legal and administrative proceedings, claims, investigations, commitments and contingencies, as well as information regarding domestic and international defense spending and budgets. You can identify these statements by the fact that they include words such as  will,   believe,   anticipate,   expect,   estimate,   intend,   plan,  or variations of these words, or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts and represent only our current expectations regarding such matters. These statements inherently involve a wide range of known and unknown uncertainties. Our actual actions and results could differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these statements. Specific factors that could cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those set forth below and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. Given these factors, as well as other variables that may affect our operating results, you should not rely on forward-looking statements, assume that past financial performance will be a reliable indicator of future performance, or use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. We expressly disclaim any obligation or intention to provide updates to the forward-looking statements and the estimates and assumptions associated with them. 
    
  We depend on the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in government defense spending and priorities could have consequences on our financial position, results of operations and business. 
    
  In   2014  , U.S. Government sales, excluding foreign military sales, accounted for approximately   70%   of our total net sales. Our revenues from the U.S. Government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. Government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the DoD, as well as a broad range of programs with the Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. The funding of our programs is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. Government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling. 
    
  U.S. Government appropriations have and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. In 2011, the Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (BCA), and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, a sequestration went into effect on March 1, 2013 resulting in a 7.8% reduction to the DoD budget for fiscal year (FY) 2013 to $495.5 billion, excluding funding for military personnel. The FY 2014 DoD base budget was essentially flat at $496 billion and FY 2015 remains at a similar level.  
    
  Unless Congress and the Administration agree to further amend or revoke the BCA, the DoD base budget is expected to increase very modestly to approximately $500 billion for FY 2016. In the years beyond FY 2016, the BCA permits annual increases for DoD base budget funding of about 2.4 percent with such caps remaining in effect through FY 2023. The Administration has publicly signaled its intent to submit budget requests that are significantly higher than the BCA caps, as it did in submitting the FY 2016 budget request and the associated FY 2016 FYDP on February 2, 2015 with all years exceeding the caps under the BCA. Such levels of DoD budget funding would require the Congress to enact legislation to raise the BCA caps. In the event that DoD appropriations exceed the BCA caps in any fiscal year through FY 2023, an across-the-board sequestration would go into effect, as occurred in FY 2013. Conversely, the Congress could choose to reduce any above-BCA cap budget request, as it did for FY 2014 appropriations.

   In addition, the U.S. Government has, on a number of occasions, been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), which resulted in it operating under a Continuing Resolution (CR) for extended periods, as well as a brief partial shutdown of the U.S. Government in October 2013. As a result, future U.S. Government defense spending levels are difficult to predict. Significant changes in defense spending or changes in U.S. Government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  
    
  In addition, we are involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. Government, principally through our IIS and SAS business segments, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes and claims. 
    
  Our financial results largely are dependent on our ability to perform on our U.S. Government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding and timing, as well as termination.  
    
  Our financial results largely are dependent on our performance under our U.S. Government contracts. While we are involved in numerous programs and are party to thousands of U.S. Government contracts, the termination of one or more of such contracts, or the occurrence of delays, cost overruns and product failures in connection with one or more large contracts, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Furthermore, we can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. Government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of termination of any of our contracts.  
    
  The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. The U.S. Government programs in which we participate also must compete with other programs and priorities for consideration and funding during the budget and appropriations process. See the discussion above for more information on the risks relating to changes in U.S. defense spending levels and priorities. 
    
  In addition, when a formal appropriation bill has not been signed into law before the end of the fiscal year, Congress may pass a CR that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate, generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but typically does not authorize new spending initiatives during this period. If Congress fails to enact a CR, the U.S. Government may shut down, which likely would result in the closure of government offices and furlough of government workers and the lack of funds to pay its contractors for work performed. In addition, if the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling, which is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2015, the Congress must enact legislation to increase the statutory debt ceiling. If Congress fails to do so, then the U.S. Government may default on its debts, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the global financial markets. 
    
  Until regular appropriation bills are passed, delays can occur in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and these delays can affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity during the period of delay. Under certain circumstances, we may continue to perform under our U.S. Government contracts without funding and use our own funds in order to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements. Furthermore, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, or are reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government, which could have a negative impact on our future sales under such contract or subcontract. 
    
  In addition, U.S. Government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. Government's convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the U.S. Government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor.  
    
  Our U.S. Government contracts also typically involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. New technologies may be untested or  

13 

           Table of Contents  

   unproven. In some instances, product requirements or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns and product failures, in connection with performing our U.S. Government contracts. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. Government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investment amounts may not be recouped if we are not chosen for new contract awards. 
    
  Our international business is subject to geopolitical and economic factors, regulatory requirements and other risks. 
    
  Our international business exposes us to geopolitical and economic factors, regulatory requirements, increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. These risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic business. In 2014, our sales to customers outside the U.S. (including foreign military sales through the U.S. Government) accounted for   29%   of our total net sales. Our exposure to such risks may increase if our international business continues to grow as we anticipate.  
    
  Our international business is sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in worldwide economic conditions, and various regional and local economic and political factors, including volatility in energy prices, changes in U.S. foreign policy, and other risks and uncertainties. Our international sales are subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the ITAR, the FCPA, and other anti-corruption and export laws and regulations. We maintain policies and controls to comply with such laws and regulations and exercise oversight of such compliance. However, any failure by us or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and resolutions could result in criminal, civil or administrative penalties, including fines, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our ability to export our products. In addition, due to the nature of our products, we must first obtain licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell our products outside of the U.S. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that certain sales will not be prevented or delayed. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  
    
  Our international sales are also subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices which may differ from U.S. Government regulations. These include regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Furthermore, our international sales contracts may be subject to non-U.S. contract laws and regulations and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or terms that may be interpreted differently by foreign courts. These contracts may also be subject to termination at the customer's convenience or for default based on performance, and may be subject to funding risks. In addition, the timing of orders, customer negotiations, governmental approvals and notifications from our international customers can be less predictable than from our domestic customers, and this may lead to variations in international bookings and sales each year. We must also manage a certain degree of exposure to the risk of currency fluctuations. 
    
  Our international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may receive loans, marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments which may not be available to U.S. Government contractors. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. Government contractors. 
    
  Our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. Approvals of offset thresholds and requirements may be subjective, time consuming and may delay contract awards, and may, in certain countries, require the creation of a joint venture with a local company, which may control the venture. This may result in our being liable for violations of law for actions taken by these entities such as laws related to anti-corruption, import and export, or local laws which may differ from U.S. laws and requirements. Such offset obligations are generally multi-year arrangements and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. We also are exposed to risks associated with using third-party foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations, and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers in connection with international programs. As a result of these factors, we could experience financial  

14 

           Table of Contents  

   penalties, award and funding delays on international programs and could incur losses on such programs which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
    
  As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to extensive procurement rules and regulations, and changes in such rules, regulations and business practice could negatively affect current programs and potential awards.  
    
  Government contractors must also comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements including import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. Government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs. In addition, current U.S. Government budgetary constraints have and may continue to lead to changes in the procurement environment. For example, the DoD continues initiatives focused on efficiencies, affordability and cost growth and other changes to its procurement practices such as changes in payment term preferences. If and to the extent additional changes occur as a result of these initiatives or otherwise, they could impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and could affect whether and, if so, how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so.  
    
  In addition, failure to comply with the procurement regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other U.S. Government contracts in the future. 
    
  Our future success depends on our ability to develop new offerings and technologies for our current and future markets. 
    
  To achieve our business strategies and continue to grow our revenues and operating profit, we must successfully develop new offerings and technologies or adapt or modify our existing offerings and technologies for our current core defense markets and our future markets, including new international, civil, commercial, growth and emerging markets. Accordingly, our future performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: 
    
           - 
    Identify the needs of, and growth opportunities in, new and emerging markets; 
              - 
    Identify emerging technological and other trends in our current and future markets; 
              - 
    Identify additional uses for our existing technology to address customer needs in our current and future markets;  
              - 
    Develop and maintain competitive products and services for our current and future markets;  
              - 
    Enhance our offerings by adding innovative features that differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors; 
              - 
    Develop, manufacture and bring solutions to market quickly at cost-effective prices; 
              - 
    Enhance product designs for export and releasability to international markets; and 
              - 
    Effectively structure our businesses, through the use of joint ventures, collaborative agreements and other forms of alliances, to reflect the competitive environment. 
       
  We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to invest significant financial resources to develop new offerings and technologies or to adapt or modify our existing offerings and technologies, including through internal research and development, acquisitions and joint ventures or other teaming arrangements. We believe this is true to meet demands and expand within both our domestic and international markets. These expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies or identification of and expansion into new markets. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or deflect resources from other projects. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market for our offerings will develop or continue to expand or that we will be successful in newly identified markets as we currently anticipate or that the acquisitions, joint ventures or other  

15 

           Table of Contents  

   teaming arrangements we may enter into in pursuit of developing new offerings and technologies will be successful. The failure of our technology to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products. 
    
  Additionally, the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our new product development efforts or our products or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  Competition within our markets may reduce our revenues and market share. 
    
  We operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. We anticipate increasing competition in our core markets as a result of continued defense industry consolidation, including cross-border consolidation of competition, which has enabled companies to enhance their competitive position and ability to compete against us. We are also facing heightened competition in our domestic and international markets from foreign and multinational firms. In addition, as discussed in more detail above, increased pressure to limit U.S. defense spending and changes in the U.S. Government procurement environment may limit certain future market opportunities. For example, the DoD increasingly is committed to awarding contracts through competitive bidding and relying on competitive contract award types. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other support work. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, due to the current competitive environment, we continue to see an increase in bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned, requiring a re-bid of the contract. 
    
  We enter into fixed-price and other contracts which could subject us to losses in the event that we experience cost growth that cannot be billed to customers. 
    
  Generally, our customer contracts are either fixed-priced or cost reimbursable contracts. Under fixed-priced contracts, which represent approximately   60%   of our backlog, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and, consequently, we carry the burden of any cost overruns. Due to their nature, fixed-priced contracts inherently have more risk than cost reimbursable contracts, particularly fixed-price development contracts where the costs to complete the development stage of the program can be highly variable, uncertain and difficult to estimate. Under cost reimbursable contracts, subject to a contract-ceiling amount in certain cases, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based. If our costs exceed the contract ceiling and are not authorized by the customer or are not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs and our fees may be reduced or eliminated. Because many of our contracts involve advanced designs and innovative technologies, we may experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns. Under both types of contracts, if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, we may not realize their full benefits. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns and cost controls would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
    
  Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit or investigatory finding by the U.S. Government. 
    
  As a government contractor, we are subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government agencies including the DCAA, the DCMA, the Inspector General of the DoD and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether a contractor s operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of and a contractor's compliance with its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also  

16 

           Table of Contents  

   subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. Government. In addition, the DoJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. 
    
  We depend on component availability, subcontractor performance and our key suppliers to manufacture and deliver our products and services.  
    
  We are dependent upon the delivery by suppliers of materials and the assembly by subcontractors of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely and satisfactory manner and in full compliance with applicable terms and conditions. Some products require relatively scarce raw materials. We also are subject to specific procurement requirements that may, in effect, limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize, including requirements for genuine original equipment manufacturer parts. As we continue to seek further cost efficiencies throughout the enterprise, we may centralize procurements in order to attain better pricing through strategic sourcing. 
    
  In some instances, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers. If any of these suppliers or subcontractors fails to meet our needs or becomes insolvent, we may not have readily available alternatives or alternatives at prices that meet the demands of our customers. While we enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and take other actions, such as accelerating supplier payments commensurate with value delivered, to ensure financial viability and the availability of needed materials, components and subsystems, we cannot be sure that such items will be available in the quantities we require, if at all. In addition, some of our suppliers or subcontractors, especially smaller entities, may continue to be impacted by global economic conditions, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. If we experience a material supplier or subcontractor problem, our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our customer obligations could be negatively impacted which could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts and damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers. We could also incur additional costs in addressing such a problem. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, we must comply with other procurement requirements, including restrictions on the use of certain chemicals in the European Union and conducting diligence and providing disclosure regarding the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, which may impact our procurement practices and increase our costs.  
    
  We use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.  
    
  Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, including risks associated with customer-directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters, judgments associated with estimating contract revenues and costs, and assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, we must make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials; consider whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented; consider incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating sales and profit rates, and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance; and use estimates of award fees in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  For a complete discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by contract accounting policies, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  beginning on page   34   within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

           Table of Contents  

   Significant changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates and assumed long-term return on assets (ROA), as well as our actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our earnings, equity and pension contributions in future periods.  
    
  We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plans' expense or income which involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to our discount rate, long-term ROA and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other postretirement benefit plans' expense and funded status, and our cash contributions to such plans, could negatively change which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, differences between our actual investment returns and our long-term ROA assumption would result in a change to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans' expense and funded status and our required contributions to the plans. They may also be impacted by changes in regulatory, accounting and other requirements applicable to pensions. 
    
  For a complete discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plan accounting policies, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  beginning on page   34   within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  
    
  We have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions and investments, and these activities involve risks and uncertainties.  
    
  In pursuing our business strategies, we continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments and acquisitions. We undertake to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base, as well as expand our offerings and market reach into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities. In evaluating such transactions, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Furthermore, acquisitions and investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties, including the risks involved with entering new markets, the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses, the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from acquisitions or investments, the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives, the potential impairment of acquired assets and liabilities, the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies and the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses. 
    
  We have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into joint venture, teaming and other arrangements, and these activities involve risks and uncertainties.  
    
  We have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into joint venture, teaming and other collaborative arrangements. These activities involve risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the joint venture or applicable entity failing to satisfy its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, difficulties in achieving strategic objectives and expected benefits of the business arrangement, the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. 
    
  Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets, and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately   $13.7 billion  , net of accumulated amortization, which represented approximately   49%   of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business which will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues which adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

  Our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and disruptions.  
    
  As a U.S. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, threats to physical security, and possible domestic terrorism events. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, which generally face similar security threats. Cybersecurity threats in particular are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service and other electronic security breaches. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures and controls and we have invested in highly skilled IT resources to appropriately identify threats and mitigate potential risks, but there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to mission critical systems, the unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. Although we have in the past and will in the future be the subject of such cybersecurity incidents, to date none have had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, these types of events could disrupt our operations or customer and other third-party IT systems in which we are involved. They also could require significant management attention and resources, and could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  The outcome of litigation in which we have been named as a defendant is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  We are the defendant in a number of litigation matters and are subject to various other claims, demands and investigations. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims, demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.  
    
  Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, certain personnel may be required to receive security clearance and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business. 
    
  Some of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.  
    
  Approximately   5,000   of our employees are unionized, which represents approximately   8%   of our employee base at   December 31, 2014  . As a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.  
    
  We own many U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, and have rights in unpatented know-how, data, software, trademarks and copyrights. The U.S. Government has licenses under certain of our patents and certain other intellectual  

19 

           Table of Contents  

   property that are developed or used in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others, including our competitors, to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes. The U.S. Government may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in U.S. Government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights. There can be no assurance that any of our patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or circumvented by third parties. In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. In the future, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or third-party development of similar technologies. Moreover, the laws concerning intellectual property vary among nations and the protection provided to our intellectual property by the laws and courts of foreign nations may not be as advantageous to us as the remedies available under U.S. law. 
    
  Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.  
    
  We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and, in some cases, have been named as a defendant in related  toxic tort  claims.  
    
  We are also subject to laws and regulations that: (i) impose requirements for the proper management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (ii) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. Government-owned facilities we manage); and (iii) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases and/or reduce the risks of injury to people in our workplaces.  
    
  If we were to be convicted of a criminal violation of certain U.S. federal environmental statutes, including the Federal Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be placed by the EPA on the  Excluded Parties List  maintained by the Government Services Administration. The listing would continue until the EPA concluded that the cause of the violation had been cured. Listed facilities cannot be used in performing any U.S. Government contract awarded during any period of listing by the EPA. 
    
  We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance.  
    
  A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services, including but not limited to missile systems, command and control systems, border security systems, and air traffic management systems. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses from the qualification of our products and services by the DHS under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, or otherwise. The amount of the insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and it is not possible to obtain insurance or indemnification coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

   Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.  
    
  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability.

    ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
    
  We and our subsidiaries operate in a number of plants, laboratories, warehouses and office facilities in the U.S. and abroad. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2014   we owned, leased and/or utilized (through operating agreements) approximately   28.3 million   square feet of floor space for manufacturing, engineering, research, administration, sales and warehousing, approximately   93%   of which was located in the U.S. Of the total, approximately   50%   was owned (or held under a long-term ground lease with ownership of the improvements), approximately   45%   was leased, and approximately   5%   was Government owned. In addition to the   28.3 million   square feet of floor space described above, approximately   317,896   square feet of space was leased or subleased by us to unrelated third parties.

    ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We primarily engage in providing products and services under contracts with the U.S. Government and, to a lesser degree, under direct foreign sales contracts, some of which the U.S. Government funds. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to many levels of audit and investigation by the U.S. Government relating to our contract performance and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the DCAA, the DCMA, the Inspector General of the DoD and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the DoJ and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracting. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. Government with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DoJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S. and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. Government regulations (e.g., the FCPA and ITAR) may also be investigated or audited. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. 
    
  On August 18, 2010, the U.K. Border Agency (UKBA) initiated arbitration proceedings in the London Court of International Arbitration against Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL) in connection with the parties' dispute with respect to the UKBA's termination of RSL for cause on a program. The UKBA claimed that RSL had failed to perform on certain key milestones and other matters, and that the UKBA was entitled to recovery of certain losses incurred and previous payments made to RSL. In March 2011, the UKBA gave notice that it had presented a demand to draw on the approximately   $80 million   of letters of credit provided by RSL upon the signing of the contract with the UKBA in 2007. At RSL's request, the Arbitration Tribunal (Tribunal) initially issued an interim order restraining the drawdown but, following a hearing on the issue, lifted the restraint and concluded that any decision on the UKBA's right to call on the letters of credit is inextricably intertwined with the ultimate decision on the merits in the arbitration. The Tribunal also preserved RSL's right to claim damages should RSL later establish that the drawdown was not valid. To date, the UKBA has submitted total net claims in the arbitration of approximately    302 million   (approximately   $470 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  ) for damages, clawback of previous payments, and interest, and inclusion of a credit for capability delivered by RSL. RSL has submitted in the arbitration its defenses to the UKBA claim as well as substantial counterclaims in the amount of approximately    500 million   (approximately   $778 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  ) against the UKBA for the collection of receivables, damages and interest. Arbitration hearings commenced in late 2012 and were completed in 2013. We continue to believe that the receivables and other assets  

22 

           Table of Contents  

   remaining under the program for technology and services delivered of approximately   $40 million   at   December 31, 2014   are probable of recovery. 
    
  On August 15, 2014, RSL received a decision from the Tribunal. The Tribunal found that the UKBA had unlawfully terminated RSL for default and had therefore repudiated the eBorders contract with RSL. Accordingly, the Tribunal denied the UKBA's claims for damages and clawback of previous payments. In addition, the Tribunal found that the UKBA had wrongfully retained the   $80 million   it had drawn on RSL letters of credit in April 2011. The Tribunal awarded RSL approximately    185 million   (approximately   $288 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  ) as payment for capabilities delivered, damages and other monetary relief. The Tribunal reserved ruling on costs and on the quantification of interest payable to RSL for a later date. 
    
  On September 15, 2014, the UKBA filed a challenge to the award in the London High Court. RSL is vigorously opposing such challenge. The payment of amounts awarded to RSL is now pending resolution of the challenge. Due to the inherent uncertainties of arbitration and litigation, no amounts regarding this matter were recorded in our financial results for the year ended   December 31, 2014  . 
  Additional information regarding arbitration with the UKBA is contained in  Commitments and Contingencies  within Item 7 and  Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies  within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
    
  In addition, various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against us. We do not expect these proceedings to result in any additional liability that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

    This amount includes   2,310,766   shares, which is the aggregate of the actual number of shares that will be issued pursuant to the   2012   Long-term Performance Plan (LTPP) awards and the maximum number of shares that may be issued upon settlement of outstanding   2013   and   2014   LTPP awards, including estimated dividend equivalent amounts. The shares to be issued pursuant to the   2012  ,   2013   and   2014   LTPP awards will be issued under the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan (2010 Stock Plan).

  Faced with significant budget pressures, in recent years, the U.S. Government has implemented reductions in government spending, including reductions in appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies, pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, a sequestration went into effect in March 2013 resulting in a 7.8% reduction to the DoD budget for fiscal year (FY) 2013 to $495.5 billion, excluding funding for military personnel. The DoD budget was approximately $496 billion in FY 2014 and remains at a similar level in FY 2015. The DoD base budget excludes funding for overseas contingency operations, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, which are appropriated separately and are not currently subject to the BCA. 
    
  Under the BCA, funding for the DoD base budget is expected to increase very modestly to approximately $500 billion for FY 2016. In the years beyond FY 2016, the BCA permits annual increases for DoD base budget funding of about 2.4% with such caps remaining in force through FY 2023. The Administration has publicly signaled its intent to submit DoD budget requests that are significantly higher than the BCA caps, as it did in submitting the FY 2016 budget request and the associated FY 2016 FYDP on February 2, 2015 with all years exceeding the caps under the BCA. Such levels of DoD budget funding would require the Congress to enact legislation to raise the BCA caps. In the event DoD appropriations exceed the BCA caps in any fiscal year through FY 2023, across-the-board sequestration would go into effect, as occurred in 2013.

   Consequently, the DoD s overall future spending levels remain uncertain and we are unable to specifically predict potential changes to future DoD budgets on our programs and the effect that the foregoing would have on our future financial performance and outlook. The impact of sequestration on our 2013 and 2014 total net sales was less in each case than the FY 2013 7.8% reduction noted above due to our international business, our position relative to critical DoD priorities and mission areas, and the length of time that it takes for sequestration reductions to impact future contracts. We believe that the risk of future impacts would similarly be balanced due to our focus on expanding further into international, civil and commercial markets that naturally extend from our core capabilities. However, in the event that BCA funding levels continue, or if other actions are taken to significantly reduce the DoD budget, it is possible that such reductions and related cancellations or delays affecting our existing contracts or programs could have a significant impact on the operating results of our business. 
    
  U.S. Government appropriations have and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. When a formal appropriation bill has not been signed into law before the end of the fiscal year, Congress may pass a Continuing Resolution (CR) that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate, generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but typically does not authorize new spending initiatives during this period. If Congress fails to enact a CR, the U.S. Government may shut down, which likely would result in the closure of government offices and furlough of government workers, as well as impact the availability of funds to pay its contractors for work performed. In addition, if the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling, which is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2015, the Congress must enact legislation to increase the statutory debt ceiling. If the Congress fails to do so, then the U.S. Government may default on its debts, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the global financial markets. 
    
  With respect to U.S. defense priorities, the DoD conducted a Strategic Choices and Management Review (SCMR) in 2013 to provide its leadership with various options to meet the DoD s strategic objectives in light of sequestration and the budgetary uncertainty the DoD faces. As a result of the SCMR, the DoD reiterated its commitment to the strategic guidance issued in January 2012 regarding its priorities through 2019 and possibly beyond. The 2012 DoD guidance identified the primary missions of the U.S. armed forces and the capabilities expected to be critical to future success, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), missile defense, electronic warfare, unmanned systems, special operations forces, interoperability with allied forces and cybersecurity. The SCMR acknowledged that under decreased spending levels due to sequestration, the DoD would not meet all of its strategic objectives, but did not identify the impacted specific objectives nor the extent to which they would not be met. These priorities and acknowledgement of not meeting certain objectives were largely reaffirmed in both the DoD s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), a congressionally-mandated report that addresses the DoD s long-term strategies and priorities, and the July 2014 review by the National Defense Panel, a bi-partisan group of senior civilians and military officers appointed by Congress to review the QDR.  
    
  U.S. Government sales, excluding foreign military sales, accounted for   70%   of our total net sales in   2014  . Our principal U.S. Government customer is the DoD. Given the current budget environment, including the elements noted above, future domestic defense spending levels are difficult to predict. A number of additional factors potentially impacting the DoD budget include the following: 
           - 
    External threats to our national security, including potential security threats posed by terrorists, emerging nuclear states and other countries; 
              - 
    Support for on-going operations overseas, including countering terrorism, which will require funding above and beyond the DoD base budget for their duration; 
              - 
    Cost-cutting measures implemented by the DoD, such as the  Better Buying Power" initiative, to ensure more efficient use of its resources in order to sufficiently fund its highest priorities;  
              - 
    Priorities of the Administration and the Congress, including but not limited to deficit reduction, which could result in changes in the overall DoD budget and various allocations within the DoD budget; and 
              - 
    The overall health of the U.S. and world economies and the state of governmental finances. 
       
  Although future defense spending levels are uncertain due to the BCA, among other factors, we expect the DoD to continue to prioritize and protect the key capabilities required to execute its strategy, including ISR, cybersecurity, missile defense, electronic warfare, unmanned systems, special operations forces and interoperability with allied forces. We believe those priorities are well aligned with our product offerings, technologies, services and capabilities.

           Table of Contents  

   With respect to other domestic customers beyond the DoD, we have contracts with a wide range of U.S. Government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Department of State, the Department of Energy, the Intelligence Community, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Similar to the budget environment for the DoD, we expect the Administration to take the spending limits imposed by the BCA into account when determining spending priorities for these agencies. Our relationship with these agencies generally is determined more by specific program requirements than by a direct correlation to the overall funding levels for these agencies; however, further changes in government spending priorities may adversely impact these specific programs. We also have contracts with various state and local government agencies that also are subject to budget constraints and conflicts in spending priorities. 
    
  We currently are involved in over   15,000   contracts, with no single contract accounting for more than   5%   of our total net sales in   2014  . Although we believe our diverse portfolio of programs and capabilities is well suited to a changing defense environment, we face numerous challenges and risks, as discussed above. For more information on the risks and uncertainties that could impact the U.S. Government's demand for our products and services, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
    
  International Considerations 
  In   2014  , our sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for   29%   of our total net sales (including foreign military sales through the U.S. Government). Internationally, the growing threat of additional terrorist activity, cyber threats, emerging nuclear states, long-range missiles and conventional military threats have led to an increase in demand for defense systems and services and other security solutions. In North Asia, both short- and long-term regional security concerns are increasing demand for air and missile defense, air/naval modernization, and maritime security. In the Middle East and North Africa, threats from state and emerging non-state actors are increasing demand for air and missile defense, air/land/naval force modernization, precision engagement, ISR, maritime and border security, and cybersecurity solutions. Given such threat environments, we expect our customers to continue to prioritize security investments even if their budgets are impacted by volatile short-term energy prices. In South and Central America, economic growth in certain developing countries is being accompanied by an increase in defense spending. While this region has traditionally been a smaller market for U.S.-based defense contractors, defense spending in such region is likely to grow at rates faster than those of other regions in the future and attract more U.S.-based suppliers. In Europe, nations continue to manage downward pressure on defense spending as their governments grapple with regional economic challenges and reprioritize accordingly. While these economic challenges may continue to restrain and even reduce the defense budgets of certain European nations, others have made commitments to increase spending in response to recent geopolitical events and conflicts in Eastern Europe and the resulting uncertainty and security threat environment. Based on the foregoing, we expect that European nations will continue to seek advanced air and missile defense capabilities. Overall, we believe many international defense budgets have the potential to grow and to do so at a faster rate than the U.S. defense budget. 
    
  International customers have and are expected to continue to adopt defense modernization initiatives similar to the DoD. We believe this trend will continue as many international customers are facing threat environments similar to that of the U.S. and they are looking for advanced weapons and sensor systems. Alliance members also wish to assure their forces and systems will be interoperable with U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces. However, international demand is sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers and geopolitical uncertainties, which may be driven by changes in threat environments, volatility in worldwide economic conditions, regional and local economic and political factors, U.S. foreign policy and other risks and uncertainties. For more information on the risks and uncertainties that could impact international demand for our products and services, see Item 1A  Risk Factors  of this Form 10-K. 
    
  Our Strategy 
  The following are the broad elements of our strategy: 
             
    Build upon our areas of strength within our key mission areas; 
                
    Focus additional resources on emerging opportunities within the Department of Defense market; 
                
    Engage key countries as individual markets with multiple customers; and 
                
    Extend Raytheon's advanced cyber solutions beyond the U.S. Government into international and commercial markets. 
       
  Our Capabilities 
  We believe that our broad mix of technologies, domain expertise and key capabilities, our cost-effective, best-value solutions and the alignment of these strengths with customer needs position us favorably to grow and increase share in our  

31 

           Table of Contents  

   core markets. Our core markets also serve as a solid base from which to expand into growth areas, such as cybersecurity, key mission areas and new customer relationships. We continually explore opportunities to leverage our existing capabilities, or develop or acquire additional ones, to expand into growth markets.  
    
  Sensing   Sensing encompasses technologies that acquire precise situational data across air, space, ground and underwater domains and then generate the information needed for effective battlespace decisions. Our Sensing technologies span the full electromagnetic spectrum, from traditional radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) to wideband, hyperspectral and acoustic sensors. We leverage our sensing technologies to provide a broad range of capabilities and to expand into growth markets, including multi-function sensors that can perform multiple missions for our customers.   
    
  Effects   Effects achieve specific military actions or outcomes, from small-unit force protection to theater/national missile defense. The missions may be achieved by kinetic means, electronic warfare, directed energy or information operations. Our Effects capabilities include advanced airframes and missiles, electronic warfare, multiple sensor seekers, targeting, net-enabled systems, multi-dimensional effects, and directed energy, particularly high-energy lasers. 
    
  Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (C3I)   C3I systems provide integrated real-time support to decision-makers on and off the battlefield, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. Our C3I capabilities include situational awareness, guidance and navigation systems, persistent surveillance, communications, mission planning, battle management command and control, intelligence and analysis, and integrated ground solutions. They also include similar capabilities such as command, control, communication, computers and intelligence (C4I). We expect to continue to grow our market presence in C3I and expand our knowledge management and discovery capabilities.  
    
  Mission Support   We are focused on enabling customer success through total life-cycle support that predicts customer needs, senses potential problems and proactively responds with the most appropriate solutions. Our Mission Support capabilities include technical services, system engineering, product support, logistics, training, operations and maintenance. Our training business continues to expand and we now train military, civil and commercial customers in over 80 countries and in 40 different languages.  
    
  Cyber   We continue to both enhance our capabilities in the cyber market and leverage the capabilities of the fourteen cyber acquisitions made since 2007. We provide cyber capabilities to the Intelligence Community, the DoD, other defense and civil global customers, and commercial markets. In addition, we embed information assurance capabilities in our products and our IT infrastructure. In 2014, we acquired Blackbird Technologies, a leading provider of persistent surveillance, secure tactical communications and cybersecurity solutions to the Intelligence Community and special operations market. We believe cyber is a strong growth market, offering Raytheon the potential to leverage our extensive capabilities, to enhance existing customer relationships, to develop new customer relationships, and to grow and scale our cyber business. 
    
  Key Mission Areas   We emphasize our capabilities in key mission areas of enduring importance to our customers. These key mission areas include missile defense, ISR and electronic warfare. In a budget-constrained domestic environment, customers are increasingly seeking cost-effective mission solutions. These solutions can take the form of new electronics or electronic upgrades, but draw on our market focus area capabilities, deep domain expertise and system architecture skills. We continue to explore opportunities to make these affordable solutions more readily available to our international customers, including through enhanced design for export and releasability. 
    
  International Growth 
  Because of the breadth of our offerings, our systems integration capability, the value of our solutions and our strong legacy in the international marketplace, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our international business. As discussed under  International Considerations,  we believe demand continues to grow for solutions in air and missile defense, precision engagement, naval systems integration, ISR, and cybersecurity. As a result we continue to enhance our focus on global growth through increased investment in our offered solutions in existing and new international markets. Such investment includes the allocation of additional time and resources for in-country development in connection with existing, and in pursuit of new, opportunities. In addition, as coalition forces increasingly integrate military operations worldwide, we believe that our capabilities in network-enabled operations will continue to be a key discriminator in these markets. Although we believe our international business is well positioned to continue to grow, we recognize that we face  

32 

           Table of Contents  

   substantial competition from both U.S. companies and other competitors in international markets as well as the challenge of changing budget priorities, overall spending pressures and the timing of contract awards.   

(1) 
    Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. Government. 
       
  Focus on the Customer and Execution 
  Our customer focus continues to be a critical part of our strategy underpinned by a focus on performance, relationships and solutions. Performance means being able to meet customer commitments which is ensured through strong processes, metrics and oversight. We maintain a  process architecture  that spans our four businesses and our broad programs and pursuits. It consists of enterprise-wide processes and systems such as our Integrated Product Development System (IPDS), which assures consistency of evaluation and execution at each step in a program's life-cycle; Product Data Management (PDM), which is our business system software for engineering; Achieving Process Excellence (APEX), which is our SAP business system software for accounting, finance and program management; Process Re-Invention Integrating Systems for Manufacturing (PRISM), which is our SAP software for manufacturing operations; Advanced Company Estimating System (ACES), which is our cost proposal system; and Raytheon Enterprise Supplier Assessment (RESA) tool for Supply Chain Management. These processes and systems are linked to an array of front-end and back-end metrics. With this structure, we are able to track results and be alerted to potential issues through numerous oversight mechanisms, including operating reviews and annual operating plan reviews.  
    
  We are also continuing to build strong customer relationships by working with them as partners and including them on Raytheon Six Sigma   TM    teams to jointly improve their programs and processes. We are increasingly focused on responding to our customers' changing requirements with rapid and effective solutions to real-world problems. In recognition of our customers' constraints and priorities, we also continue to drive various cost reductions across the Company by continuing to focus on enterprise collaboration and improving productivity and strong execution throughout our programs. We have worked to reduce costs across the Company, improve efficiencies in our production facilities, and continue to increase value through Raytheon Six Sigma   TM   , the implementation of lean processes, reduced cycle times and strategic supply chain initiatives, in addition to other initiatives. 
    
    FINANCIAL SUMMARY 
  We use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations: 
             
    Bookings   a forward-looking metric that measures the value of firm orders awarded to us during the year; 
                
    Net Sales   a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year; 
                
    Operating Income   a measure of our profit from continuing operations for the year, before non-operating expenses, net and taxes; and 
                
    Operating Margin   a measure of our operating income as a percentage of total net sales. 

We also focus on earnings per share (EPS), including Adjusted EPS, and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow (FCF) and return on invested capital (ROIC). 

33 

           Table of Contents  

   Considered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareholder value. We feel these measures are balanced among long-term and short-term performance, efficiency and growth. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. 
    
  In addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash.   We pursue a capital deployment strategy that balances funding for growing our business, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development; prudently managing our balance sheet, including debt repayments and pension contributions; and returning cash to our shareholders, including dividend payments and share repurchases  . 
    
  Backlog represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally converts into sales as we incur costs under the related contractual commitments. Therefore, we discuss changes in backlog, including any significant cancellations, for each of our segments, as we believe such discussion provides an understanding of the awarded but not executed portions of our contracts.  
    
  A discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Consolidated Results of Operations; Segment Results; Financial Condition and Liquidity; and Capital Resources. 
    
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  Our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty; therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the estimates set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting estimates and represent the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate. However, if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  We determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract or arrangement entered into with our customers. The significant estimates we make in recognizing revenue for the types of revenue-generating activities in which we are involved are described below. We classify contract revenues as product or service according to the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts unless the contract can clearly be split between product and service. We define service revenue as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development or production of tangible assets, the delivery of software code or a specific capability. Our service revenue is primarily related to our IIS business segment. 
    
  Percentage-of-Completion Accounting     We use the percentage-of-completion accounting method to account for our long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, such as certain cost-plus service contracts. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the long-term contract.     Our analysis of these contracts also contemplates whether contracts should be combined or segmented in accordance with the applicable criteria under GAAP. We combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under GAAP are met. The combination of two or more contracts requires judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single project, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if the applicable criteria under GAAP are met. Judgment also is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segmented based on how the arrangement was negotiated and the performance criteria. The decision to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period.  
    
  The selection of the method by which to measure progress towards completion of a contract also requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our long-term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress towards completion of the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Contract costs include labor,  

34 

           Table of Contents  

   materials and subcontractors costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion (the process for which we describe below in more detail) is complex and subject to many variables. Incentive and award fees generally are awarded at the discretion of the customer or upon achievement of certain program milestones or cost targets. Incentive and award fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance, which may include the performance of subcontractors or partners depending on the individual contract requirements. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event generally are not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated.    
    
  We have a Company-wide standard and disciplined quarterly Estimate at Completion (EAC)   process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities include management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (e.g., to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and related support cost allocations), performance by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, and overhead cost rates, among other variables. These estimates also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset obligations, required under certain contracts. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustments to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual contracts, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of those contracts or realizing related opportunities. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks or realizing related     opportunities. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized quarterly on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts.     When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined.  
    
  Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: 

Other Revenue Methods     To a much lesser extent, we enter into other types of contracts such as service, commercial, or software and licensing arrangements. Revenue under fixed-price service contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment, and under commercial contracts, generally is recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Costs on fixed-price service contracts are expensed as incurred, unless they otherwise qualify for deferral.   There were no costs deferred on fixed price service contracts at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  .   We recognize revenue on contracts to sell software when evidence of an arrangement exists, the software has been delivered and accepted by the customer, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. For software arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and undelivered items (e.g., maintenance and/or services; subscriptions/term licenses), we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize revenue on the perpetual license using the residual method. We base VSOE of each element on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered  

35 

           Table of Contents  

   elements based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the applicable performance period. Revenue from non-software license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Additionally, royalty revenue is recognized when earned.  
  We apply the separation guidance under GAAP for contracts with multiple deliverables. We analyze revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine if the deliverables should be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices, which we determine based on prices of the deliverables as sold on a stand-alone basis, or if not sold on a stand-alone basis, the prices we would charge if sold on a stand-alone basis. We recognize revenue for each deliverable based on the revenue recognition policies described above. 
    
  Other Considerations   The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs are unallowable. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. Government that address the allowability and allocation of costs to contracts for specific matters. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our U.S. Government contracts are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income taxes, workers  compensation and certain other accruals. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. 
    
  Pension and other postretirement benefits costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The CAS requirements for pension and other postretirement benefits costs differ from the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under GAAP. Given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS income or expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity, and therefore did not defer any FAS expense for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in   2012     2014  . This resulted in   $286 million     of income, and     $249 million   and   $255 million   of   expense   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively, reflected in our consolidated results of operations as the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension and other postretirement benefits plans in those years. 
    
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Costs 
  We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. We must calculate our pension and other postretirement benefits (PRB) costs under both CAS and FAS requirements under GAAP, and both calculations require judgment. GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not indicative of the funding requirements for pension and PRB plans that we determine under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). CAS prescribes the allocation to and recovery of pension and PRB costs on U.S. Government contracts. The CAS requirements for pension costs and its calculation methodology differ from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. As a result, while both CAS and FAS use long-term assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of pension and PRB cost. In addition, we are subject to the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), which amended ERISA. Under the PPA, we are required to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the PPA calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities.  
    
  On December 27, 2011, the CAS Pension Harmonization Rule (CAS Harmonization) was published in the Federal Register. The rule impacts pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and was effective for forward pricing purposes since February 27, 2012. The rule intends to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under CAS and the pension funding requirements under the PPA. The rule shortened the CAS amortization period for gains and losses from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, consistent

   with PPA, to measure liabilities in determining the CAS pension expense. While the change in amortization period was applicable in 2013, there is a transition period for the impact of the change in liability measurement method of 0% in 2013, 25% in 2014, 50% in 2015, 75% in 2016 and 100% in 2017. CAS Harmonization increases pension costs under CAS and increases the FAS/CAS Adjustment to income in 2014 and beyond primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the rule. Because the pension cost increases occur primarily in 2014 and beyond, the impact to our contracts in existence prior to February 27, 2012 was not material. Furthermore, because CAS Harmonization is a mandatory change in cost accounting for government contractors, we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for some portion of the increase in costs on contracts which we are currently negotiating with the government. 
    
  In July 2012, the Surface Transportation Extension Act, which is also referred to as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (STE Act), was passed by Congress and signed by the President. The STE Act includes a provision for temporary pension funding relief due to the low interest rate environment. The provision adjusts the 24-month average high quality corporate bond rates used to determine the PPA funded status so that they are within a floor and cap, or  corridor,  based on the 25-year average of corporate bond rates. The STE Act gradually phases out this interest rate provision beginning in 2013. In August 2014, the pension provisions of the STE Act were extended as part of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA). As a result, the interest rates used to determine PPA funded status will continue to be adjusted within a  corridor  and do not begin to phase out until 2018. The HATFA impacts CAS expense as well because CAS Harmonization incorporates the PPA interest rate into CAS calculations.    
    
  We record CAS expense in our business segment results. Due to the differences between FAS and CAS amounts, we also present the difference between FAS and CAS expense, referred to as our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, which is a component of our total FAS/CAS Adjustment, disclosed as a separate line item in our segment results. This effectively increases or decreases the amount of total pension expense in our results of operations so that such amount is equal to the FAS expense amount under GAAP. Due to the foregoing differences in requirements and calculation methodologies, our FAS pension expense or income is not indicative of the funding requirements or amount of government recovery. 
    
  The assumptions in the calculations of our pension FAS expense and CAS expense, which involve significant judgment, are described below. 
    
  FAS Expense   Our long-term return on plan assets (ROA) and discount rate assumptions are the key variables in determining pension expense or income and the funded status of our pension plans under GAAP. 
    
  The long-term ROA represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. The long-term ROA used to calculate net periodic pension cost is set annually at the beginning of each year. Given the long-term nature of the ROA assumption, which we believe should not be solely reactive to short-term market conditions that may not persist, we expect the long-term ROA to remain unchanged unless there are significant changes in our investment strategy, the underlying economic assumptions, or other major factors. To establish our long-term ROA assumption, we employ a  building block  approach. As part of our annual process for determining whether it is appropriate to change our long-term ROA assumption, we first review the existing long-term ROA assumption against a statistically determined reasonable range of outcomes. For purposes of determining the long-term ROA assumption for 2014 and prior, we considered this range to be between the 25th and 75th percentile likelihood of achieving a long-term return over future years (consistent with Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 27 in effect at the time). Therefore, it is less than 25 percent likely that the long-term return of the pension plan would fall below or above the 25th and 75th percentiles points, respectively (i.e., it is 50 percent likely that the long-term return of the pension plan will be within the 25th and 75th percentile range). The building block approach and the reasonable range of outcomes are based upon our asset allocation assumptions and long-term capital market assumptions. Such assumptions incorporate the economic outlook for various asset classes over short- and long-term periods and also take into consideration other factors, including historical market performance, inflation and interest rates. The reasonable range of long-term returns that was used to validate the long-term ROA assumption for the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for     2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , are shown below.

           Table of Contents  

   Our long-term domestic ROA of 8.75% fell between the 60th 65th percentile, 65th 70th percentile and 60th 65th percentile of the reasonable range for     2014  ,   2013   and   2012  ,   respectively. The 50th percentile of the reasonable range used to develop each of the     2014  ,   2013   and   2012     long-term ROA was 7.59%, 7.51% and 7.99%, respectively.     
    
  Once our long-term ROA has been determined, we review historical averages and patterns of returns to confirm reasonability of our long-term ROA assumption compared to past results. While history is not solely indicative of future market expectations, it does provide insight into general historical trends and long-term asset performance. In validating the     2014     long-term ROA assumption, we reviewed our pension plan asset performance since 1986. Our average annual actual rate of return since 1986 of 9.19%, determined on an arithmetic basis, exceeds our estimated 8.75% assumed return. Arithmetic annual averages represent the simple average returns over independent annual periods, whereas geometric returns reflect the compound average returns of dependent annual periods. The average annual actual return on a geometric basis for the same period was 8.50%. In addition, the actual annual returns have exceeded our long-term ROA assumption of 8.75% in six of the past ten years. Because our 2014 long-term ROA assumption of 8.75% for our domestic pension plans was within the reasonable range and our historical trends and averages did not indicate a trend or pattern of returns significantly above or below our existing assumption, we determined our long-term ROA assumption for our domestic pension plans in     2014     would remain at 8.75%, consistent with our     2013     assumption. 
    
  In September 2013, the Actuarial Standards Board issued a revision to the Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 27, Selection of Economic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations (ASOP 27), that replaced the explicit reference to the best estimate range concept with the selection of a reasonable assumption that considers multiple criteria including the purposes of measurement, the actuary s professional judgment, historical and current economic data and estimates of future experience and has no significant bias. The revised standard is effective for assumptions established on or after September 30, 2014. As a result of the revised standard, we continue to evaluate our long-term ROA assumption against a reasonable range of possible outcomes but have modified that range to be between the 35th to 65th percentile likelihood of achieving a long-term return over future years. We believe that continuing to validate our ROA assumption within a reasonable range that is narrowed to the 35th to 65th percentiles ensures an unbiased result while also ensuring that the ROA assumption is not solely reactive to short-term market conditions that may not persist, and is consistent with external actuarial practices.  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we reduced our long-term target allocation for equities and increased our target allocation for fixed income within the investment policy allocations established by our Investment Committee in order to reduce the overall exposure to equity volatility. This change in asset allocation reduced the range of reasonable outcomes that we use to evaluate our long-term ROA assumption and we determined that the historical assumption of 8.75% no longer fell within this range. To develop our 2015 long-term ROA assumption, we employed a building block approach. Under this building block method, the overall expected investment return equals the weighted average of the individual expected return for each asset class based on the target asset allocation and the long-term capital market assumptions. The expected return for each asset class is composed of inflation plus a risk-free rate of return, plus an expected risk premium for that asset class. The resulting return is then adjusted for administrative, investment management and trading expenses as well as recognition of alpha for active management. The building block approach resulted in a long-term ROA assumption of 8.0% for 2015. To validate this assumption we compared the result against the reasonable range of outcomes and confirmed that the 8.0% result falls between the 55th and 60th percentile of the reasonable range for 2015 with the 50th percentile at 7.37%. We also assessed this result against an approximation of what our historical asset performance may have been since 1986 using the updated target allocation and have concluded that the average return would likely have been equal to or greater than 8.0% for that time period. Based upon our application of the building block approach and our review of the resulting assumption against the 35th to 65th reasonable range, and an analysis of our historical results, we have established a 2015 long-term ROA assumption of 8.0% and have determined that the new assumption is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of ASOP 27. If we significantly change our long-term investment allocation or strategy, or if there is a significant change in the economic assumptions, then our long-term ROA assumption could change in the future.  
    
  Our domestic pension plans  actual rates of return were approximately 6%, 15% and 12% for     2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The difference between the actual rate of return and our long-term ROA assumption is included in deferred losses.

   The investment policy asset allocation ranges for our domestic pension plans, as set by our Investment Committee, for the year ended December 31,   2014   were as follows:    

Our long-term ROA assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans are based on the asset allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of our Pension Benefits plans. 
    
  The discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate assumption is determined by using a theoretical bond portfolio model consisting of bonds rated AA or better by Moody s for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated benefit payments for each of our pension plans. The discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans at December 31,   2014   is 4.08%, which represents a weighted-average discount rate across our plans, compared to the December 31,   2013   discount rate of 5.08% as a result of the bond environment at December 31, 2014. 
    
  CAS Expense   In addition to providing the methodology for calculating pension costs, CAS also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. The key drivers of CAS pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate CAS reimbursement for each of our plans. Under the prior CAS rules, the discount rate used to measure liabilities was required to be consistent with the long-term ROA assumption, which changes infrequently given its long-term nature. In addition to certain other changes, CAS Harmonization requires contractors to compare the liability under the prior CAS methodology and assumptions to a liability using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, and use the greater of the two liability calculations in developing CAS expense. In addition, unlike FAS, we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under CAS until such plan is fully funded as determined under CAS requirements. When the estimated future CAS pension costs increase, the estimated CAS cost allocated to our contracts in the future increases. 
    
  Other FAS and CAS Considerations   An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had the following approximate impacts on   2014   FAS pension results:

Changes in the high-quality corporate bond rate assumption could impact the CAS discount rate for purposes of determining CAS pension expense due to CAS Harmonization. However in   2014  , the CAS pension expense was not impacted by this assumption due to the passage of HATFA which extended the provisions of pension funding relief as described above. The discount rate assumption will impact CAS pension expense in future periods as the provisions of HATFA phase out.

   An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the long-term ROA assumption would have had the following approximate impacts on   2014   FAS and CAS pension results: 

A 25 basis point increase or decrease in our long-term ROA assumption would result in a decrease or increase to our FAS pension expense by approximately   $45 million   for 2014. In addition to the impact on our 2014 FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, a portion of the   $31 million   change in CAS pension expense would also be allocated to fixed price contracts in backlog and would either increase or decrease the profit rate on those contracts at the time of such a change (i.e., a change in the long-term ROA assumption on January 1, 2014 would drive a change in estimated costs in EACs and related contract profit rates as of December 31, 2013). The contract impact resulting from the change in CAS pension expense is difficult to estimate because remaining performance periods can vary, the amount and timing of expected new awards (i.e., the proposals expected to be awarded in the year which will bear their allocated portion of the change in CAS pension expense), and our mix of fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts can change. Based on our contract profile at December 31, 2014, if we had 60 percent of our backlog in fixed price contracts, and they were on average 50 percent complete, with our actual new award profile for 2014, a 25 basis point change in our long-term ROA assumption at January 1, 2014 would drive approximately $7 million of aggregate total EAC adjustments at December 31, 2013. In addition, our fixed price contracts in backlog as of December 31, 2013 would have a lower profit rate in 2014, resulting in approximately $4 million impact as costs are incurred in that year on those contracts. The total impact on 2013 would be approximately $7 million driven by the aggregate EAC adjustments and the total impact on 2014 would be approximately $18 million (the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment and the lower profit rate impact in 2014 on fixed price contracts in backlog at December 31, 2013). A change in our long-term ROA assumption would be subject to review by our government customer for reasonableness. Given our history of recovering changes to CAS pension expense, we expect the assumption change would be allocable and allowable, per regulatory guidelines, as long as the assumption is reasonable. The transition to CAS Harmonization may gradually reduce the impact that a change to the long-term ROA assumption will have on CAS pension expense in future years as CAS Harmonization is phased in (as discussed in more detail under the CAS Expense section above). 
    
  The impact of changing our long-term ROA for our domestic pension plans from 8.75% to 8.0% in 2015 is expected to increase our FAS expense by $140 million, increase our CAS expense by $40 million and decrease our FAS/CAS pension adjustment to income by $100 million in 2015. This CAS impact to 2015 varies from the theoretical impact to 2014 described above because the CAS impact in any one year depends on the actual change in the long-term ROA and is not linear. The CAS impact is primarily driven by whether the pre-CAS Harmonization methodology applies, which uses a discount rate based on the long-term ROA assumption, or the post-CAS Harmonization methodology applies, which uses a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, and the corresponding relationship between the long-term ROA and the high-quality corporate bond rate. In addition, the timing of the change relative to the transition period for CAS Harmonization affects the CAS impact. The $40 million increase in our CAS expense in 2015 was included in our EACs and did not have a significant impact on our 2014 results based on our overall ending overhead positions. 
    
  In accordance with both FAS and CAS, a calculated  market-related value  of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is determined using actual asset gains or losses over a certain prior period (three years for FAS and five years for CAS, subject to certain limitations under CAS on the difference between the market-related value and actual market value of assets). Because of this difference in the number of years over which actual asset gains or losses are recognized and subsequently amortized, FAS expense generally tends to reflect recent asset gains or losses faster than CAS. Another driver of CAS expense (but not FAS expense) is the funded status of our pension plans under CAS. As noted above, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded; consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. 
    
  Under FAS,   a  corridor  approach may be elected and applied in the recognition of asset and liability gains or losses which limits expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10 percent of the projected  

40 

           Table of Contents  

   benefit obligation or the calculated "market-related value" of assets. We do not use a  corridor  approach in the calculation of FAS expense.      
  For   2015   compared to   2014  ,   we currently expect our FAS expense to increase more than our CAS expense resulting in a lower FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to income. We expect the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to be approximately   $200 million     of income driven by the differences in the assumptions and the recognition period for gains and losses under FAS and CAS and CAS Harmonization and the impact of the change in our long-term ROA assumption, as described above. This expected increase in FAS and CAS expense is subject to our annual update, generally planned in the third quarter, of our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for both FAS and CAS for final census data. After 2015, the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment is more difficult to predict because future FAS and CAS expense is based on a number of key assumptions for future periods. Differences between those assumptions and future actual results could significantly change both FAS and CAS expense in future periods. However, based solely on our current assumptions at December 31, 2014 and taking into account CAS Harmonization, which increases CAS expense in 2014 and beyond, we would expect our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to increase income in 2016. 
    
  Our pension and other postretirement benefits plans  investments are stated at fair value. Investments in equity securities (common and preferred) are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. Investments in fixed-income securities are generally valued using methods based upon market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are generally recognized by institutional traders. Investments in private equity and private real estate funds are estimated at fair market value, which primarily utilizes net asset values reported by the investment manager or fund administrator. We review independently appraised values, audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the net asset values. For the limited group of securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value, additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value.  
    
  The change in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans was as follows: 

The balance in AOCL related to our pension and other postretirement benefits plans is composed primarily of differences between changes in discount rates, differences between actual and expected asset returns, differences between actual and assumed demographic experience, and changes in plan provisions. Changes to our pension and other postretirement benefits obligation as a result of these variables are initially reflected in other comprehensive income. The deferred gains and losses are amortized and included in future pension expense over the average employee service period of approximately   10   years at   December 31, 2014  . The   $4.4 billion   in   2014   losses arising during the period were driven primarily by the decrease in the discount rate from   5.08%   at   December 31, 2013   to   4.08%   at   December 31, 2014  , which had an impact of approximately $3.0 billion, and actual returns, which were lower than our expected return and had an impact of approximately $0.3 billion, as well as other actuarial factors including mortality. The mortality assumption is the basis for determining the longevity of our pension participants and the expected period over which they will receive pension benefits. A recent study released by the Society of Actuaries indicated that life expectancies have increased over the past several years and are longer than what was assumed by most existing mortality tables. Our pension obligation as of December 31, 2014 reflects a change in the underlying mortality assumption, which reflects improvements in life expectancy consistent with the Society of Actuaries study. Our pension obligation also reflects an increase in the expected rate of future longevity improvement taking into consideration data from multiple sources including the Society of Actuaries study and Social Security Administration data. These changes resulted in an increase in our projected benefit obligation of $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2014. The   $3.0 billion   in   2013   gains arising during the period were driven primarily by the increase in the discount rate from   4.15%   at December 31,   2012   to   5.08%   at   December 31, 2013  , which had an impact of approximately $2.4 billion and actual returns, which were higher than our expected return, which had an impact of approximately $1.1 billion partially offset by other actuarial factors. The   $2.2 billion   in   2012   losses arising  

41 

           Table of Contents  

   during the period were driven primarily by the decrease in the discount rate from 5.00% at December 31,   2011   to   4.15%   at   December 31, 2012  , which had an impact of approximately $2.0 billion. 
    
  Impairment of Goodwill 
  We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter and in any interim period in which circumstances arise that indicate our goodwill may be impaired. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant decreases in federal government appropriations or funding for our contracts, or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. We performed an interim goodwill impairment test and there was no indication of impairment. No events occurred during the periods presented that indicated the existence of an impairment with respect to our goodwill. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on our most recent long-range plan in place at the time of our impairment testing, and compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. We discount the cash flow forecasts using the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. The weighted-average cost of capital is comprised of the estimated required rate of return on equity, based on publicly available data for peer companies, plus an equity risk premium related to specific company risk factors, and the after-tax rate of return on debt, weighted at the relative values of the estimated debt and equity for the industry. Preparation of forecasts for use in the long-range plan and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Significant changes in these forecasts or the discount rate selected could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. When available and as appropriate, we also use comparative market multiples to corroborate our DCF model results. There was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of our   2014   annual impairment analysis, as the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, including goodwill. Based on our   2014   impairment analysis, the reporting unit that was closest to impairment had a fair value in excess of net book value, including goodwill, of approximately   55%  . All other factors being equal, a 10% decrease in expected future cash flows for that reporting unit would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 40%. Alternatively, all other factors being equal, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of that reporting unit would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 35%. If we are required to record an impairment charge in the future, it could materially affect our results of operations.  
    
    CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
    
    Total Net Sales 
  The composition of external net sales by products and services for each segment in   2014   was approximately the following: 

Total Net Sales -   2014   vs.   2013   The   decrease   in total net sales of   $880 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to lower external net sales of   $404 million   at IDS and   $267 million   at MS. The decrease in external net sales at IDS was primarily due to   lower net sales     from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on various Patriot programs for international customers  , lower net sales   on a close combat tactical radar program due to planned decreases in production   and lower net sales   on a missile defense radar program for an international customer also due to planned decreases in production  . The   decrease   in external net sales at IDS was   partially offset by     higher net sales from an international air defense system program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013  ,   higher net sales from an international  

42 

           Table of Contents  

   Patriot program awarded in the first quarter of 2014 and     higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014 driven primarily by previously deferred precontract costs  .   The remaining decrease   at IDS   was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.   The decrease in external net sales at MS was   primarily due to     lower net sales on land warfare systems programs driven principally by planned declines in production due to the U.S. Army budget environment  . 
    
  Products and Services Net Sales -   2014   vs.   2013   The   decrease   in products net sales of   $729 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to lower external products net sales of   $403 million   at IDS and   $263 million   at MS, both driven principally by the programs described above. The decrease in services net sales of   $151 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to lower external services net sales at IIS of   $111 million  , driven principally by   lower net sales     on training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities resulting from a decrease in customer-determined activity levels  . 
    
  Total Net Sales -   2013   vs.   2012   The   decrease   in total net sales of   $708 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to lower external net sales of   $324 million   at SAS and   $323 million   at IIS. The   decrease   in external net sales at SAS was primarily due to   lower net sales     on certain classified programs and     on certain intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance programs due to reduced program requirements.   The   decrease   in external net sales at IIS was primarily due to   lower net sales     on classified programs, lower net sales     on training programs supporting the U.S. Army s Warfighter FOCUS activities due to a decrease in customer determined activity levels, and lower net sales     on the National Science Foundation (NSF) Polar program, which was completed in the first quarter of 2012. 
    
  Products and Services Net Sales -   2013   vs.   2012   The   decrease   in products net sales of   $525 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to lower external products net sales of   $306 million   at SAS, principally driven by the programs and for the reasons described above. The decrease in services net sales of   $183 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to lower external services net sales of   $207 million   at IIS, principally driven by the training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities and the NSF Polar program described above. 
    
  Sales to Major Customers   The following is a breakdown of net sales to major customers: 

(1) 
    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. Government. 
              (2) 
    Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. Government. 
       
  As described above in Industry Considerations, U.S. defense spending levels are difficult to predict due to numerous factors, including U.S. Government budget appropriation decisions, geopolitical events and macroeconomic conditions. 
    
    Total Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists of labor, materials and subcontractors costs, as well as related allocated costs. For each of our contracts, we manage the nature and amount of direct costs at the contract level, and manage indirect costs through cost pools as required by government accounting regulations. The estimate of the actual amount of direct and indirect costs forms the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of the contract.

Total Cost of Sales -   2014   vs.   2013   The   decrease   in total cost of sales of   $1,237 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to a   $535 million   change in the FAS/CAS Adjustment and lower external cost of sales of   $271 million   at MS and   $233 million   at IDS. The change in the FAS/CAS Adjustment was primarily driven by a   $345 million     decrease   in our FAS pension expense and by a   $189 million     increase   in our CAS pension expense, which is included in the results of each segment and generally recovered through pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. The changes in both our FAS expense and CAS expense are described in our Segment Results beginning on page   49  . The decreases in external cost of sales at MS and IDS were driven principally by the activity on the programs described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
  Products and Services Cost of Sales -   2014   vs.   2013    The   decrease   in products cost of sales of   $1,032 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   $441 million   of lower expense related to the FAS/CAS Adjustment described above and lower external products cost of sales of   $272 million   at MS and   $229 million   at IDS. The decreases in external products cost of sales at MS and IDS were principally driven by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in services cost of sales of   $205 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   $94 million   of lower expense related to the FAS/CAS Adjustment described above and lower external services cost of sales of   $81 million   at IIS, principally driven by activity on training programs supporting the U.S. Army's Warfighter FOCUS activities due to a decrease in customer-determined activity levels. 
    
  Total Cost of Sales -   2013   vs.   2012   The   decrease   in total cost of sales of   $560 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to lower external cost of sales of $264 million at IIS and $232 million at SAS, both primarily due to the activity on the programs and for the reasons described above in Total Net Sales.  
    
  Products and Services Cost of Sales -   2013   vs.   2012   The decrease in products cost of sales of   $420 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to lower external products cost of sales of   $197 million   at SAS and   $141 million   at IDS. The decrease in external products cost of sales at SAS was primarily due to the activity on the programs and for the reasons described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in external products cost of sales at IDS was primarily due to   the scheduled completion of certain production phases on an international Patriot program awarded in the first quarter of 2008  , partially   offset by higher   external products cost of sales   on other integrated air and missile defense programs for international and domestic customers, driven principally by scheduled program production requirements and timing of new awards, and higher   external products cost of sales   on a missile defense radar program for an international customer driven principally by scheduled program production requirements. The remaining change in   external products costs of sales at IDS   was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.   The decrease in services cost of sales of   $140 million   in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower external services cost of sales of   $175 million   at IIS, driven principally by activity on the programs and for the reasons described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
    General and Administrative Expenses 

The   increase   in administrative and selling expenses of   $81 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   includes the   $25 million   of stock compensation expense associated with RSUs issued in 2014 as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   49  . There was no other individual or common significant driver of the increase in administrative and selling expenses.

           Table of Contents  

   The   decrease   in administrative and selling expenses of   $111 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to a   $36 million   decrease in net state taxes allocated to our contracts, $34 million driven by the timing of bid and proposal expenses on various contract pursuits, and a $17 million decrease in marketing and selling expenses. 
    
  Included in administrative and selling expenses is the provision for state income taxes, which generally can be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. Government. Net state income taxes allocated to our contracts were   $41 million  ,   $42 million   and   $78 million   in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  The   increase   in research and development expenses of   $35 million   in   2014   compared to 2013 was primarily due to   higher independent research and development activity related to electronic warfare technology  . Research and development expenses in   2013   were relatively consistent in amount and as a percentage of total net sales with   2012  . 
    
  Total Operating Expenses 

The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $1,121 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the   decrease     in total cost of sales of   $1,237 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Cost of Sales. 
    
  The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $657 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the   decrease   in total cost of sales of   $560 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Cost of Sales. 
    
    Operating Income 

The   increase   in operating income of   $241 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was due to the   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $1,121 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Operating Expenses, offset by the   decrease   in total net sales of   $880 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Net Sales. 
    
  The   decrease   in operating income of   $51 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was due to the   decrease   in total net sales of   $708 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Net Sales, offset by the   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $657 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Operating Expenses. 
    
    Total Non-Operating (Income) Expense, Net 

The   increase   in total non-operating (income) expense, net of   $15 million   in   2014   compared to   2013  , was primarily due to a $10 million change in the fair value of marketable securities held in trust associated with certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, due to net gains of $11 million in   2014   compared to a net gains of $21 million in   2013  . 
    
  The   decrease   in total non-operating (income) expense, net of   $29 million   in   2013   compared to   2012  , was primarily due to the   $29 million   pretax charge associated with the make-whole provision on the early repurchase of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2012.

   Federal and Foreign Income Taxes 

The   decrease   in federal and foreign income taxes of   $18 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the tax benefit of the foreign dividend described below, offset by an increase in annual business income. The   decrease   in federal and foreign income taxes of   $70 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to timing of the settlement related to the 2006 2008 IRS audit examination cycle (2012 Tax Settlement). 
    
  In the first quarter of 2014, a foreign subsidiary authorized and completed a transaction which resulted in a taxable dividend of approximately   $115 million  . The transaction does not affect our indefinite reinvestment assertion because it generated a net tax benefit of approximately   $80 million  . No provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings have been indefinitely invested or are expected to be remitted substantially free of additional tax. 
    
  Our effective tax rate, which is used to determine federal and foreign income tax expense, differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following:    

Our effective tax rate reflects the   35%   U.S. statutory rate adjusted for various permanent differences between book and tax reporting. In December 2014, Congress enacted legislation that retroactively reinstated the R D tax credit for the 2014 tax year. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a full year benefit of approximately $30 million related to the 2014 R D tax credit.  
    
  During 2014, the IRS completed its examination of the 2012 tax year, which completed all IRS examinations through the 2012 tax year.   During   2013  , the IRS completed its examination of our 2009 and 2010 tax years and we received final approval from the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) of a refund claim related to the 2011 tax year. During   2012  , we received final approval from the IRS and the JCT on settlement for the 2012 Tax Settlement. 
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2014   was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefit on the foreign dividend which decreased the rate by approximately   2.8%  , the domestic manufacturing deduction which decreased the rate by approximately   2.7%  , the reinstatement of the R D tax credit which decreased the rate by approximately   1.1%   and tax settlements and refunds which decreased the rate by approximately   0.5%  . The remaining decrease of   1.4%   is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant.  
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2013   was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the domestic manufacturing deduction which decreased the rate by approximately   2.1%  , the R D tax credit which decreased the rate by approximately   1.8%  , and tax settlements and refunds which decreased the rate by approximately   0.8%  . The remaining decrease of   1.0%   is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant. 
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2012   was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the domestic manufacturing deduction which decreased the rate by approximately   1.9%   and the 2012 Tax Settlement, which decreased the rate by approximately   0.8%  . The remaining decrease of   0.7%   is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant.

             Table of Contents  

   Our effective tax rate in   2014   was   2.8%     lower   than in   2013   primarily due to the tax benefit on the foreign dividend, which decreased the rate by approximately   2.8%  , offset by the R D tax credit which increased the rate by approximately   0.7%  . The remaining decrease of 0.7% is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant. 
    
  Our effective tax rate in   2013   was   2.3%   lower than in   2012   primarily due to the reinstatement of the R D tax credit, which decreased the rate by approximately   1.8%  . The remaining decrease of 0.5% is composed of various unrelated items which individually or collectively are not significant. 
    
    Income from Continuing Operations 

The   increase   in income from continuing operations of   $244 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the   $241 million     increase   in operating income, described above in Operating Income. 
    
  The   increase   in income from continuing operations of   $48 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the   $70 million     decrease   in federal and foreign income taxes, related primarily to the change in the effective tax rate described above in Federal and Foreign Income Taxes, and the   $29 million     decrease   in total non-operating expenses, net, the primary drivers of which are described above in Total Non-Operating (Income) Expense, Net, partially offset by the   $51 million     decrease   in operating income, described above in Operating Income. 
    
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in   2014   was relatively consistent with   2013  . Included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2014 was a gain of $52 million related to the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. Government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under CAS 413 for previously divested operations as described below in Segment Results beginning on page   49  . 
    
  The   increase   in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, of   $65 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the favorable resolution of two separate tax matters related to our previously disposed commercial aircraft businesses. 
    
  Net Income 

The   increase   in net income of   $245 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the   increase   in income from continuing operations of   $244 million   described above in Income from Continuing Operations. 
    
  The   increase   in net income of   $113 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was due to the   increase   in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, of   $65 million  , the primary drivers of which are described above in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax, and the   increase   in income from continuing operations of   $48 million   described above in Income from Continuing Operations.

   Diluted Earnings per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders 

The   increase   in diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders of   $1.01   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations described above in Income from Continuing Operations. The   $0.31   increase in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which was affected by the common stock share activity shown in the table below. 
    
  Our common stock share activity for the years ended   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012   was as follows: 

Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders 
  Diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders were earnings of   $0.21   in   2014  , earnings of   $0.20   in   2013  , and a loss of less than   $0.01   in   2012  . Diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders in   2014   was relatively consistent with   2013  . The   increase   of   $0.20   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the activity described above in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax. 
    
  Diluted EPS Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders 

The   increase   in diluted EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders of   $1.02   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders of   $1.01   described above in Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders. The increase of   $0.51   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the decreases in diluted shares and the changes in Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Raytheon Company Common Stockholders described above.

   Adjusted EPS 
  Adjusted EPS was as follows:    

Adjusted EPS is diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders excluding the EPS impact of the FAS/CAS Adjustment, tax effected at the federal statutory rate of   35%  , and from time to time, certain other items. In addition to the FAS/CAS Adjustment, 2014 Adjusted EPS also excludes the EPS impact of the tax benefit related to a foreign dividend. In the first quarter of 2014, a foreign subsidiary authorized and completed a transaction which resulted in a taxable dividend of approximately $115 million and generated a net tax benefit of approximately $80 million. In addition to the FAS/CAS Adjustment, our   2013   Adjusted EPS also excludes the EPS impact of the R D tax credit that relates to   2012  . In January 2013, Congress approved legislation that included the extension of the R D tax credit. The legislation retroactively reinstated the R D tax credit for 2012 and extended it through December 31,   2013  . As a result, we recorded the   2012   benefit in the first quarter of 2013. In addition to the FAS/CAS Adjustment, our   2012   Adjusted EPS also excludes the EPS impact of the make-whole provision on the early retirement of debt and includes the favorable impact from the $25 million ($0.07 per diluted share) 2012 R D tax credit that was recorded for GAAP reporting in the first quarter of 2013. The difference between the first quarter of 2013 ($0.08 per share) and full-year 2012 ($0.07 per share) impact of the 2012 R D tax credit is due to a higher number of diluted shares for the full-year 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2013. We are providing Adjusted EPS because management uses it for the purpose of evaluating and forecasting our financial performance and believes that it provides additional insight into our underlying business performance. We believe it allows investors to benefit from being able to assess our operating performance in the context of how our principal customer, the U.S. Government, allows us to recover pension and other postretirement benefit costs and to better compare our operating performance to others in the industry on that same basis. Adjusted EPS is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and the amounts presented may not recalculate directly due to rounding. 
      
  SEGMENT RESULTS 
  We report our results in the following segments: IDS; IIS; MS; and SAS. The following provides some context for viewing our segment performance through the eyes of management. 
    
  Given the nature of our business, bookings, net sales, and operating income (and the related operating margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management s view of our segment performance, and often these measures have significant interrelated effects, as described below. In addition, we disclose and discuss backlog, which represents future sales that we expect to recognize over the remaining contract period, which is generally several years. We also disclose cost of sales and the components of cost of sales within our segment disclosures. 
    
  Bookings   We disclose the amount of bookings and notable contract awards for each segment. Bookings generally represent the dollar value of new contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. We believe bookings are an important measure of future performance and are an indicator of potential future changes in total net sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period.  
    
  Bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period, which are subject to numerous factors, including the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs; fiscal constraints placed on customer budgets; political uncertainty; the timing of customer negotiations; the timing of governmental approvals and notifications; and the timing of option exercises or increases in scope. In addition, due to these factors, quarterly bookings tend to  

49 

           Table of Contents  

   fluctuate from period to period, particularly on a segment basis. As a result, we believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods and that shorter term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend. 

Included in bookings were international bookings of   $8,362 million  ,   $6,604 million   and   $5,979 million   in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively, which included foreign military bookings through the U.S. Government. International bookings amounted to   35%  ,   30%   and   23%   of total bookings in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively. Classified bookings amounted to   15%  ,   13%   and   16%   of total bookings in   2014  ,   2013  , and   2012  , respectively.  
    
  We record bookings for not-to-exceed contract awards (e.g., undefinitized contract awards, binding letter agreements) based on reasonable estimates of expected contract definitization, which generally will not be less than 75% of the award. We subsequently adjust bookings to reflect the actual amounts definitized, or, when prior to definitization, when facts and circumstances indicate that our previously estimated amounts are no longer reasonable. The timing of awards that may cover multiple fiscal years influences the size of bookings in each year. Bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contracts), and are reduced for contract cancellations and terminations of bookings recognized in the current year. We reflect contract cancellations and terminations from prior year bookings, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. 
    
  Backlog   We disclose period-ending backlog for each segment.   Backlog represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally converts into sales as we incur costs under the related contractual commitments. Therefore, we discuss changes in backlog, including any significant cancellations, for each of our segments, as we believe such discussion provides an understanding of the awarded but not executed portions of our contracts.        

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer for which work has not been performed) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer for which work has not been performed). Revenue is generally not recognized on backlog until funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ). Both funded and unfunded backlog are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
    
  Total Net Sales   We generally express changes in net sales in terms of volume. Volume generally refers to increases or decreases in revenues related to varying amounts of total operating expenses, which are comprised of cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, which include administrative and selling expenses (including bid and proposal costs) and research and development expenses, incurred on individual contracts (i.e., from performance against contractual commitments on our bookings related to engineering, production or service activity). Therefore, we discuss volume changes attributable principally to individual programs unless there is a discrete event (e.g., a major contract termination,  

50 

           Table of Contents  

   natural disaster or major labor strike), or some other unusual item that has a material effect on changes in a segment's volume for a reported period. Due to the nature of our contracts, the amount of costs incurred and related revenues will naturally fluctuate over the lives of our contracts. As a result, in any reporting period, the changes in volume on numerous contracts are likely to be due to normal fluctuations in our engineering, production or service activities.  
    
  Total net sales by segment were as follows: 

Total Operating Expenses   We generally disclose operating expenses for each segment in terms of the following: 1) cost of sales labor; 2) cost of sales materials and subcontractors; and 3) other costs of sales and other operating expenses. Included in cost of sales labor is the incurred direct labor associated with the performance of contracts in the current period and any applicable overhead and fringe costs. Included in cost of sales materials and subcontractors is the incurred direct materials, subcontractor costs (which could include effort performed by other Raytheon segments or locations), and applicable overhead allocations in the current period. Included in other cost of sales and other operating expenses is other direct costs not captured in labor or material and subcontractor costs, such as precontract costs previously deferred, costs previously deferred into inventory on contracts using commercial or units of delivery accounting, applicable overhead allocations, general and administrative expenses, which include administrative and selling expenses (including bid and proposal costs) and research and development expenses, other direct costs (such as ancillary services and travel expenses) and adjustments for loss contracts. 
    
  Operating Income (and the related operating margin percentage)   We generally express changes in segment operating income in terms of volume, net changes in EAC adjustments or changes in contract mix and other program performance.   
    
  The impact of changes in volume on operating income excludes the impact of net EAC adjustments and the impact of changes in contract mix and other program performance and is calculated based on changes in costs on individual programs at an overall margin for the segment. 
    
  Changes in net EAC adjustments typically relate to the current period impact of revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates. We have a Company-wide standard and disciplined quarterly EAC   process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities include management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (e.g., to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and related support cost allocations), performance by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, and overhead cost rates, among other variables. These estimates also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset obligations, required under certain contracts. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustments to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual contracts, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of those contracts or realizing related opportunities. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks or realizing related     opportunities. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized quarterly on a cumulative catch-up basis, which  

51 

           Table of Contents  

   recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts.   Given that we have over   15,000   individual contracts and the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis, as discussed above, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments. We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented: 

In recent years, our net EAC adjustments generally have been between 2.0% and 2.5% of total net sales. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, our net EAC adjustments as a percentage of total net sales were   2.2%  ,   2.3%   and   2.5%  , respectively. 
    
  Included in net EAC adjustments in   2014   was an unfavorable   $38 million   adjustment from a decrease in estimated incentive fees on the Australian Air Warfare Destroyer program at IDS due to an increase in expected costs by the shipbuilder to complete its portion of the program. Also included in net EAC adjustments in 2014 were net adjustments of $36 million and $35 million at IDS on two separate contracts related to the industrial cooperation agreements for an international customer described below. There were no significant individual EAC adjustments in   2013   and   2012  .  
    
  The   $44 million   decrease in net EAC adjustments in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the decrease in net EAC adjustments at IDS as described beginning on page 53. 
    
  The   $56 million     decrease   in net EAC adjustments in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the decrease in net EAC adjustments at SAS as described beginning on page 59. 
    
  Changes in contract mix and other program performance refer to changes in operating margin due to a change in the relative volume of contracts with higher or lower fee rates such that the overall average margin rate for the segment changes and other drivers of program performance, including margin rate increases or decreases due to EAC adjustments in prior periods. A higher or lower expected fee rate at the initial award of a contract typically correlates to the contract's risk profile, which is often specifically driven by the type of customer and related procurement regulations, the type of contract (e.g., fixed price vs. cost plus), the maturity of the product or service, and the scope of work. Changes in contract mix and other performance also include all other items which are not related to volume or EAC adjustments. 
    
  Because each segment has thousands of contracts in any reporting period, changes in operating income and margin are likely to be due to normal changes in volume, net EAC adjustments, and contract mix and other performance on many contracts with no single change, or series of related changes, materially driving a segment's change in operating income or operating margin percentage.  
    
  Operating income by segment was as follows:

  Total Net Sales   The   decrease   in total net sales of   $404 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   lower net sales   of $441 million   from the scheduled completion of certain production phases on various Patriot programs for international customers  , $134 million   on a close combat tactical radar program due to planned decreases in production  , and $134 million   on a missile defense radar program for an international customer also due to planned decreases in production  . The   decrease   was   partially offset by   $203 million of   higher net sales from an international air defense system program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013  , $154 million of   higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the first quarter of 2014 and   $135 million of   higher net sales from an international Patriot program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2014 driven primarily by previously deferred precontract costs  .   The remaining decrease     was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.     
    
  Total net sales in   2013   were relatively consistent with   2012  . Included in total net sales in 2013 was $275 million of lower net sales from   the scheduled completion of certain production phases on an international Patriot program awarded in the first quarter of 2008  . The decrease was   offset by higher   net sales of $339 million   on other integrated air and missile defense

             Table of Contents  

   programs for international and domestic customers, driven principally by scheduled program production requirements and timing of new awards, and higher   net sales of $115 million   on a missile defense radar program for an international customer driven principally by scheduled program production requirements. The remaining change in   total net sales   was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.    
    
     Total Operating Expenses   The   decrease   in total operating expenses of   $263 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to a   decrease   in labor costs of   $233 million  , principally driven by the activity on the various Patriot programs for international customers and the missile defense radar program for an international customer described above in Total Net Sales, partially offset by increased labor costs on a naval radar program awarded in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
    
  Total operating expenses in   2013   were relatively consistent with   2012  .  
    
  Operating Income and Margin   The   decrease   in operating income of   $141 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was due to a net change in EAC adjustments of   $55 million  , decreased volume of   $47 million   and a change in mix and other performance of   $39 million  . The net change in EAC adjustments was primarily due to a $35 million change in net adjustments on the Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) program primarily driven by a $38 million adjustment for a decrease in estimated incentive fees in the second quarter of 2014 due to an increase in expected costs by the shipbuilder to complete their portion of the program, and a $28 million change in net adjustments on an integrated air and missile defense program driven by an increase in estimated costs due to higher expected effort than previously planned, partially offset by a $30 million change in net adjustments related to the industrial cooperation agreements for an international customer discussed below. The remaining change in net EAC adjustments was spread across numerous programs with no individual or common significant driver.  
    
  Included in net EAC adjustments was approximately $72 million in 2014 compared to $42 million in 2013 driven primarily by the reduction of expected costs to fulfill contractual commitments on nine contracts related to industrial cooperation agreements for an international customer driven by favorable experience in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. One of these contracts in the fourth quarter of 2014 had an adjustment of $36 million, driven almost entirely by the reduction of expected costs related to the industrial cooperation agreements. Another one of these contracts in the fourth quarter of 2014 had an adjustment of $35 million, of which $22 million was driven by the reduction of expected costs related to the industrial cooperation agreements and the remainder of which was driven by favorable cost performance. 
    
  The decrease in volume in   2014   compared to   2013   was driven principally by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The change in mix and other performance in   2014   compared to   2013   was principally driven by lower net sales on various Patriot programs for international customers described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in operating margin in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the net change in EAC adjustments and the change in mix and other performance. 
    
  The   increase   in operating income of   $68 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of   $88 million  , principally driven by higher net sales on certain international Patriot programs. Included in net EAC adjustments was approximately $42 million driven primarily by the reduction of expected costs to fulfill contractual commitments on nine contracts related to industrial cooperation agreements for an international customer driven by favorable experience in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in operating margin in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the change in mix and other performance.

   in mix and other performance in   2014   and   2013   was $40 million and $45 million, respectively, of acquisition-related costs. The decrease in volume was principally driven by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The decrease in operating margin in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily driven by the change in mix and other performance. 
    
  The decrease in operating income of   $68 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was due to a decrease in volume of   $56 million   and a net change in EAC adjustments of   $46 million  , partially offset by a change in mix and other performance of   $34 million  . The decrease in volume was driven principally by the programs described above in Total Net Sales. The net change in EAC adjustments was principally from higher EAC adjustments in 2012 on integrated communications systems programs as a result of material and labor efficiencies spread across various production programs. The increase in mix and other performance was primarily due to $34 million of income in 2013 from certain license royalties based on third-party usage compared with $4 million in 2012, partially offset by $45 million of acquisition-related costs in   2013   compared with $33 million in   2012  . Operating margin in 2013 was relatively consistent with 2012. 
    
  Backlog and Bookings   Backlog was   $6,930 million  ,   $7,751 million   and   $7,440 million   at   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The   decrease   in backlog of   $821 million   or   11%   at   December 31, 2014   compared to   December 31, 2013   was primarily due to a backlog adjustment of approximately $450 million for a contract that was terminated for convenience. The   increase   in backlog of   $311 million   at   December 31, 2013   compared to   December 31, 2012   was primarily due to bookings in excess of sales, principally within our Tactical Airborne Systems product line. 
    
  The bookings decrease of   $586 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was driven primarily by lower bookings in our Electronic Warfare and Tactical Airborne Systems product lines, partially offset by higher bookings in our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems product line. In   2014  , SAS booked $267 million to provide radar subsystems for the U.S. Navy, $197 million to provide radar components for an international customer, $105 million for Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) pods and spares for the U.S. Navy and international customers, $92 million on an optical sensor satellite program for a commercial customer, $81 million for software enhancements for the Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars for the U.S. Air Force, and $76 million on the Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) program. SAS also booked $1,320 million on a number of classified contracts 
    
  The bookings   decrease   of   $611 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was driven primarily by the $998 million decrease in the specifically disclosed bookings below. In   2013  , SAS booked $825     million on radar contracts for international customers, $210     million to provide Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems (MTS) for unmanned aerial vehicles to the U.S. Air Force, and $132 million for the Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) program for the U.S. Navy. SAS also booked $862     million on a number of classified contracts. 
    
  In   2012  , SAS booked $617 million on radar contracts for international customers, $205 million to provide MTS for unmanned aerial vehicles to the U.S. Air Force, $187 million for the NMT program for the U.S. Navy, $77 million for the production of radar warning receivers for the U.S. Navy, and $76 million for the production of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) surveillance system for NATO. SAS also booked $1,865 million on a number of classified contracts. 
    
    FAS/CAS Adjustment 
  The FAS/CAS Adjustment represents the difference between our pension and other postretirement benefit (PRB) expense or income under Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The results of each segment only include pension and PRB expense under CAS that we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. 
    
  The components of the FAS/CAS Adjustment were as follows:

   The components of the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment were as follows:    

On December 27, 2011, the CAS Pension Harmonization Rule (CAS Harmonization) was published in the Federal Register. The rule impacted pension costs on contracts beginning in 2013 and has been included for forward pricing purposes since February 2012. The rule intends to improve the alignment of the pension cost recovered through contract pricing under CAS and the pension funding requirements under the PPA. The rule shortened the CAS amortization period for gains and losses from 15 to 10 years and requires the use of a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, consistent with PPA, to measure liabilities in determining the CAS pension expense. While the change in amortization period was applicable in 2013, there is a transition period for the impact of the change in liability measurement method of 0% in 2013, 25% in 2014, 50% in 2015, 75% in 2016 and 100% in 2017. CAS Harmonization increases pension costs under CAS and decreases our FAS/CAS expense in 2014 and beyond primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the rule.  
  In July 2012, the Surface Transportation Extension Act, which is also referred to as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (STE Act), was passed by Congress and signed by the President. The STE Act includes a provision for temporary pension funding relief due to the low interest rate environment. The provision adjusts the 24-month average high quality corporate bond rates used to determine the PPA funded status so that they are within a floor and cap, or  corridor , based on the 25-year average of corporate bond rates. The STE Act gradually phases out this interest rate provision beginning in 2013. In August 2014, the pension provisions of the STE Act were extended as part of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA). As a result, the interest rates used to determine PPA funded status will continue to be adjusted within a  corridor  and do not begin to phase out until 2018. Prior to the extension of such pension funding relief under the HATFA, we expected to make required contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans of approximately   $900 million   in 2014. The HATFA reduced our required 2014 pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions to approximately   $700 million   As a result of lower expected contributions under HATFA in both 2014 and 2015, our 2014 expected tax payments increased by approximately $300 million. The HATFA also impacts our CAS expense in 2014, since CAS Harmonization incorporates the PPA interest rate into CAS calculations. Our 2014 CAS expense decreased by $69 million resulting in a reduction in our 2014 FAS/CAS income by the same amount since the HATFA does not change the calculation of our 2014 FAS expense. However, reductions in our pension contributions under the HATFA would increase our FAS expense in future years by the amount of expected return that would have applied to the contributions. 
    
  The key drivers of the difference between FAS and CAS expense (and consequently, the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment) are the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experience differs from our assumptions under each set of requirements and the calculation of funded status under CAS Harmonization. In accordance with both FAS and CAS, a  calculated market-related value  of our plan assets is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is determined using actual asset gains or losses over a certain prior period (three years for FAS and five years for CAS, subject to certain limitations under CAS on the difference between the market-related value and actual market value of assets). Generally, gains or losses are amortized under FAS over the average future working lifetime of the eligible employee population of approximately 10 years. As described above, beginning in 2013, CAS Harmonization reduced this amortization period from 15 to 10 years, as well as changed the liability measurement method. Another driver of CAS expense (but not FAS expense) is the funded status of our pension plans under CAS. As noted above, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded; consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. 
    
  The change in our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment of   $534 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was driven by a   $345 million   decrease in our FAS expense and by a   $189 million     increase   in our CAS expense. The   decrease   in our FAS expense in   2014   was primarily due to the higher discount rate at December 31, 2013 compared to the discount rate as of December 31, 2012, and the favorable 2013 asset performance. The   increase   in the CAS expense in   2014   was primarily due to the first year of the CAS Harmonization phased transition to the use of a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds,

           Table of Contents  

   consistent with PPA, to measure liabilities in determining the CAS pension expense. This was offset by a decrease in CAS as a result of the passage of the HATFA Act described above. The change in the discount rate used to measure liabilities for purposes of determining CAS pension expenses has been included in our contracts through our overhead forward pricing rates. 
    
  The change in our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment of   $2 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was driven by a   $147 million     increase   in FAS and a   $149 million     increase   in our CAS expense. The   increase   in our FAS expense in   2013   was primarily due to the increase in the amortization of deferred actuarial losses as a result of the decrease in the discount rate. The   increase   in the CAS expense in   2013   was primarily due to the continued recognition of the 2008 negative asset returns.  
    
  For   2015   compared to   2014  ,   we currently expect our FAS expense to increase more than our CAS expense resulting in a lower FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to income. We expect the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to be approximately   $200 million     of income driven by the differences in the assumptions and the recognition period for gains and losses under FAS and CAS and CAS Harmonization and the impact of the change in our long-term ROA assumption, as described above. This expected increase in FAS and CAS expense is subject to our annual update, generally planned in the third quarter, of our actuarial estimate of the unfunded benefit obligation for both FAS and CAS for final census data. After 2015, the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment is more difficult to predict because future FAS and CAS expense is based on a number of key assumptions for future periods. Differences between those assumptions and future actual results could significantly change both FAS and CAS expense in future periods. However, based solely on our current assumptions at December 31, 2014 and taking into account CAS Harmonization, which increases CAS expense in 2014 and beyond, we would expect our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment to increase income in 2016. 
    
  The components of the FAS/CAS PRB Adjustment were as follows: 

Corporate and Eliminations 
  Corporate and Eliminations includes corporate expenses and intersegment sales and profit eliminations. Corporate expenses represent unallocated costs and certain other corporate costs not considered part of management s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance. 
    
  The components of total net sales and operating income related to Corporate and Eliminations were as follows:    

The   decrease   in operating income related to Corporate of   $50 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to   $25 million   of stock compensation expense associated with restricted stock units (RSUs) awarded in   2014  . The RSU awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (MDCC) and are compensatory in nature. The RSUs continue to vest, but do not accelerate, on the scheduled vesting dates into retirement subject to the employee's compliance with certain post-employment covenants. Due to the continued vesting provisions of the RSUs into retirement, the Company recognized all of the stock compensation expense associated with the RSUs in   2014   rather than over the vesting period of the awards.

           Table of Contents  

   Total net sales and operating income related to Corporate in   2013   remained relatively consistent with   2012  . 
    
    Discontinued Operations 
  In pursuing our business strategies we have divested certain non-core businesses, investments and assets when appropriate. All residual activity relating to our previously disposed businesses appears in discontinued operations. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2014, we received notice of the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. Government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standard 413 (CAS 413) for operations we divested over ten years ago. Under CAS 413, a pension plan termination adjustment is required when a contractor divests a business, yet retains ownership of the pension plan assets and liabilities of that business. These adjustments can result in payments to the U.S. Government for pension plans that are in surplus position or payments to contractors for plans that are in a deficit position. As a result, in 2014 we received payment of     $81 million     and recorded a   $  52 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations, attributable to the affected plans that were in a deficit position at the time of divestiture.  
    
  In the divestiture of Flight Options LLC (Flight Options), we agreed to indemnify Flight Options in the event Flight Options was assessed and paid excise taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) appeals proceedings failed to resolve the federal excise tax dispute, and as a result, the IRS assessed Flight Options for excise taxes. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a     $39 million     charge, net of federal tax benefit, in discontinued operations. In the first quarter of 2011, Flight Options paid the assessment. We contested the matter through litigation, and in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement and recorded a   $33 million   gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations. 
    
  Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement regarding certain tax audits associated with our divestiture of Raytheon Aircraft Company. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a     $25 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations.  
    
  We retained certain assets and liabilities of our previously-disposed businesses.   At   December 31, 2014     we had     $1 million   of assets. At   December 31, 2013   we had   $56 million   of assets   primarily related to a receivable for an excise tax settlement associated with Flight Options  . At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , we had   $15 million   and   $16 million   of liabilities   primarily related to certain environmental and product liabilities, non-income tax obligations, various contract obligations and aircraft lease obligations  .   We also retained certain pension assets and obligations, which we include in our pension disclosures.    
    
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  Overview 
  We pursue a capital deployment strategy that balances funding for growing our business, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development; prudently managing our balance sheet, including debt repayments and pension contributions; and returning cash to our shareholders, including dividend payments and share repurchases  , as outlined below. Our need for, cost of and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as other external conditions. We currently expect that cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, cash flow from operations and other available financing resources will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure, investment, debt service and other financing requirements during the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. 
    
  In addition, the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31:

   Operating Activities    

The change of   $194 million   in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to higher pension contributions and higher net tax payments described below, partially offset by discontinued operations cash activity primarily due to a resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. Government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under CAS 413 for operations we divested over ten years ago as discussed above in Segment Results beginning on page   49  . The change of   $421 million   in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to lower net tax payments and lower pension contributions described below. 
    
  Pension Plan Contributions     We may make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined in accordance with the Pension Protection Act (PPA), which amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) rules and are affected by the actual return on plan assets and plan funded status. The funding requirements under the PPA require us to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of the year.   The PPA funded status is based on actual asset performance, averaged over three years and PPA discount rates, which are based on a 24-month average of high quality corporate bond rates, as published by the IRS. In July 2012, the Surface Transportation Extension act, which is also referred to as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (STE Act), was passed by Congress and signed by the President. The STE Act includes a provision for temporary pension funding relief due to the low interest rate environment. The provision adjusts the 24-month average high quality corporate bond rates used to determine the PPA funded status so that they are within a floor and cap, or  corridor , based on the 25-year average of corporate bond rates. The STE Act gradually phases out this interest rate provision beginning in 2013. In August 2014, the pension provisions of the STE Act were extended as part of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA). As a result, the interest rates used to determine PPA funded status will continue to be adjusted within a  corridor  and do not begin to phase out until 2018. Prior to the extension of such pension funding relief under HATFA, we expected to make required contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans of approximately   $900 million   in 2014. The HATFA reduced our required 2014 pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions to approximately   $700 million  . As a result of lower expected contributions under HATFA in both 2014 and 2015, our 2014 expected tax payments increased by approximately   $300 million  .  
    
  We made the following required and discretionary contributions during the years ended December 31:     

The   decrease   in required contributions of   $128 million   in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to HATFA described above. The   increase   in required contributions of   $57 million   in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the gradual phase out of the STE Act described above. We expect to make required contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans of approximately   $360 million   in   2015  . We periodically evaluate whether to make discretionary contributions. Due to the differences in requirements and calculation methodologies, our FAS pension expense or income is not indicative of the funding requirement or amount of government recovery. 
  Other postretirement benefit payments were   $20 million  ,   $22 million   and   $19 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  Tax Payments   We made the following net tax payments during the years ended December 31: 

65 

           Table of Contents  

   Federal and foreign net tax payments for   2015   are expected to approximate   $1,229 million  . The increase in expected federal and foreign net tax payments in 2015 is primarily due to the timing and amount of pension contributions. 
    
  Interest Payments   We made interest payments on our outstanding debt of   $209 million  ,   $210 million   and   $198 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The   increase   in interest payments in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the issuance of $1.1 billion of fixed-rate long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
    
  Investing Activities    

The change of   $849 million   in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to higher cash payments for acquisitions described below and the short-term investments activity described below. The change of   $1,050 million   in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the short-term investments activity described below, and lower cash payments for acquisitions described below. 
    
  Additions to property plant and equipment and capitalized internal use software   Additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized internal use software were as follows:    

We expect our property, plant and equipment and capitalized internal use software expenditures to be between approximately   $410 $470   million and   $50 $70   million, respectively, in   2015  , consistent with the anticipated needs of our business and for specific investments including capital assets and facility improvements. 
    
  Short-term investments activity   We invest in marketable securities in accordance with our short-term investment policy and cash management strategy. These marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value as short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.   Activity related to short-term investments was as follows:    

As of   December 31, 2014  , our short-term investments had an average maturity of approximately five months.    
    
  Acquisitions and Divestitures   In pursuing our business strategies, we acquire and invest in certain businesses that meet strategic and financial criteria, and divest of certain non-core businesses, investments and assets when appropriate. Payments for purchases of acquired companies, net of cash acquired were as follows: 

In November 2014, we acquired Blackbird Technologies, Incorporated, subsequently renamed Raytheon Blackbird Technologies (RBT), for     $427 million     in cash, net of cash acquired, and exclusive of retention payments. RBT is a leading provider of persistent surveillance, secure tactical communications and cybersecurity solutions to the Intelligence Community and special operations market and further expands our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) offerings. In connection with this acquisition, we have preliminarily recorded     $301 million     of goodwill, all of which was allocated to our IIS business segment, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and   $126 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to contractual relationships, completed technology and  

66 

           Table of Contents  

   trade names with a weighted average life of nine years. We expect to complete the purchase price allocation process in the first quarter of 2015 when we receive final valuation results and complete our review. 
    
  In June 2013, we acquired Visual Analytics, Incorporated, subsequently renamed Raytheon Visual Analytics Incorporated.      RVAI further extends our capabilities to meet the data analytics, data visualization and information sharing needs of our customers, and this acquisition is part of our strategy to enhance our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) offerings. In connection with this acquisition, we have recorded     $12 million     of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and     $3 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to technology and customer relationships with a weighted-average life of seven years.    
  In December 2012, we acquired the Government Solutions business of SafeNet, Inc., subsequently renamed Raytheon Secure Information Systems, LLC (RSIS) for approximately     $280 million     in cash, net of cash acquired and exclusive of retention payments. RSIS was integrated into our Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) business, within the Integrated Communications Systems product line as the Secure Information Systems product area. RSIS provides advanced encryption capabilities needed by government and industry customers to protect classified data. In connection with this transaction we have recorded     $195 million     of goodwill related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and     $75 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to technology with a weighted-average life of eight years. 
  Additionally, in 2012 we acquired Teligy, Inc., subsequently renamed Raytheon Teligy, Inc., and an Australian company, Poseidon Scientific Instruments Pty Ltd., for an aggregate of     $22 million     in cash, net of cash acquired. Raytheon Teligy, Inc. further extends our cybersecurity offerings in wireless communications at Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS). The Poseidon Scientific Instruments Pty Ltd. acquisition is part of our strategy to extend and enhance our Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) offerings. In connection with these acquisitions we recorded     $15 million     of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations, and     $5 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and technology with a weighted-average life of six years. 
    
  Financing Activities 

We have used cash provided by operating activities, and proceeds from the issuance of new debt as our primary source for the repayment of debt, payment of dividends, pension contributions, the repurchase of our common stock and acquisitions. The change of   $861 million   in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in   2014   compared to   2013   was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt and the decrease in stock repurchases described below. The change of   $551 million   in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in   2013   compared to   2012   was primarily due to the change in the amount of stock repurchased described below and the net impact of the issuance and repayment of long-term debt in 2012.  
    
  Debt   In the fourth quarter of 2014, we received proceeds of   $592 million   for the issuance of   $600 million   fixed-rate long-term debt.  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, we received proceeds of   $1,092 million   for the issuance of   $1.1 billion   fixed-rate long-term debt and exercised our call rights to repurchase, at prices based on fixed spreads to U.S. Treasuries,   $970 million   of our long-term debt due in 2014 and 2015 at a loss of   $29 million   pretax,   $19 million   after-tax, which is included in other expense (income), net. 
    
  Share Repurchases     In November 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to     $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock. At     December 31, 2014  , we had approximately     $1.5 billion     available under this repurchase program.     Share repurchases will take place from time to time at management s discretion depending on market conditions. 
    
  Share repurchases also include shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option awards issued to employees.

In May 2010, our stockholders approved the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan. Under the plan, we may grant restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock grants, stock options and stock appreciation rights. 
    
  Cash Dividends   Our Board of Directors authorized the following cash dividends:     

In March   2014  , our Board of Directors authorized a   10%   increase to our annual dividend payout rate from   $2.20   to   $2.42   per share. In March   2013  , our Board of Directors authorized a   10%   increase in our annual dividend payout rate from   $2.00   to   $2.20   per share. Dividends are subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors.    
      
  CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Total debt was   $5.3 billion   at   December 31, 2014  , and   $4.7 billion     December 31, 2013  . Our outstanding debt bears contractual interest at fixed interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 7.2% and matures at various dates from 2018 through 2044. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments   Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were   $4.7 billion   and   $4.3 billion   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. We may invest in U.S. Treasuries; AAA/Aaa rated money market funds; certificates of deposit, time deposits and commercial paper of banks with a minimum long-term debt rating of A or A2 and minimum short-term debt rating of A-1 and P-1, and commercial paper of corporations with a minimum long-term debt rating of A- or A3 and minimum short-term debt rating of A-2 and P-2. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were approximately   $715 million   and   $810 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. In the first quarter of 2014, a foreign subsidiary authorized and completed a transaction which resulted in a taxable dividend of approximately   $115 million  . The transaction does not affect our indefinite reinvestment assertion because it generated a net tax benefit of approximately   $80 million  . Earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continuously evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors that affect our global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and capital market conditions. 
    
  Credit Facilities   In December 2011, we entered into a   $1.4 billion   revolving credit facility maturing in 2016.   Under the     $1.4 billion     credit facility, we can borrow, issue letters of credit and backstop commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at various rate options, including LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit ratings. Based on our credit ratings at     December 31, 2014  ,   borrowings would generally bear interest at LIBOR plus     79.5     basis points.   The credit facility is comprised of commitments from approximately     25   separate highly rated lenders, each committing no more than     10%     of the facility. As of     December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  ,   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. However, we had     $2 million     of outstanding letters of credit at   December 31, 2014     and     December 31, 2013  ,   which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under this credit facility by those same amounts.  
    
  Under the     $1.4 billion     credit facility we must comply with certain covenants, including a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than     60%  .   We were in compliance with the credit facility covenants during 2014 and 2013. Our ratio of total debt to total capitalization, as those terms are defined in the credit facility, was     35.9%   at   December 31, 2014  .   We are providing this ratio as this metric is used by our lenders to monitor our leverage and is also a threshold that limits our ability to utilize this facility.

   Credit Ratings   Three major corporate debt rating organizations, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and Standard   Poor s (S P), assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. The following chart reflects the current ratings assigned by each of these agencies as of   December 31, 2014   to our short-term and long-term senior unsecured debt:    

Shelf Registrations   We have an effective shelf registration with the SEC, filed in January 2013, which covers the registration of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock and warrants. 
    
    CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
  The following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding at   December 31, 2014  :    

(1) 
    Debt includes scheduled principal payments only. 
       
  Purchase obligations in the table above represent enforceable and legally binding agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services. We enter into contracts with customers, primarily the U.S. Government, which entitle us to full recourse for costs incurred, including purchase obligations, in the event the contract is terminated by the customer for convenience. These purchase obligations are included above notwithstanding the amount for which we are entitled to full recourse from our customers. The table above does not include required pension and other postretirement benefit contributions. We expect to make required pension and other postretirement benefit contributions of approximately   $360 million   in 2015, exclusive of any U.S. Government recovery. Amounts beyond 2015 for required pension and other postretirement benefit contributions depend upon actuarial assumptions, actual plan asset performance and other factors described under pension costs in Critical Accounting Estimates beginning on page   34  . However, based solely on our current assumptions, we expect our funding requirements to be approximately   $145 million   in 2016, exclusive of any U.S. Government recovery, and decreasing thereafter. 
    
  Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at our option. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest, net of the federal benefit, was   $108 million   and   $121 million  , respectively, and was included in accrued retiree benefits and other long-term liabilities. These amounts were not included in the table above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain. 
     
    OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  At   December 31, 2014  , we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and guarantees to third parties on behalf of our affiliates as described below in Commitments and Contingencies. Such arrangements are not material to our overall liquidity or capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support as described below.

             Table of Contents  

   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Environmental Matters     We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of the liability of total environmental remediation costs includes the use of a discount rate and takes into account that a portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. Government within contracts in process, net. Our estimates regarding remediation costs to be incurred were as follows at December 31  :     

We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our consolidated financial statements.     
    
  Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of environmental matters. However, we do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred are:    

Financing Arrangements and Other     We issue guarantees, and banks and surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. These instruments expire on various dates through 2023. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. The stated values outstanding consisted of the following at   December 31:     

Included in guarantees and letters of credit described above were   $196 million   and   $244 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  , and   $233 million   and   $268 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2013  , related to our Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. (TRS) joint venture.   We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans and meet their project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation to us. We periodically evaluate the risk of TRS and other affiliates failing to satisfy their loans and meet their project performance and other contractual obligations described above.   At   December 31, 2014  ,   we believe the risk that TRS and other affiliates will not be able to perform or meet their obligations is minimal for the foreseeable future based on their current financial condition. All obligations were current at     December 31, 2014  . At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , we had an estimated  

70 

             Table of Contents  

   liability of   $9 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, related to these guarantees and letters of credit.   The increase in letters of credit of     $514 million     in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by advance payment bonds of approximately     $500 million     related to certain international programs.    
    
  The TRS joint venture agreement was amended on June 10, 2014 to allow for termination of the joint venture by either party every three years based on the scheduled date for the designation of a successor Chief Executive Officer for the joint venture which would next occur in 2016. Termination terms and related payments are subject to negotiation between Thales S.A. (Thales) and Raytheon, but generally would include a net payment due for undistributed earnings of the joint venture companies since inception and a net payment based on the relative fair value of those companies excluding Air Command Systems International S.A.S. (ACSI). As a result, any final future termination amounts cannot be determined precisely at this time and could be different from those amounts recorded to date. However, if the joint venture were terminated as of     December 31, 2014  , we believe the termination payment we would be required to make based on a standard valuation approach would not be material. If a termination liability exceeds     $50 million  , the agreement allows the paying side to elect to make payments, inclusive of interest, in equal installments over five years to settle the liability.    
    
  In 1997, we provided a first loss guarantee of     $133 million     on     $1.3 billion     of U.S. Export-Import Bank loans (maturing in the second quarter of 2015) to the Brazilian Government related to IDS' System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program. As of   December 31, 2014  ,   the guarantee amount was     $60 million  .   Loan repayments by the Brazilian Government were current at   December 31, 2014  . 
  We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries.   At   December 31, 2014  ,   the aggregate amount of our offset agreements had an outstanding notional value of approximately     $5 billion  . To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations that satisfy our offset agreements, those amounts are included in the Contractual Obligations table on page   69  .   These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities, or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have historically not been required to pay any such penalties. 
    
  As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to many levels of audit and investigation by the U.S. Government relating to our contract performance and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracting. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. Government with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the Department of Justice has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S. and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. Government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations) may also be investigated or audited.     Other than as specifically disclosed herein, we do not expect these audits, investigations or

             Table of Contents  

   disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate.       
    
  On July 22, 2010, Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL) was notified by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) that it had been terminated for cause on a program. The termination notice included allegations that RSL had failed to perform on certain key milestones and other matters in addition to claiming entitlement to recovery of certain losses incurred and previous payments made to RSL. We believe that RSL performed well and delivered substantial capabilities to the UKBA under the program, which has been operating successfully and providing actionable information since live operations began in May 2009. As a result of the termination notice, we adjusted our estimated amounts of revenue and cost under the program in the second quarter of 2010.     On July 29, 2010, RSL filed a dispute notice on the grounds that the termination by the UKBA was not valid. On August 18, 2010, the UKBA initiated arbitration proceedings on this issue. On March 22, 2011, the UKBA gave notice that it had presented a demand to draw on the approximately     $80 million     of letters of credit provided by RSL upon the signing of the contract with the UKBA in 2007. On March 23, 2011, the UKBA submitted a detailed claim in the arbitration of approximately      350 million   (approximately   $545 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  )   for damages and clawback of previous payments, plus interest and arbitration costs, excluding any credit for capability delivered or draw on the letters of credit. The UKBA also asserted that additional amounts may be detailed in the claim in the future if estimates of its damages change, and for continuing post-termination losses and any re-procurement costs, which have not been quantified. At RSL's request, on March 29, 2011, the Arbitration Tribunal issued an interim order restraining the UKBA from drawing down on the letters of credit pending a hearing on the issue. Following the hearing, the Tribunal lifted the restraint on the basis that, at this early stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal had not heard the evidence needed to decide the merits of whether the contractual conditions for a drawdown had been established. The Tribunal also concluded that any decision on the UKBA's right to call on the letters of credit is inextricably intertwined with the ultimate decision on the merits in the arbitration. The Tribunal also preserved RSL's right to claim damages should RSL later establish that the drawdown was not valid. As a result, on April 6, 2011, the UKBA drew the     $80 million   on the letters of credit. 
    
  As a result of the Tribunal's decision that the letters of credit are inextricably intertwined with the ultimate decision on the merits in the arbitration, we were no longer able to evaluate, independently from the overall claim, the probability of recovery of any amounts drawn on the letters of credit. We therefore recorded     $80 million   of costs related to the UKBA drawdown (UKBA LOC Adjustment), which was included in the operating expenses of our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) segment in the first quarter of 2011. 
    
  In June 2011, RSL submitted in the arbitration its defenses to the UKBA claim as well as substantial counterclaims in the amount of approximately      500 million   (approximately   $778 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  )   against the UKBA for the collection of receivables, damages and interest. On October 3, 2011, the UKBA filed its reply to RSL's counterclaims, and increased its claim amount by approximately      32 million  ,   to include additional civil service and post termination costs, and approximately      33 million     for interest, raising the gross amount of the UKBA claim for damages and clawback of previous payments to approximately      415 million   (approximately   $646 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  ).   On January 6, 2012, RSL filed its response to the UKBA's reply. RSL is pursuing vigorously the collection of all receivables for the program and damages in connection with the wrongful termination and mounted a strong defense to the UKBA's alleged claims for losses and previous payments. RSL has also settled substantially all subcontractor claims, novated all key subcontracts to the UKBA and agreed with the UKBA that RSL's exit obligations to operate the previously delivered capability ended in April 2011. Effective April 15, 2011, the UKBA took over responsibility for operating the previously delivered capability.     In March 2013, the UKBA updated the total net amount of its claims to approximately      302 million     (approximately     $470 million     based on foreign exchange rates as of     December 31, 2014  )   for damages, clawback of previous payments and interest, and inclusive of a credit for capability delivered by RSL. Arbitration hearings commenced in late   2013     and were completed in 2013. We continue to believe that the receivables and other assets remaining under the program for technology and services delivered of approximately $40 million at     December 31, 2014     are probable of recovery. 
    
  On August 15, 2014, RSL received a decision from the Tribunal. The Tribunal found that the UKBA had unlawfully terminated RSL for default and had therefore repudiated the eBorders contract with RSL. Accordingly, the Tribunal denied the UKBA s claims for damages and clawback of previous payments. In addition, the Tribunal found that the UKBA had wrongfully retained the     $80 million     it had drawn on RSL letters of credit in April 2011. The Tribunal awarded RSL approximately      185 million   (approximately   $288 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  )   as  

72 

             Table of Contents  

   payment for capabilities delivered, damages and other monetary relief. The Tribunal reserved ruling on costs and on the quantification of interest payable to RSL for a later date.    
    
  On September 15, 2014, the UKBA filed a challenge to the award in the London High Court. RSL is vigorously opposing such challenge. The payment of amounts awarded to RSL is now pending resolution of the challenge. Due to the inherent uncertainties of arbitration and litigation, no amounts regarding this matter were recorded in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
  On June 29, 2012 and July 13, 2012, we received a contracting officer s final decision (COFD) for 2004 and 2005 incurred costs at SAS. The COFDs demand a total payment of     $241 million     for costs, interest and penalties associated with several issues, the largest of which relates to specific research and development and capital projects undertaken by SAS between 2000 and 2005. To date, no COFDs have been provided for 2000 to 2003 periods at SAS on these issues. The Government alleges that the costs incurred on the projects should have been charged directly to U.S. Government contracts rather than through indirect rates and that these costs should not be recoverable. We strongly disagree with the Government's position. We have requested a deferment of the payment and in February and May 2013, we filed complaints in the U.S. COFC challenging the 2004 and 2005 COFDs, respectively. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot estimate a range of potential loss. We believe that we appropriately charged the disputed costs based on government accounting standards and applicable precedent and properly disclosed our approach to the Government. We also believe that in many cases, the statute of limitations has run on the issues. Based upon the foregoing, we do not expect the results of the COFDs to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
    
  In addition, various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against, or initiated by, us. We do not expect any of these proceedings to result in any additional liability or gains that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   In connection with certain of our legal matters, we may be entitled to insurance recovery for qualified legal costs. We do not expect any insurance recovery to have a material impact on the financial exposure that could result from these matters. 
    
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. For Raytheon, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential changes from this ASU to our future financial reporting and disclosures.     However, under the new standard we expect to continue using the cost-to-cost percentage of completion method to recognize revenue for most of our long-term contracts. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under the new guidance, management will be required to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. This ASU is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements or disclosures.    
    
  Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after     December 31, 2014     are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Our primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. 
    
  We generally supplement our working capital requirements with a combination of variable-rate short-term and fixed-rate long-term financing. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the foreign currency exchange rates on specific commitments and payments to vendors and customer receipts. We may enter into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks to manage interest rates associated with our financing arrangements. The market-risk sensitive instruments we use for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability or transaction for which a firm commitment is in place. 
    
  The following tables provide information as of   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013   about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  . 

As of December 31, 2014    
  Principal Payments and Interest Rate Detail by Contractual Maturity Dates 
  (In millions, except percentages) 

As of December 31, 2013    
  Principal Payments and Interest Rate Detail by Contractual Maturity Dates 
  (In millions, except percentages) 

In addition, the aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was   $926 million   and   $1,396 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively.   The net exposure of these contracts was approximately     $57 million   and   $78 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. 
    
  For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualifying for hedge accounting, we record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged revenue or cost of sales transaction affects earnings. Unrealized gains of   $7 million   and   $23 million   were included in non-current assets and unrealized losses of   $24 million   and   $26 million   were included in current liabilities at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively.  
    
  Realized gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. We believe our exposure due to changes in foreign currency rates is not material due to our hedging policy. 
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , we had short-term investments with a fair value of   $1,497 million  , which are classified as available-for-sale and consist of highly rated bank certificates of deposit with a minimum long-term debt rating of A or A2 and a minimum short-term debt rating of A-1 and P-1. Our exposure due to changes in interest rates is not material due to the nature and amount of our short-term investments (i.e., high-quality certificates of deposit which had an average maturity of approximately 5 months).

   ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
    
    COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  The financial statements and related information contained in this Annual Report have been prepared by and are the responsibility of our management. Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect judgments and estimates as to the expected effects of transactions and events currently being reported. Our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report. To meet this responsibility, we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers  reviews. 
    
  Our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is composed solely of directors who are independent under applicable SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules. Our Audit Committee meets periodically and, when appropriate, separately with representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, our officers and the internal auditors to monitor the activities of each. 
    
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was appointed by our Audit Committee to audit our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting and their report follows. Our stockholders ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the   2014   Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
    
    MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. The Company s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2014  , based on criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework, issued by the COSO in 2013. The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2014  , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included below.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
    
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Raytheon Company: 
    
  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   December 31, 2014   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   December 31, 2014  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Consolidation and Classification   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Raytheon Company, and all wholly-owned, majority-owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. As used in these notes, the terms  we ,  us ,  our ,  Raytheon  and the  Company  mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning. 
    
  Use of Estimates   Our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition     We use the percentage-of-completion accounting method to account for our long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, such as certain cost-plus service contracts. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the long-term contract.     Our analysis of these contracts also contemplates whether contracts should be combined or segmented in accordance with the applicable criteria under GAAP. We combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under GAAP are met. The combination of two or more contracts requires judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single project, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if the applicable criteria under GAAP are met. Judgment also is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segmented based on how the arrangement was negotiated and the performance criteria. The decision to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period.     
    
  The selection of the method by which to measure progress towards completion of a contract also requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our long-term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress towards completion of the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Contract costs include labor, materials and subcontractors costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion (the process for which we describe below in more detail) is complex and subject to many variables. Incentive and award fees generally are awarded at the discretion of the customer or upon achievement of certain program milestones or cost targets. Incentive and award fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance, which may include the performance of subcontractors or partners depending on the individual contract requirements. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event generally are not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated.    
    
  We have a Company-wide standard and disciplined quarterly Estimate at Completion (EAC)   process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities include management's judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the  

82 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (e.g., to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials and related support cost allocations), performance by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, and overhead cost rates, among other variables. These estimates also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset obligations, required under certain contracts. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustments to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized as necessary in the period they become known. These adjustments may result from positive program performance, and may result in an increase in operating income during the performance of individual contracts, if we determine we will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of those contracts or realizing related opportunities. Likewise, these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating income if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks or realizing related     opportunities. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recognized quarterly on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract's percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts.     When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined.     
    
  Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: 

To a much lesser extent, we enter into other types of contracts such as service, commercial, or software and licensing arrangements. Revenue under fixed-price service contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment, and under commercial contracts, generally is recognized upon delivery or as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Costs on fixed-price service contracts are expensed as incurred, unless they otherwise qualify for deferral.     We recognize revenue on contracts to sell software when evidence of an arrangement exists, the software has been delivered and accepted by the customer, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. For software arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software licenses and undelivered items (e.g., maintenance and/or services; subscriptions/term licenses), we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize revenue on the perpetual license using the residual method. We base VSOE of each element on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the applicable performance period. Revenue from non-software license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Additionally, royalty revenue is recognized when earned.     
  We apply the separation guidance under GAAP for contracts with multiple deliverables. We analyze revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine if the deliverables should be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices, which we determine based on prices of the deliverables as sold on a stand-alone basis, or if not sold on a stand-alone basis, the prices we would charge if sold on a stand-alone basis. We recognize revenue for each deliverable based on the revenue recognition policies described above.    
    
  Research and Development Expenses   Research and development expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred, and were   $500 million  ,   $465 million   and   $451 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts are accounted for as contract costs as the work is performed and included in contracts in process, net in our consolidated balance sheets.

Federal, Foreign and State Income Taxes   The Company and its domestic subsidiaries provide for federal income taxes on pretax accounting income at rates in effect under existing tax law. Foreign subsidiaries record provisions for income taxes at applicable foreign tax rates in a similar manner. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. The Company does not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations or expected to be remitted substantially free of additional tax. Payments made for state income taxes are included in administrative and selling expenses as these costs can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. Government in the period in which the tax is payable. Accordingly, the state income tax provision (benefit) is allocated to contracts in future periods as described below in Deferred Contract Costs. 
    
  Other Expense (Income), Net   Other expense (income), net consists primarily of gains and losses from our investments held in trusts used to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, gains and losses on the early repurchase of long-term debt and certain financing fees. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of   90   days or less at the date of purchase. The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities.  
    
  Short-term Investments     We invest in marketable securities in accordance with our short-term investment policy and cash management strategy. These marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value as short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.   These investments are deemed Level 2 assets under the fair value hierarchy at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , as their fair value is determined under a market approach using valuation models that utilize observable inputs, including maturity date, issue date, settlements date, and current rates. At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , we had short-term investments of   $1,497 million   and   $1,001 million  , respectively, consisting of highly rated bank certificates of deposit with a minimum long-term debt rating of A or A2 and a minimum short-term debt rating of A-1 and P-1.   As of   December 31, 2014  , our short-term investments had an average maturity of approximately five months.   The amortized cost of these securities closely approximated their fair value at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  . There were no securities deemed to have other than temporary declines in value for   2014  . In   2014  , we recorded unrealized losses on short-term investments of less than   $1 million  , net of tax, in AOCL. In   2013  , we recorded unrealized gains on short-term investments of less than   $1 million  , net of tax, in AOCL. In   2014  , we recorded sales of short-term investments of   $882 million  , which resulted in gains of less than   $1 million   recorded in other (income) expense, net. In   2013  , we recorded sales of short-term investments of   $325 million  , which resulted in gains of approximately   $1 million   recorded in other (income) expense, net. For purposes of computing realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, we determine cost on a specific identification basis.  
    
  Contracts in Process, Net   Contracts in process, net are stated at cost plus estimated profit, but not in excess of estimated realizable value. Included in contracts in process are accounts receivable, which include amounts billed and due from customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and collateral to the extent applicable. 
    
  Deferred Contract Costs   Included in contracts in process, net are certain costs related to the performance of our U.S. Government contracts which are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income taxes, workers  compensation and certain other accruals. At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , net deferred contract costs were approximately   $223 million   and   $279 million  , respectively. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. 
    
  Pension and other postretirement benefits costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based on the U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS). The CAS requirements for pension and other postretirement benefits costs differ from the financial accounting standards (FAS) requirements under GAAP. Given the inability to match with  

84 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS income or expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity, and therefore did not defer any FAS expense for pension and other postretirement benefits plans in   2012     2014  . This resulted in   $286 million   of income,   $249 million   of   expense  , and   $255 million   of   expense   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively, reflected in our consolidated results of operations for the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension and other postretirement benefits plans in those years. 
    
  Inventories   Inventories are stated at cost (first-in, first-out or average cost), but not in excess of net realizable value. An impairment for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, future sales expectations and salvage value. 
    
  Inventories consisted of the following at December 31:    

We capitalize costs incurred in advance of contract award or funding in inventories if we determine that contract award or funding is probable. To the extent these are precontract costs, start-up costs have been excluded. We included capitalized precontract costs and other deferred costs of approximately   $126 million   and   $100 million   in inventories as work in process at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  . 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment, Net   Property, plant and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed. We include gains and losses on the sales of plant and equipment that are allocable to our contracts in overhead as we generally can recover these costs through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. Government. For all other sales or asset retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. 
    
  Provisions for depreciation generally are computed using a combination of accelerated and straight-line methods and are based on estimated useful lives as follows:    

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. 
    
  Impairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets   We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter utilizing a two-step methodology that requires us to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of the related goodwill impairment loss, if any. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units under the impairment test assessment criteria outlined in GAAP. In performing our annual impairment test in the fourth quarters of   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   we did not identify any goodwill impairment. 
    
  We determine whether long-lived assets are to be held for use or disposal. Upon indication of possible impairment of long-lived assets held for use, we evaluate the recoverability of such assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. 

85 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

Computer Software, Net   Internal use computer software, net, included in other assets, net, which consists primarily of our enterprise-wide software solutions, is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, generally   10   years. 
    
  Advance Payments and Billings in Excess of Costs Incurred   We receive advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from customers that may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. We classify advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred as current liabilities. Costs incurred in excess of billings are classified as contracts in process, net. 
    
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign exchange translation adjustments, gains and losses on derivative instruments qualified as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains (losses) on investments, and gains and losses associated with pension and other postretirement benefits. The computation of other comprehensive income (loss) and its components are presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  
    
  Other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following activity during the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012  :  

Material amounts reclassified out of AOCL were related to amortization of net actuarial loss associated with our pension and other employee benefit plans and were   $892 million  ,   $1,154 million   and   $942 million   before tax in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. This component of AOCL is included in the calculation of net periodic pension expense (income) (see "Note 13: Pension and Other Employee Benefits" for additional details). 
    
  The defined benefit pension and other employee benefit plans are shown net of tax benefits of   $4,005 million   and   $2,780 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. The cash flow hedges and interest rate locks are shown net of tax benefits of   $8 million   and   $4 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. The unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other are shown net of tax benefits of   $2 million   and   $4 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. We expect approximately   $6 million   of after-tax net unrealized losses on our cash flow hedges at   December 31, 2014   to be reclassified into earnings at then-current values over the next twelve months as the underlying hedged transactions occur. 
    
  Translation of Foreign Currencies   Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates and the effects of these translation adjustments are reported as a component of AOCL in equity. Deferred taxes are not recognized for translation-related temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries as their undistributed earnings are  

86 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Income and expenses in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012   were not material. 
    
  Treasury Stock   Repurchased shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. We account for treasury stock under the cost method. Upon retirement the excess over par value is charged against additional paid-in capital. 
    
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Costs   We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. We calculate our pension costs as required under GAAP, and the calculations and assumptions utilized require judgment. GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes. For purposes of determining pension expense under GAAP, a calculated  market-related value  of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is determined using actual asset gains or losses over a three year period. Under GAAP,   a  corridor  approach may be elected and applied in the recognition of asset and liability gains or losses which limits expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10 percent of the projected benefit obligation or the calculated "market-related value" of assets. We do not use a  corridor  approach in the calculation of FAS expense.   
    
  We recognize the funded status of a postretirement benefit plan (defined benefit pension and other benefits) as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets. Funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the market value of the plan s assets. Previously unrecognized deferred amounts such as demographic or asset gains or losses and the impact of historical plan changes are included in AOCL. Changes in these amounts in future years will be reflected through AOCL and amortized in future pension expense over the estimated average remaining employee service period. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments   We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the foreign currency exchange rates on specific commitments, payments, and receipts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are transaction driven and relate directly to a particular asset, liability or transaction for which commitments are in place. For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, we record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in AOCL, net of tax, and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged revenue or cost of sales transaction affects earnings. 
    
  We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. We measure and record the impact of counterparty credit risk into our valuation and the impact was not material for the years ended   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . We designate most foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies, and interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate financing obligations. We classify the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  Realized gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged. Gains and losses on derivatives not designated for hedge accounting or representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized currently in net sales or cost of sales. 
    
  We also periodically enter into pay-variable, receive-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate financing obligations. We account for our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of our fixed-rate financing obligations, and accordingly record gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these swaps in interest expense, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the fair value adjustment of the hedged portion of our fixed-rate financing obligations. We also record in interest expense the net amount paid or received under the swap for the period and the amortization of gain or loss from the early termination of interest rate swaps. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding for the years ended   December 31, 2014     and   2013  . For a discussion of the impacts of our hedging activities on our results, see "Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments". 
    
  Fair Values   The accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an  

87 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required: 
    
           Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
       
           Level 2: 
    Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or that we corroborate with observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.   
       
           Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
       
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of marketable securities held in trust, short-term investments and foreign currency forward contracts as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . Fair value information for those assets and liabilities, including their classification in the fair value hierarchy, is included in "Note 13: Pension and Other Employee Benefits" (for marketable securities held in trust), "Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" (for short-term investments), and "Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments" (for foreign currency forward contracts). We did not have any significant nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that would be recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . We did not have any material amounts of Level 3 assets or liabilities at   December 31, 2014   and   2013  . 
    
  Earnings per Share (EPS)   We compute basic EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders by dividing income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, and net income attributable to Raytheon Company, by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, including participating securities outstanding, as described below, during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution beyond shares for basic EPS that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, converted into common stock, or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would have shared in our earnings. We compute basic and diluted EPS using actual income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, net income attributable to Raytheon Company, and our actual weighted-average shares and participating securities outstanding rather than the numbers presented within our consolidated financial statements, which are rounded to the nearest million. As a result, it may not be possible to recalculate EPS as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, it may not be possible to recalculate EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders by adjusting EPS from continuing operations by EPS from discontinued operations. 
    
  We include all unvested stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, in the number of shares outstanding in our basic and diluted EPS calculations. As a result, we have included all of our outstanding unvested restricted stock and Long-term Performance Plan (LTPP) awards that meet the retirement eligible criteria in our calculation of basic and diluted EPS. We disclose EPS for common stock and unvested share-based payment awards, and separately disclose distributed and undistributed earnings. Distributed earnings represent common stock dividends and dividends earned on unvested share-based payment awards of retirement eligible employees. Undistributed earnings represent earnings that were available for distribution but were not distributed. Common stock and unvested share-based payment awards earn dividends equally. 
    
  Employee Stock Plans   Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. The expense is recognized over the employees  requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The expense is amortized over the service period using the graded vesting method for our restricted stock and restricted stock units and the straight-line amortization method for our LTPP. The related gross excess tax benefit received upon exercise of stock options or vesting of a stock-based award, if any, is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity rather than an operating activity. 
    
  Risks and Uncertainties   We provide a wide range of technologically advanced products, services and solutions for principally governmental customers in the U.S. and abroad, and are subject to certain business risks specific to that

industry. Total sales to the U.S. Government, excluding foreign military sales, were   70%  ,   72%  , and   73%   of total net sales in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Total sales to customers outside the U.S., including foreign military sales through the U.S. Government, were   29%  ,   27%   and   26%   of total net sales in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Sales to the U.S. Government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing concepts of national defense, political developments abroad and other factors. Sales to international customers may be affected by changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by changes in threat environments, geo-political uncertainties, potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions, various regional and local economic and political factors, risks and uncertainties and U.S. foreign policy.  
    
    Note 2: Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. For Raytheon, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential changes from this ASU to our future financial reporting and disclosures.     However, under the new standard we expect to continue using the cost-to-cost percentage of completion method to recognize revenue for most of our long-term contracts. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under the new guidance, management will be required to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. This ASU is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements or disclosures.    
    
  Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after     December 31, 2014     are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.    
    
    Note 3: Acquisitions 
  In pursuing our business strategies, we acquire and make investments in certain businesses that meet strategic and financial criteria.  
    
  In November 2014, we acquired Blackbird Technologies, Incorporated, subsequently renamed Raytheon Blackbird Technologies (RBT), for     $427 million     in cash, net of cash acquired, and exclusive of retention payments. RBT is a leading provider of persistent surveillance, secure tactical communications and cybersecurity solutions to the Intelligence Community and special operations market and further expands our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) offerings. In connection with this acquisition, we have preliminarily recorded     $301 million     of goodwill, all of which was allocated to our IIS business segment, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and   $126 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to contractual relationships, completed technology and trade names with a weighted average life of nine years. We expect to complete the purchase price allocation process in the first quarter of 2015 when we receive final valuation results and complete our review.

In June 2013, we acquired Visual Analytics, Incorporated, subsequently renamed Raytheon Visual Analytics Incorporated.      RVAI further extends our capabilities to meet the data analytics, data visualization and information sharing needs of our customers, and this acquisition is part of our strategy to enhance our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) offerings. In connection with this acquisition, we have recorded     $12 million     of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and     $3 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to technology and customer relationships with a weighted-average life of seven years.    
    
  In December 2012, we acquired the Government Solutions business of SafeNet, Inc., subsequently renamed Raytheon Secure Information Systems, LLC (RSIS) for approximately     $280 million     in cash, net of cash acquired and exclusive of retention payments. RSIS was integrated into our Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) business, within the Integrated Communications Systems product line as the Secure Information Systems product area. RSIS provides advanced encryption capabilities needed by government and industry customers to protect classified data. In connection with this transaction we have recorded     $195 million     of goodwill related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and     $75 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to technology with a weighted-average life of eight years.     
  Additionally, in 2012 we acquired Teligy, Inc., subsequently renamed Raytheon Teligy, Inc., and an Australian company, Poseidon Scientific Instruments Pty Ltd., for an aggregate of     $22 million     in cash, net of cash acquired. Raytheon Teligy, Inc. further extends our cybersecurity offerings in wireless communications at Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS). The Poseidon Scientific Instruments Pty Ltd. acquisition is part of our strategy to extend and enhance our Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) offerings. In connection with these acquisitions we recorded     $15 million     of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations, and     $5 million     of intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and technology with a weighted-average life of six years. 
    
  Pro forma financial information and revenue from the date of acquisition has not been provided for these acquisitions as they are not material either individually or in the aggregate. 
    
  We funded each of the above acquisitions using cash on hand. The operating results of these businesses have been included in our consolidated results as of the respective closing dates of the acquisitions. The purchase price of these businesses has been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. 
    
  The total amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes related to these acquisitions was   $489 million   at   December 31, 2014  .

A rollforward of goodwill by segment is as follows:    

Note 4: Discontinued Operations 
  In pursuing our business strategies we have divested certain non-core businesses, investments and assets when appropriate. All residual activity relating to our previously disposed businesses appears in discontinued operations.    
    
  In the second quarter of 2014, we received notice of the resolution of a dispute and related litigation with the U.S. Government regarding pension segment closing adjustments under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standard 413 (CAS 413) for operations we divested over ten years ago. Under CAS 413, a pension plan termination adjustment is required when a contractor divests a business, yet retains ownership of the pension plan assets and liabilities of that business. These adjustments can result in payments to the U.S. Government for pension plans that are in surplus position or payments to contractors for plans that are in a deficit position. As a result, in 2014 we received payment of     $81 million     and recorded a     $52 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations, attributable to the affected plans that were in a deficit position at the time of divestiture.  
    
  In the divestiture of Flight Options LLC (Flight Options), we agreed to indemnify Flight Options in the event Flight Options was assessed and paid excise taxes. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) appeals proceedings failed to resolve the federal excise tax dispute, and as a result, the IRS assessed Flight Options for excise taxes. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a     $39 million     charge, net of federal tax benefit, in discontinued operations. In the first quarter of 2011, Flight Options paid the assessment. We contested the matter through litigation, and in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement and recorded a   $33 million   gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations. 
    
  Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2013, we reached a settlement regarding certain tax audits associated with our divestiture of Raytheon Aircraft Company. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a     $25 million     gain, net of federal tax expense, in discontinued operations.     
    
  We retained certain assets and liabilities of our previously-disposed businesses.   At   December 31, 2014     we had     $1 million   of assets. At   December 31, 2013   we had   $56 million   of assets   primarily related to a receivable for an excise tax settlement associated with Flight Options  . At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , we had   $15 million   and   $16 million   of liabilities   primarily related to certain environmental and product liabilities, non-income tax obligations, various contract obligations and aircraft lease obligations  .   We also retained certain pension assets and obligations, which we include in our pension disclosures.

Note 5: Contracts in Process, Net 
  Contracts in process, net consisted of the following at December 31:    

The U.S. Government has title to the assets related to unbilled amounts on contracts that provide progress payments. Unbilled amounts are recorded under the percentage-of-completion method and are recoverable from the customer upon shipment of the product, presentation of billings or completion of the contract. Included in unbilled at   December 31, 2014   was   $190 million   which is expected to be collected outside of one year. 
    
  Billed and unbilled contracts in process include retentions arising from contractual provisions. At   December 31, 2014  , retentions were   $50 million  . We anticipate collecting   $5 million   of these retentions in   2015   and the balance thereafter. 
    
    Note 6: Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 
  Property, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following at December 31: 

Depreciation and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment, net was   $301 million  ,   $303 million   and   $318 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.

Note 7: Other Assets, Net 
  Other assets, net consisted of the following at December 31: 

Computer software amortization expense was   $79 million  ,   $82 million   and   $88 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.  
    
  Other intangible assets, net consisted primarily of drawings and intellectual property, and increased   $126 million  ,   $3 million   and   $80 million   as a result of acquired businesses in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from   2   to   25   years using either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefits we expect to realize from such assets. Amortization expense for other intangible assets was   $58 million  ,   $60 million   and   $49 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  Computer software and other intangible asset amortization expense is expected to be approximately   $127 million   in 2015,   $108 million   in 2016,   $85 million   in 2017,   $72 million   in 2018 and   $59 million   in 2019. 
    
  Investments, which are included in other noncurrent assets, net above consisted of the following at December 31:    

In 2001, we formed the TRS joint venture. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars, and communication networks. We record our share of the TRS income or loss and other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of cost of sales and AOCL, respectively. We record losses beyond the carrying amount of the investment only when we guarantee obligations of the investee or commit to provide the investee further financial support. 
    
  TRS has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which, Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. LLC (TRS LLC), we control and consolidate and is a component of our IDS segment, and the other one, Thales-Raytheon Systems Company S.A.S. (TRS SAS), which we account for using the equity method through our investment in TRS. Of the   $98 million   investment in TRS,   $60 million   represents undistributed earnings at   December 31, 2014  . Our consolidated statements of operations includes net income, which represents net income attributable to Raytheon Company and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Our primary noncontrolling interest relates to TRS LLC. TRS LLC has a joint venture with TRS SAS called Air Command Systems International S.A.S. (ACSI), for which TRS LLC performs work. At   December 31, 2014  , TRS LLC had   $18 million   of receivables due from ACSI. 
    
  In addition, we have entered into certain joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of a customer, generally the U.S. Government, whereby we receive a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint venture s capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, we record the work we perform for the joint venture as an operating activity.

Periodically we enter into other equity method investments that are not related to our core operations. We record the income or loss from these investments as a component of other (income) expense, net. We record losses beyond the carrying amount of the investment only when we guarantee obligations of the investee or commit to provide the investee further financial support. 
    
    Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Our primary market exposures are to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, and we use certain derivative financial instruments to help manage these exposures. We execute these instruments with financial institutions that we judge to be credit-worthy, and the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  The fair value amounts of asset derivatives included in other assets, net and liability derivatives included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets related to foreign currency forward contracts were as follows at December 31:    

The fair values of these derivatives are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy for 2014 and 2013 because they are determined based on a market approach utilizing externally quoted forward rates for similar contracts. 
    
  We recognized the following pretax gains (losses) related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges:

We recognized the following pretax gains (losses) related to foreign currency forward contracts not designated as cash flow hedges: 

We use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the functional currency value of specific commitments, payments and receipts. The aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was   $926 million   and   $1,396 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively.   The net exposure of these contracts was approximately     $57 million   and   $78 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. The foreign currency forward contracts at   December 31, 2014   have maturities at various dates through 2028 as follows:   $551 million   in 2015;   $224 million   in 2016;   $116 million   in 2017;   $14 million   in 2018; and   $21 million   thereafter. 
    
  Our foreign currency forward contracts contain off-set or netting provisions to mitigate credit risk in the event of counterparty default, including payment default and cross default. At both   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , the fair value of our counterparty default exposure was less than   $1 million   and spread across numerous highly-rated counterparties.    
    
  There were no interest rate swaps outstanding at   December 31, 2014   or   December 31, 2013  .

In December 2014, we issued   $600 million   of fixed-rate long-term debt with half maturing in 10 years and the other half maturing in 30 years. In conjunction with the debt issuance, we entered into interest rate lock agreements with a total notional value of   $100 million   to manage interest rate risk, which resulted in an increase to AOCL of less than   $1 million   to be amortized over the term of the debt issued. 
    
  In December 2012, we issued   $1.1 billion   of fixed-rate long-term debt with a maturity of   10   years. In conjunction with the debt issuance, we entered into interest rate lock agreements with a total notional value of   $700 million   to manage interest rate risk, which resulted in a decrease to AOCL of   $3 million   to be amortized over the term of the debt issued. As of December 31, 2012, the above referenced interest rate locks were closed out. 
    
    Note 9: Notes Payable and Long-term Debt 
  Notes payable and long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:    

The notes are redeemable by us at any time at redemption prices based on U.S. Treasury rates. The carrying value of long-term debt was recorded at amortized cost. The fair value of long-term debt was determined on quoted prices in inactive markets, which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The estimated fair value of long-term debt was the following at December 31: 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we received proceeds of   $592 million   for the issuance of   $600 million   fixed-rate long-term debt. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, we received proceeds of   $1,092 million   for the issuance of   $1.1 billion   fixed-rate long-term debt and exercised our call rights to repurchase, at prices based on fixed spreads to the U.S. Treasuries,   $970 million   of our long-term debt due 2014 and 2015 at a loss of   $29 million   pretax,   $19 million   after-tax, which is included in other (income) expense, net.

The adjustments to the principal amounts of long-term debt were as follows at December 31:    

The aggregate amounts of principal payments due on long-term debt for the next five years are: 

In December 2011, we entered into a   $1.4 billion   revolving credit facility maturing in 2016.   Under the     $1.4 billion     credit facility, we can borrow, issue letters of credit and backstop commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at various rate options, including LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit ratings. Based on our credit ratings at     December 31, 2014  ,   borrowings would generally bear interest at LIBOR plus     79.5     basis points.   The credit facility is comprised of commitments from approximately     25   separate highly rated lenders, each committing no more than     10%     of the facility. As of     December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  ,   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. However, we had     $2 million     of outstanding letters of credit at   December 31, 2014     and     December 31, 2013  ,   which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under this credit facility by those same amounts.  
    
  Under the     $1.4 billion     credit facility we must comply with certain covenants, including a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than     60%  .   We were in compliance with the credit facility covenants during 2014 and 2013. Our ratio of total debt to total capitalization, as those terms are defined in the credit facility, was     35.9%   at   December 31, 2014  .   We are providing this ratio as this metric is used by our lenders to monitor our leverage and is also a threshold that limits our ability to utilize this facility.    
    
  Total cash paid for interest on notes payable and long-term debt was   $209 million  ,   $210 million   and   $198 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.    
    
    Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies 
  Leases   At   December 31, 2014  , we had commitments under long-term leases requiring annual rentals on a net lease basis as follows:    

Rent expense was   $225 million  ,   $248 million   and   $258 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. In the normal course of business, we lease equipment, office buildings and other facilities under leases that include standard escalation clauses for adjusting rent payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

At   December 31, 2014  , we had commitments under agreements to outsource a portion of our information technology function, which have minimum annual payments of less than   $5 million  . 
    
  Environmental Matters     We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of the liability of total environmental remediation costs includes the use of a discount rate and takes into account that a portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. Government within contracts in process, net. Our estimates regarding remediation costs to be incurred were as follows at December 31  :    

We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our consolidated financial statements.     
    
  Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of environmental matters. However, we do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.    
    
  Environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred are: 

Financing Arrangements and Other     We issue guarantees, and banks and surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. These instruments expire on various dates through 2023. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. The stated values outstanding consisted of the following at   December 31:    

Included in guarantees and letters of credit described above were   $196 million   and   $244 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2014  , and   $233 million   and   $268 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2013  , related to our joint venture in TRS.   We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans and meet their project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation to us. We periodically evaluate the risk of TRS and other affiliates failing to satisfy their loans and meet their project performance and other contractual obligations described above.   At   December 31,

2014  ,   we believe the risk that TRS and other affiliates will not be able to perform or meet their obligations is minimal for the foreseeable future based on their current financial condition. All obligations were current at     December 31, 2014  . At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , we had an estimated liability of   $9 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, related to these guarantees and letters of credit.   The increase in letters of credit of     $514 million     in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by advance payment bonds of approximately     $500 million     related to certain international programs.    
    
  The TRS joint venture agreement was amended on June 10, 2014 to allow for termination of the joint venture by either party every three years based on the scheduled date for the designation of a successor Chief Executive Officer for the joint venture which would next occur in 2016. Termination terms and related payments are subject to negotiation between Thales S.A. (Thales) and Raytheon, but generally would include a net payment due for undistributed earnings of the joint venture companies since inception and a net payment based on the relative fair value of those companies excluding Air Command Systems International S.A.S. (ACSI). As a result, any final future termination amounts cannot be determined precisely at this time and could be different from those amounts recorded to date. However, if the joint venture were terminated as of     December 31, 2014  , we believe the termination payment we would be required to make based on a standard valuation approach would not be material. If a termination liability exceeds     $50 million  , the agreement allows the paying side to elect to make payments, inclusive of interest, in equal installments over five years to settle the liability.    
    
  In 1997, we provided a first loss guarantee of     $133 million     on     $1.3 billion     of U.S. Export-Import Bank loans (maturing in the second quarter of 2015) to the Brazilian Government related to IDS' System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program. As of   December 31, 2014  ,   the guarantee amount was     $60 million  .   Loan repayments by the Brazilian Government were current at   December 31, 2014  . 
  We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries.   At   December 31, 2014  ,   the aggregate amount of our offset agreements had an outstanding notional value of approximately     $5 billion  .   These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities, or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have historically not been required to pay any such penalties.    
    
  As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to many levels of audit and investigation by the U.S. Government relating to our contract performance and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. From time to time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracting. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. Government with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the Department of Justice has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S. and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S.

Government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations) may also be investigated or audited.     Other than as specifically disclosed herein, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate.    
     
  On July 22, 2010, Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL) was notified by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) that it had been terminated for cause on a program. The termination notice included allegations that RSL had failed to perform on certain key milestones and other matters in addition to claiming entitlement to recovery of certain losses incurred and previous payments made to RSL. We believe that RSL performed well and delivered substantial capabilities to the UKBA under the program, which has been operating successfully and providing actionable information since live operations began in May 2009. As a result of the termination notice, we adjusted our estimated amounts of revenue and cost under the program in the second quarter of 2010.     On July 29, 2010, RSL filed a dispute notice on the grounds that the termination by the UKBA was not valid. On August 18, 2010, the UKBA initiated arbitration proceedings on this issue. On March 22, 2011, the UKBA gave notice that it had presented a demand to draw on the approximately     $80 million     of letters of credit provided by RSL upon the signing of the contract with the UKBA in 2007. On March 23, 2011, the UKBA submitted a detailed claim in the arbitration of approximately      350 million   (approximately   $545 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  )   for damages and clawback of previous payments, plus interest and arbitration costs, excluding any credit for capability delivered or draw on the letters of credit. The UKBA also asserted that additional amounts may be detailed in the claim in the future if estimates of its damages change, and for continuing post-termination losses and any re-procurement costs, which have not been quantified. At RSL's request, on March 29, 2011, the Arbitration Tribunal issued an interim order restraining the UKBA from drawing down on the letters of credit pending a hearing on the issue. Following the hearing, the Tribunal lifted the restraint on the basis that, at this early stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal had not heard the evidence needed to decide the merits of whether the contractual conditions for a drawdown had been established. The Tribunal also concluded that any decision on the UKBA's right to call on the letters of credit is inextricably intertwined with the ultimate decision on the merits in the arbitration. The Tribunal also preserved RSL's right to claim damages should RSL later establish that the drawdown was not valid. As a result, on April 6, 2011, the UKBA drew the     $80 million   on the letters of credit. 
    
  As a result of the Tribunal's decision that the letters of credit are inextricably intertwined with the ultimate decision on the merits in the arbitration, we were no longer able to evaluate, independently from the overall claim, the probability of recovery of any amounts drawn on the letters of credit. We therefore recorded     $80 million   of costs related to the UKBA drawdown (UKBA LOC Adjustment), which was included in the operating expenses of our Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS) segment in the first quarter of 2011. 
    
  In June 2011, RSL submitted in the arbitration its defenses to the UKBA claim as well as substantial counterclaims in the amount of approximately      500 million   (approximately   $778 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  )   against the UKBA for the collection of receivables, damages and interest. On October 3, 2011, the UKBA filed its reply to RSL's counterclaims, and increased its claim amount by approximately      32 million  ,   to include additional civil service and post termination costs, and approximately      33 million     for interest, raising the gross amount of the UKBA claim for damages and clawback of previous payments to approximately      415 million   (approximately   $646 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  ).   On January 6, 2012, RSL filed its response to the UKBA's reply. RSL is pursuing vigorously the collection of all receivables for the program and damages in connection with the wrongful termination and mounted a strong defense to the UKBA's alleged claims for losses and previous payments. RSL has also settled substantially all subcontractor claims, novated all key subcontracts to the UKBA and agreed with the UKBA that RSL's exit obligations to operate the previously delivered capability ended in April 2011. Effective April 15, 2011, the UKBA took over responsibility for operating the previously delivered capability.     In March 2013, the UKBA updated the total net amount of its claims to approximately      302 million     (approximately     $470 million     based on foreign exchange rates as of     December 31, 2014  )   for damages, clawback of previous payments and interest, and inclusive of a credit for capability delivered by RSL. Arbitration hearings commenced in late   2013     and were completed in 2013. We continue to believe that the receivables and other assets remaining under the program for technology and services delivered of approximately $40 million at     December 31, 2014     are probable of recovery.    
    
  On August 15, 2014, RSL received a decision from the Tribunal. The Tribunal found that the UKBA had unlawfully terminated RSL for default and had therefore repudiated the eBorders contract with RSL. Accordingly, the Tribunal denied  

99 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

the UKBA s claims for damages and clawback of previous payments. In addition, the Tribunal found that the UKBA had wrongfully retained the     $80 million     it had drawn on RSL letters of credit in April 2011. The Tribunal awarded RSL approximately      185 million   (approximately   $288 million   based on foreign exchange rates as of   December 31, 2014  )   as payment for capabilities delivered, damages and other monetary relief. The Tribunal reserved ruling on costs and on the quantification of interest payable to RSL for a later date.    
    
  On September 15, 2014, the UKBA filed a challenge to the award in the London High Court. RSL is vigorously opposing such challenge. The payment of amounts awarded to RSL is now pending resolution of the challenge. Due to the inherent uncertainties of arbitration and litigation, no amounts regarding this matter were recorded in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014.    
    
  On June 29, 2012 and July 13, 2012, we received a contracting officer s final decision (COFD) for 2004 and 2005 incurred costs at SAS. The COFDs demand a total payment of     $241 million     for costs, interest and penalties associated with several issues, the largest of which relates to specific research and development and capital projects undertaken by SAS between 2000 and 2005. To date, no COFDs have been provided for 2000 to 2003 periods at SAS on these issues. The Government alleges that the costs incurred on the projects should have been charged directly to U.S. Government contracts rather than through indirect rates and that these costs should not be recoverable. We strongly disagree with the Government's position. We have requested a deferment of the payment and in February and May 2013, we filed complaints in the U.S. COFC challenging the 2004 and 2005 COFDs, respectively. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot estimate a range of potential loss. We believe that we appropriately charged the disputed costs based on government accounting standards and applicable precedent and properly disclosed our approach to the Government. We also believe that in many cases, the statute of limitations has run on the issues. Based upon the foregoing, we do not expect the results of the COFDs to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.     
  In addition, various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against, or initiated by, us. We do not expect any of these proceedings to result in any additional liability or gains that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   In connection with certain of our legal matters, we may be entitled to insurance recovery for qualified legal costs. We do not expect any insurance recovery to have a material impact on the financial exposure that could result from these matters.    
  Product Warranty   We provide for product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales for which we recognize revenue upon delivery. 
    
  Activity related to product warranty accruals was as follows:    

We account for warranty provision costs incurred under our long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of progress as contracts costs, as the estimation of these costs is integral in determining the price of the related long-term contracts. The table above excludes these costs.

Note 11: Stockholders  Equity 
  The changes in shares of our common stock outstanding were as follows:    

On May 27, 2010, our stockholders approved the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan pursuant to which we may grant restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock grants, stock options and stock appreciation rights. 
    
  In November 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to     $2.0 billion     of our outstanding common stock. At     December 31, 2014  , we had approximately     $1.5 billion     available under this repurchase program.     Share repurchases will take place from time to time at management s discretion depending on market conditions.    
    
  Share repurchases also include shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option awards issued to employees.     
    
  Our share repurchases were as follows:    

In March 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a   10%   increase to our annual dividend payout rate from   $2.20   to   $2.42   per share. Our Board of Directors declared dividends of   $2.42  ,   $2.20   and   $2.00   per share in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. Dividends are subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors. 
    
  Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
  EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders and unvested share-based payment awards was as follows:    

Basic and diluted EPS from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders and unvested share-based payment awards were earnings of   $0.21  , earnings of   $0.20   and a loss of less than   $0.01   for   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively.

Income attributable to participating securities was as follows:   

           (1) 
    Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax attributable to participating securities was a loss of less than   $1 million   for   2012  . 
       
  The weighted-average shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS were as follows:    

There were no stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price (anti-dilutive) that were excluded from our calculation of diluted EPS in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  . Stock options to purchase the following number of shares of common stock had exercise prices that were less than the average market price (dilutive) of our common stock and were included in our calculations of diluted EPS:    

(2) 
    Stock options included in the calculation of EPS (dilutive) were less than   1 million   for   2014  . 
       
  Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to   200 million   shares of preferred stock,   $0.01   par value per share, in multiple series with terms as determined by them. There were   no   shares of preferred stock outstanding at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  . 

Note 12: Stock-based Compensation Plans 
  Stock-based compensation expense and the associated tax benefits were as follows: 

At   December 31, 2014  , there was   $161 million   of compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.6   years. 
    
  At   December 31, 2014  , we had stock-based compensation awards outstanding under a number of stock plans, including our 2010 Stock Plan. Future grants of awards will be made from the 2010 Stock Plan and not from our prior plans. 
    
  Shares issued as a result of stock awards, stock option exercises or conversion of restricted stock unit awards will be funded through the issuance of new shares. Of the   41.8 million   shares authorized under our stock plans, there were   7.0 million   shares available for awards under such plans as of   December 31, 2014  . 
    
  Restricted Stock 
  The 2010 Stock Plan provides for the award of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees, officers, nonemployee directors and consultants. Awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights generally are made by the MDCC and are compensatory in nature. These awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the MDCC, generally four years for employee awards and one year for nonemployee directors. Restricted stock awards entitle the recipient to full dividend and voting rights beginning on the  

102 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

date of grant. Non-vested shares are restricted as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances. At the date of award each share of restricted stock is credited to common stock at par value. The fair value of restricted stock, calculated under the intrinsic value method at the date of award, is charged to income as compensation expense generally over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital. 
    
  During   2014  , we awarded   0.3 million   restricted stock units (RSUs) to retirement-eligible employees. These awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (MDCC) and are compensatory in nature. The RSUs continue to vest, but do not accelerate, on the scheduled vesting dates into retirement subject to the employee's compliance with certain post-employment covenants. Due to the continued vesting provisions of the RSUs into retirement, the Company recognized all of the stock compensation expense associated with the RSUs in   2014  , approximately   $25 million   pretax,   $17 million   after-tax, rather than over the vesting period of the awards. 
    
  Restricted stock activity was as follows:    

Long-term Performance Plan (LTPP) 
  In 2004, we established the LTPP, which provides for restricted stock unit awards granted from our stock plans to our senior leadership. These awards vest at the end of a three-year performance cycle based upon the achievement of specific pre-established levels of performance.  
    
  The performance goals for the three outstanding performance cycles at   December 31, 2014  , are independent of each other and based on three metrics, as defined in the award agreements: return on invested capital (ROIC), weighted at   50%  ; total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group, weighted at   25%  ; and cumulative free cash flow from continuing operations (CFCF), weighted at   25%  . 
    
  The ultimate award, which is determined at the end of each of the three-year performance cycles, can range from   zero   to   200%   of the target award and also includes dividend equivalents, which are not included in the table below. Compensation expense for the awards is recognized over the performance period based upon the value determined under the intrinsic value method for the CFCF and ROIC portions of the award and the Monte Carlo simulation method for the TSR portion of the award using historic volatility. Compensation expense for the CFCF and ROIC portions of the awards will be adjusted based upon the expected achievement of those performance goals. 

103 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

LTPP activity related to the expected units was as follows:    

The increase above relates to changes in the amount of expected awards as achievement is measured against performance goals. 
    
  Stock Options 
  In 2004, we changed the primary form of our broad-based equity compensation from stock options to restricted stock. There have been no stock options granted since 2005. 
    
  The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was less than   $1 million  ,   $3 million   and   $23 million  , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended   December 31, 2014  ,   2013   and   2012   was   $3 million  ,   $21 million   and   $38 million  , respectively. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , there were   2 thousand   and   52 thousand   outstanding options, respectively, all of which were fully vested and exercisable.   No   options vested during the years ended   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  . 
      
  Note 13: Pension and Other Employee Benefits 
  We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries (Pension Benefits). Our primary pension obligations relate to our domestic IRS qualified pension plans. We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees and to eligible employees upon retirement through other postretirement benefit plans (Other Benefits). 
    
  The fair value of plan assets for our domestic and foreign Pension Benefits plans was as follows: 

We maintain a defined contribution plan that includes a 401(k) plan. Covered employees hired or rehired after January 1, 2007, are eligible for a Company contribution based on age and service, instead of participating in our pension plans. These and other covered employees are eligible to contribute up to a specific percentage of their pay to the 401(k) plan. We match the employee s contribution, generally up to   3%   or   4%   of the employee s pay, which is invested in the same way as  

104 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

employee contributions. Total expense for our contributions was   $274 million  ,   $279 million   and   $272 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. 
    
  At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , there was   $14.9 billion   and   $14.4 billion   invested in our defined contribution plan, respectively. At   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  ,   $1.4 billion   of these amounts were invested in our stock fund. 
    
  We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. We have set aside certain assets in a separate trust, which we expect to be used to pay for trust obligations. The fair value of marketable securities held in trust, which are considered Level 1 assets under the fair value hierarchy, consisted of the following at December 31: 

Included in marketable securities held in trust in the table above was   $328 million   and   $304 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively, related to the nonqualified defined contribution plans. The liabilities related to the nonqualified defined contribution plans were   $327 million   and   $300 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. 
    
  We also maintain additional contractual pension benefits agreements for certain executive officers. The liability associated with such agreements was   $39 million   and   $34 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. 
    
  Contributions and Benefit Payments 
  We may make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined in accordance with the Pension Protection Act (PPA), which amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) rules and are affected by the actual return on plan assets and plan funded status. The funding requirements under the PPA require us to fully fund our pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based upon the funded status at the beginning of the year.     
    
  In July 2012, the Surface Transportation Extension Act, which is also referred to as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (STE Act), was passed by Congress and signed by the President. The STE Act includes a provision for temporary pension funding relief due to the low interest rate environment. The provision adjusts the 24-month average high quality corporate bond rates used to determine the PPA funded status so that they are within a floor and cap, or  corridor,  based on the 25-year average of corporate bond rates. The STE Act gradually phases out this interest rate provision beginning in 2013. In August 2014, the pension provisions of the STE Act were extended as part of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA). As a result, the interest rates used to determine PPA funded status will continue to be adjusted within a  corridor  and do not begin to phase out until 2018. The HATFA impacts CAS expense as well because CAS Harmonization incorporates the PPA interest rate into CAS calculations.    
    
  We made the following contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during the years ended December 31:     

We periodically evaluate whether to make additional discretionary contributions. We expect to make required contributions of approximately   $335 million   and   $25 million   to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, in   2015  .

  The weighted-average year-end benefit obligation discount rate for our domestic Pension Benefits plans was   4.08%   and   5.08%   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. Our foreign Pension Benefits plan assumptions have been included in the Pension Benefits assumptions in the table above. 
    
  The long-term ROA represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. The long-term ROA used to calculate net periodic pension cost is set annually at the beginning of each year. Given the long-term nature of the ROA assumption, which we believe should not be solely reactive to short-term market conditions that may not persist, we expect the long-term ROA to remain unchanged unless there are significant changes in our investment strategy, the underlying economic assumptions, or other major factors. To establish our long-term ROA assumption, we employ a  building block  approach. As part of our annual process for determining whether it is appropriate to change our long-term ROA assumption, we first review the existing long-term ROA assumption against a statistically determined reasonable range of outcomes. For purposes of determining the long-term ROA assumption for 2014 and prior, we considered this range to be between the 25th and 75th percentile likelihood of achieving a long-term return over future years (consistent with Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 27 in effect at the time). Therefore, it is less than 25 percent likely that the long-term return of the pension plan would fall below or above the 25th and 75th percentiles points, respectively (i.e., it is 50 percent likely that the long-term return of the pension plan will be within the 25th and 75th percentile range). The building block approach and the reasonable range of outcomes are based upon our asset allocation assumptions and long-term capital market assumptions. Such assumptions incorporate the economic outlook for various asset classes over short- and long-term periods and also take into consideration other factors, including historical market performance, inflation and interest rates. The reasonable range of long-term returns that was used to validate the long-term ROA assumption for the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for     2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , are shown below.  

109 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

Our long-term domestic ROA of 8.75% fell between the 60th 65th percentile, 65th 70th percentile and 60th 65th percentile of the reasonable range for     2014  ,   2013   and   2012     respectively. The 50th percentile of the reasonable range used to develop each of the     2014  ,   2013   and   2012     long-term ROA was 7.59%, 7.51% and 7.99%, respectively. 
    
  Once our long-term ROA has been determined, we review historical averages and patterns of returns to confirm reasonability of our long-term ROA assumption compared to past results. While history is not solely indicative of future market expectations, it does provide insight into general historical trends and long-term asset performance. In validating the     2014     long-term ROA assumption, we reviewed our pension plan asset performance since 1986. Our average annual actual rate of return since 1986 of 9.19%, determined on an arithmetic basis, exceeds our estimated 8.75% assumed return. Arithmetic annual averages represent the simple average returns over independent annual periods, whereas geometric returns reflect the compound average returns of dependent annual periods. The average annual actual return on a geometric basis for the same period was 8.50%. In addition, the actual annual returns have exceeded our long-term ROA assumption of 8.75% in six of the past ten years. Because our 2014 long-term ROA assumption of 8.75% for our domestic pension plans was within the reasonable range and our historical trends and averages did not indicate a trend or pattern of returns significantly above or below our existing assumption, we determined our long-term ROA assumption for our domestic pension plans in     2014     would remain at 8.75%, consistent with our     2013     assumption. 
    
  Our domestic pension plans  actual rates of return were approximately 6%, 15% and 12% for     2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. The difference between the actual rate of return and our long-term ROA assumption is included in deferred losses.    
    
  The long-term ROA assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans are based on the asset allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of our Pension Benefits plans. 
    
  For purposes of determining pension expense under GAAP,   a  corridor  approach may be elected and applied in the recognition of asset and liability gains or losses which limits expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10 percent of the projected benefit obligation or the calculated "market-related value" of assets. We do not use a  corridor  approach in the calculation of FAS expense.   
    
  The effect of a   1%   increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend rate for each future year for the aggregate of service cost and interest cost is less than   $1 million   and for the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is a   $7 million   increase or decrease. 
    
  Plan Assets 
  Substantially all our domestic Pension Benefits Plan (Plan) assets, which consist of investments in cash and cash equivalents, publicly traded U.S. and international equity securities, private equity funds, private real estate funds, fixed-income securities, commingled funds and other investments such as insurance contracts and derivatives, are held in a master trust, which was established for the investment of assets of our Company-sponsored retirement plans. The assets of the master trust are overseen by our Investment Committee comprised of members of senior management drawn from appropriate diversified levels of the executive management team. 
    
  The Investment Committee is responsible for setting the policy that provides the framework for management of the Plan assets. In accordance with its responsibilities and charter, the Investment Committee meets on a regular basis to review the performance of the Plan assets and compliance with the investment policy. The policy sets forth an investment structure for managing Plan assets, including setting the asset allocation ranges, which are expected to provide an appropriate level of overall diversification and total investment return over the long term while maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay the benefits of the Plan. Asset allocation ranges are set to produce the highest return on investment taking into account investment risks that are prudent and reasonable given prevailing market conditions. In developing the asset allocation ranges, third-party asset allocation studies are periodically performed that consider the current and expected positions of the plan assets and funded status. Based on these studies and other appropriate information, the Investment Committee establishes asset allocation ranges taking into account acceptable risk targets and associated returns.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

The investment policy asset allocation ranges for the Plan, as set by the Investment Committee, for the year ended   December 31, 2014   were as follows: 

The Investment Committee appoints the investment fiduciary, who is responsible for making investment decisions within the framework of the Investment Policy, setting the long-term target allocation within the investment policy asset allocation ranges and for supervising the internal pension investment team. The pension investment team is comprised of experienced financial managers, who are all employees of the Company. The investment fiduciary reports back to the Investment Committee. During times of unusual market conditions, the investment fiduciary may seek authorization from the Investment Committee to change the investing allocation ranges to reasonably limit excessive volatility or other undesirable consequences. 
    
  Taking into account the asset allocation ranges, the investment fiduciary determines the specific allocation of the Plan s investments within various asset classes. The Plan utilizes select investment strategies which are executed through separate account or fund structures with external investment managers who demonstrate experience and expertise in the appropriate asset classes and styles. The selection of investment managers is done with careful evaluation of all aspects of performance and risk, due diligence of internal operations and controls, reputation, systems evaluation and a review of investment managers' policies and processes. The Plan also utilizes funds that track an index and are highly liquid. Investment performance is monitored frequently against appropriate benchmarks and tracked to compliance guidelines with the assistance of third-party performance evaluation tools and metrics. 
    
  Consistent with the objective of maximizing return while minimizing risk, multiple investment strategies are employed to diversify risk such that no single investment or manager holding presents a significant exposure to the total investment portfolio. Plan assets are invested in numerous diversified strategies with the intent to minimize correlations. This allows for diversification of returns. Plan assets can be invested in funds that track an index and are designed to achieve diversification across the related indices. The Plan had   $4 billion   invested in such funds across   four   indices as of   December 31, 2014  . Other than funds that track an index, no individual investment strategy represented more than   5%   of the Plan as of   December 31, 2014  . Further, within each separate account strategy, guidelines are established which set forth the list of authorized investments, the typical portfolio characteristics and diversification required by limiting the amount that can be invested by sector, country and issuer.  
    
  The Plan s investments are stated at fair value. Investments in equity securities (common and preferred) are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. Investments in fixed-income securities are generally valued using methods based upon market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are generally recognized by institutional traders. Investments in private equity funds and private real estate funds are estimated at fair market value which primarily utilizes net asset values reported by the investment manager or fund administrator. We review independently-appraised values, audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the net asset values. For the limited group of securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value, additional information is obtained from the investment manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value.

The Plan limits the use of derivatives through direct or separate account investments such that the derivatives used are liquid and able to be readily valued in the market. Derivative usage in separate account structures is limited to hedging purposes or to gain market exposure in a non-speculative manner. The fair market value of the Plan s derivatives through direct or separate account investments was approximately   $(7) million   and   $20 million   as of   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. 
    
  In addition, assets are held in trust for non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans, primarily in the U.K. and Canada, which are governed locally in accordance with specific jurisdictional requirements. These assets are overseen by local management in Canada and by trustees with a combination of members representing plan participants and local management in the U.K. Investments in the non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans consist primarily of fixed-income securities and equity securities and had a fair market value of   $868 million   and   $806 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. These investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as well as significant observable inputs (Level 2). Investments with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are immaterial in the non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans. 
    
  The fair market value of assets related to our Other Benefits was   $418 million   and   $431 million   as of   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively. These assets included   $185 million   and   $189 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively, that were invested in the master trust described above and are therefore invested in the same assets described above. The remaining investments are held within Voluntary Employees  Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts. The assets of the VEBA trusts are also overseen by the Investment Committee and managed by the same investment fiduciary that manages the master trust s investments. These assets are generally invested in mutual funds, and are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as well as significant observable inputs (Level 2). There were no Level 3 investments in the VEBA trusts at   December 31, 2014   or   December 31, 2013  . 
    
  The table below details assets by category for our VEBA trusts. These assets consist primarily of publicly-traded equity securities and publicly-traded fixed-income securities. 

Note 14: Income Taxes 
  The provision for federal and foreign income taxes consisted of the following:    

115 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

The expense for income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following:    

In December 2014, Congress enacted legislation that reinstated the Research   Development (R D) tax credit that was retroactive to the beginning of 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a full year benefit of approximately   $30 million   related to the 2014 R D tax credit. 
  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We have participated in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) program since 2011. We continue to participate in the CAP program for the 2013 and 2014 tax years. In the first quarter of 2014 the IRS completed the examination for the 2012 tax year, which completed all examinations through 2012. We are also under audit by multiple state and foreign tax authorities. 
  During 2013, the IRS completed its examination of our 2009 and 2012 tax years and we received final approval from the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of a refund claim related to the 2011 tax year. As a result of closing the federal audit examinations, our unrecognized tax benefits decreased by approximately   $70 million  , inclusive of interest, the majority of which did not impact our income from continuing operations. 
  During 2012, we received final approval from the IRS and the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of an IRS Appeals Division settlement for the 2006-2008 IRS examination cycle (2012 Tax Settlement). As a result, our unrecognized tax benefits decreased by approximately   $24 million  , inclusive of interest, all of which increased our income from continuing operations.   

At   December 31, 2014  , foreign earnings of approximately   $384 million   have been retained by foreign subsidiaries for reinvestment. In the first quarter of 2014, a foreign subsidiary authorized and completed a transaction which resulted in a taxable dividend of approximately   $115 million  . The transaction does not affect our indefinite reinvestment assertion because it generated a net tax benefit of approximately   $80 million  . No provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings have been indefinitely invested or are expected to be remitted substantially free of additional tax. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexity of laws and regulations, the varying tax treatment of alternative repatriation scenarios, and the variation due to multiple potential assumptions relating to the timing of any future repatriation.  
    
  We made the following net tax payments during the years ended December 31: 

We believe that our income tax reserves are adequate; however, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than amounts accrued and reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, we could record adjustments to  

116 

           Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (CONTINUED) 

the amounts for federal, foreign and state tax-related liabilities in the future as we revise estimates or we settle or otherwise resolve the underlying matters. In the ordinary course of business, we may take new positions that could increase or decrease our unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. 
    
  The balance of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, was   $104 million   and   $118 million   at   December 31, 2014   and   December 31, 2013  , respectively, the majority of which would affect earnings if recognized. We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. At   December 31, 2014  ,   December 31, 2013   and   December 31, 2012  , we had   $6 million  ,   $5 million   and   $17 million   of interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, which, net of the federal tax benefit, was approximately   $4 million  ,   $3 million   and   $11 million  , respectively. 
    
  A rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:    

It   is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months our unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, may decrease by up to   $100 million  , as a result of resolving various issues in the currently open cycles, including the R D tax credit. We expect that the majority of the decrease would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. 
  We generally account for our state income tax expense as a deferred contract cost, as we can generally recover this expense through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. We include this deferred amount in contracts in process, net until allocated to our contracts, which generally occurs upon payment or when otherwise agreed as allocable with the U.S. Government. Net state income tax expense allocated to our contracts was   $41 million  ,   $42 million   and   $78 million   in   2014  ,   2013   and   2012  , respectively. We include state income tax expense allocated to our contracts in administrative and selling expenses. 
    
  Deferred income taxes consisted of the following at December 31:     

As of   December 31, 2014  , we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately   $392 million  , of which   $370 million   was generated in the U.K. We believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize this deferred tax asset, as any net operating loss generated in the U.K. may be carried forward indefinitely.

We must calculate our pension and other postretirement benefits (PRB) costs under both Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under GAAP and U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not indicative of the funding requirements for pension and PRB plans that we determine by other factors. CAS prescribes the allocation to and recovery of pension and PRB costs on U.S. Government contracts. The results of each segment only include pension and PRB expense as determined under CAS. The CAS requirements for pension costs and its calculation methodology differ from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. As a result, while both FAS and CAS use long-term assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of pension and PRB cost. The FAS/CAS Adjustment, which is reported as a separate line in our segment results above, represents the difference between our pension and PRB expense or income under FAS in accordance with GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under CAS.
