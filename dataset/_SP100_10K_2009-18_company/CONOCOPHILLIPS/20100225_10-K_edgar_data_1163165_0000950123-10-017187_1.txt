Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

CORPORATE STRUCTURE 

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in
the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger
between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

Our business is organized into six operating segments:

Exploration and Production (E P)  This segment primarily explores for, produces,
transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a
worldwide basis. 

Midstream  This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by
ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly
in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50
percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. 

Refining and Marketing (R M)  This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. 

LUKOIL Investment  This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares
of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia.
At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and
20.09 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. 

Chemicals  This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. 

Emerging Businesses  This segment represents our investment in new technologies or
businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 

At December 31, 2009, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 30,000 people.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25 Segment Disclosures and Related
Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E P)  

At December 31, 2009, our E P segment represented 66 percent of ConocoPhillips  total assets. This
segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural
gas liquids and bitumen on a worldwide basis. Operations to liquefy natural gas and transport the
resulting liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also included in the E P segment. At December 31, 2009,
our E P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria,
Algeria and Russia.

The E P segment does not include the financial results or statistics from our equity investment in
the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which are reported in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result,
references to results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E P segment
discussion exclude amounts related to our investment in LUKOIL. However, our share of LUKOIL is
included in the  Oil and Gas Operations  disclosures, as well as in the net proved reserves table
shown below.

The information listed below appears in the  Oil and Gas Operations  disclosures following the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:

Proved worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic
oil reserves. 

Net production of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic
oil. 

Average sales prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and
synthetic oil. 

Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). 

Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells. 

Developed and undeveloped acreage. 

2 

Table of Contents   

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the  Oil and Gas
Operations  disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 65
percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the
 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE
based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE.

In 2009, E P s worldwide production, including its share of equity affiliates  production
other than LUKOIL, averaged 1,854,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), compared with
1,789,000 in 2008. During 2009, 755,000 BOED were produced in the United States, a decrease from
775,000 in 2008. Production from our international E P operations averaged 1,099,000 BOED in 2009,
an increase compared with 1,014,000 in 2008. Worldwide production increased primarily due to new
developments in the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Canada, Vietnam and Norway, in addition to less
unplanned downtime. These increases were partially offset by field decline.

E P s worldwide annual average crude oil and natural gas liquids sales price decreased 37 percent,
from $88.91 per barrel in 2008 to $55.63 in 2009. E P s average annual worldwide natural gas sales
price decreased 48 percent, from $8.27 per thousand cubic feet in 2008 to $4.26 in 2009.

E P UNITED STATES

In 2009, U.S. E P operations contributed 40 percent of E P s worldwide liquids production and
41 percent of natural gas production, compared with 43 percent for each in 2008.

Alaska 

Greater Prudhoe Area  

The Greater Prudhoe Area is composed of the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as
the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska s North
Slope, is the site of a large

3 

Table of Contents   

waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant that processes
and re-injects natural gas into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay s satellites are Aurora, Borealis,
Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne Fields are
part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. We have a 36.1 percent nonoperator interest in all fields
within the Greater Prudhoe Area. Net oil and natural gas liquids production from the Greater
Prudhoe Area averaged 119,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared with 123,000 in 2008.

Greater Kuparuk Area  

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, composed of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn,
Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located about 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Our
ownership interest in the area is approximately 55 percent. Field installations include three
central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water. The natural gas is either
used for fuel or compressed for re-injection. Net oil production from the area averaged 65,000
barrels per day in 2009, compared with 67,000 in 2008.

Western North Slope  

On the Western North Slope we operate the Colville River Unit, composed of the Alpine Field and
three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located about 30 miles west of Kuparuk.
Our ownership interest in the area is approximately 78 percent. Net production in 2009 was 68,000
barrels of oil per day, compared with 70,000 in 2008. Further development of potential satellite
fields west of Alpine and into the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPRA) is contingent upon the
receipt of permit approvals and additional exploration appraisal work. Planned development of one
of these satellites, the Alpine West CD5 Project, has been postponed due to the denial of a key
permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in February 2010. We expect to appeal their decision.

Cook Inlet Area  

We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Plant in the Cook
Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit, while we own 33.3 percent
of the Beluga River Unit. Net production in 2009 from the Cook Inlet Area averaged 85 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas, compared with 88 million in 2008. Production from the North
Cook Inlet Unit is used primarily to supply our share of gas to the Kenai LNG Plant and also as a
backup supply to local utilities, while gas from the Beluga River Unit is primarily sold to local
utilities and is used as backup supply to the Kenai LNG Plant.

We have a 70 percent interest in the Kenai LNG Plant, which supplies LNG to two utility companies
in Japan. We sold 21 net billion cubic feet of LNG in 2009, compared with 27 billion in 2008.

Exploration  

In a February 2008 lease sale conducted by the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) under the Outer
Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, we successfully bid, and were awarded 10-year primary
term leases, on 98 blocks in the Chukchi Sea, for total bid payments of $506 million. Various
special interest groups have brought two separate lawsuits challenging (1) the DOI s entire OCS
leasing program, and (2) the Chukchi Sea lease sale conducted by the DOI under that program. In
the first suit, the Court ordered the DOI to reconsider one aspect of its OCS leasing program. The
results of the DOI s reconsideration are expected during the first quarter of 2010. In the second
suit, briefs have been filed on behalf of the defendants, including the DOI, in support of the
Chukchi Sea lease sale, and a decision is expected later in 2010. We continue to progress plans
for drilling an exploration well on our Chukchi Sea leases no earlier than 2012. In January 2010,
we exchanged a 25 percent working interest in 50 of these leases for cash consideration and
additional working interests in the Lower Tertiary play of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

Two exploration wells were drilled in the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, located in the NPRA. One of
the wells was expensed as a dry hole, while the second well encountered hydrocarbons. We are
evaluating the potential for future development of this latest discovery.

Transportation  

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an
800-mile pipeline that is part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 28.3 percent
ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok
Pipelines on the North Slope.

Table of Contents   

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North
Slope production, using five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering
third-party vessels as necessary.

In 2008, ConocoPhillips and BP plc formed a limited liability company to progress the pipeline
project named Denali The Alaska Gas Pipeline. The project would move Alaska natural gas to North
American markets. Denali has continued to progress the project in preparation for its open season
in 2010, during which the pipeline company will seek customers to make long-term firm
transportation commitments to the project. There is a pipeline project competing with Denali that
is structured under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act.

U.S. Lower 48 

Gulf of Mexico  

At year-end 2009, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico mainly consisted of
one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:

75 percent operator interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784. 

16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi
Canyon Area. 

16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of
the Ursa Field. 

12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in
the Green Canyon Area. 

Net production from our Gulf of Mexico properties averaged 21,000 barrels per day of liquids and
28 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2009, compared with 18,000 barrels per day and 24
million cubic feet per day in 2008.

Onshore  

Our 2009 onshore production principally consisted of natural gas, with the majority of production
located in the San Juan Basin, Permian Basin, Lobo Trend, Bossier Trend, and panhandles of Texas
and Oklahoma. We also have operations in the Wind River, Anadarko and Fort Worth Basins, as well
as in East Texas and northern and southern Louisiana. Other onshore ownership includes properties
in the Williston Basin, the Piceance Basin and the Cedar Creek Anticline.

Onshore activities in 2009 were mostly centered on continued optimization and development of
existing assets. Combined net production from all Lower 48 onshore fields in 2009 averaged 1,899
million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 145,000 barrels per day of liquids, compared with
1,970 million cubic feet per day and 147,000 barrels per day in 2008.

The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes the
majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. Additionally, we continue to pursue
development opportunities in three conventional formations in the San Juan Basin. Net production
from San Juan averaged 903 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 49,000 barrels per day of
liquids in 2009, compared with 863 million cubic feet per day and 48,000 barrels per day in 2008.

Transportation  

In 2006, we acquired a 24 percent interest in West2East Pipeline LLC, which merged into Rockies
Express Pipeline LLC in December 2009. In November 2009, Rockies Express completed construction of
a 1,679-mile natural gas pipeline from Colorado to Ohio, which has the capacity to deliver 1.8
billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to eastern markets. We increased our ownership interest
to 25 percent upon project completion.

Exploration  

During 2009, we participated in two significant discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We
hold an 18 percent interest in the Tiber discovery and a 40 percent interest in the Shenandoah
discovery. Both discoveries require future appraisal drilling. In addition, we were the
successful bidder on 27 blocks in the March and August 2009 federal offshore lease sales. At year
end, we had interests in 287 lease blocks totaling

5 

Table of Contents   

1.1 million net acres in the Gulf of Mexico. In January 2010, we exchanged a 25 percent working
interest in 50 of our leases in the Chukchi Sea for cash consideration and additional working
interests in the Lower Tertiary play of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

We drilled and completed 52 gross onshore exploration wells. The majority of the wells were
located in the Bakken play in the Williston Basin and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett play. We have
seen encouraging results from initial wells in our Eagle Ford play in South Texas where we have
accumulated over 240,000 acres. Other areas with active exploration drilling programs included
Wyoming, Colorado and East Texas.

E P EUROPE

In 2009, E P operations in Europe contributed 23 percent of E P s worldwide liquids production,
compared with 24 percent in 2008. European operations contributed 18 percent of natural gas
production in 2009, compared with 20 percent in 2008. Our European assets are principally located
in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.

Norway 

We operate and hold a 35.1 percent interest in the Greater Ekofisk Area, located approximately
200 miles offshore Norway in the North Sea. The Greater Ekofisk Area is composed of four producing
fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Net production in 2009 from the Greater Ekofisk Area was
92,000 barrels of liquids per day and 89 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with
99,000 barrels per day and 100 million cubic feet per day in 2008.

We also have varying ownership interests in other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of the
North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, including:

24.3 percent interest in the Heidrun Field. 

20 percent interest in the Alvheim Field. 

10.3 percent interest in the Statfjord Field. 

23.3 percent interest in the Huldra Field. 

1.6 percent interest in the Troll Field. 

9.1 percent interest in the Visund Field. 

6.2 percent interest in the Grane Field. 

2.4 percent interest in the Oseberg Area. 

Net production from these and other fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the
Norwegian Sea averaged 68,000 barrels of liquids per day and 128 million cubic feet of natural gas
per day in 2009, compared with 68,000 barrels per day and 139 million cubic feet per day in 2008.

Transportation  

We have interests in the transportation and processing infrastructure in the Norwegian sector of
the North Sea, including interests in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System and in Gassled, which owns
most of the Norwegian gas transportation system.

Exploration  

We participated in eight wells in 2009, with six of the wells encountering hydrocarbons. Two
discoveries were made on the Visund East flank, two discoveries were made in the Oseberg Area and
two discoveries were made in the Alvheim Area. We were also awarded an additional 128,000 acres in
2009.

United Kingdom 

In addition to our 58.7 percent interest in the Britannia natural gas and condensate field, we own
50 percent of Britannia Operator Limited, the operator of the field. We also have an 83.5 percent
interest and a 75 percent interest in the Callanish and Brodgar Britannia satellite fields,
respectively. Net production from Britannia and its satellite fields averaged 304 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day and 40,000 barrels of liquids per day in 2009, compared with 277
million cubic feet per day and 24,000 barrels per day in 2008.

Table of Contents   

We operate and hold a 36.5 percent interest in the Judy/Joanne Fields, which together make up
J-Block. Additionally, our operated Jade Field, in which we hold a 32.5 percent interest, produces
from a wellhead platform and pipeline tied to the J-Block facilities. Together, these fields
produced a net 12,000 barrels of liquids per day and 96 million cubic feet of natural gas per day
in 2009,  compared with 13,000 barrels per day and 88 million cubic feet per day in 2008.

Our various ownership interests in 18 producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous
Areas of the southern North Sea yielded average net production in 2009 of 185 million cubic feet
per day of natural gas, compared with 241 million in 2008.

We also have ownership interests in several other producing fields in the U.K. sector of the North
Sea. Net production from these fields averaged 16,000 barrels of liquids per day and 12 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2009, compared with 17,000 barrels per day and 14 million
cubic feet per day in 2008.

In the Atlantic Margin, we have a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field. Net production in 2009
averaged 12,000 barrels of liquids per day, compared with 11,000 in 2008.

The Millom, Dalton and Calder Fields in the East Irish Sea, in which we have a 100 percent
ownership interest, are operated on our behalf by a third party. Net production in 2009 averaged
60 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with 43 million in 2008.

Transportation  

The Interconnector Pipeline, linking the United Kingdom and Belgium, facilitates marketing natural
gas produced in the United Kingdom throughout Europe. Our 10 percent equity share allows us to
ship approximately 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in continental Europe,
and our reverse-flow rights provide an 85 million cubic feet per day import capability into the
United Kingdom.

We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals, in which we have 29.3 percent and 50
percent ownership interests, respectively. We also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the
Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party, in the United Kingdom.

Exploration  

We participated in three exploration wells in 2009. One well was a discovery, one was expensed as
a dry hole and the third was drilling at year end. The discovery was made in the Southern Gas
Basin and began production in 2009.

Poland 

Exploration   

In 2009, we entered into a shale gas venture in Poland that provides us with the opportunity to
evaluate and earn a 70 percent interest in six exploration licenses in the Baltic Basin. We
acquired seismic data in 2009 and intend to drill our first well in 2010.

E P CANADA

In 2009, E P operations in Canada contributed 11 percent of E P s worldwide liquids production,
compared with 10 percent in 2008. Canadian operations contributed 22 percent of E P s worldwide

Surmont  

We operate and have a 50 percent interest in the Surmont oil sands lease, located approximately 35
miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Surmont project uses an enhanced thermal oil recovery
method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The average net production of bitumen from
Surmont during 2009 was 7,000 barrels per day, compared with 6,000 barrels per day in 2008, with
net peak production of 12,000 barrels per day expected in 2013. Surmont Phase II was sanctioned in
2009 and is expected to begin producing in 2015, increasing Surmont s net production to 50,000
barrels per day in 2017.

FCCL  

In 2007, we formed two 50/50 business ventures with EnCana Corporation (now Cenovus Energy Inc.) to
create an integrated North American heavy oil business: FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream
general partnership, and WRB Refining LLC, a U.S. downstream limited liability company. FCCL s
assets, operated by Cenovus, consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake SAGD bitumen projects,
both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Our share of
FCCL s production increased to 43,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared with  30,000 barrels per day
in 2008, primarily due to Foster Creek Phases 1D and 1E commencing operations late in the first
quarter of 2009 and continuing to ramp-up throughout the year. Construction of Christina Lake
Phase 1C continued through the year, and in the fourth quarter of 2009, we sanctioned Christina
Lake Phase 1D. See the Refining and Marketing (R M) section for information on WRB.

Syncrude Canada Ltd.  

We own a 9 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. (SCL) joint venture, created for the
purpose of mining shallow deposits of oil sands, extracting the bitumen, and upgrading it into a
light sweet synthetic crude oil called Syncrude. The primary plant and facilities are located at
Mildred Lake, about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. SCL, as operator of the joint
venture, holds eight oil sands leases and the associated surface rights, of which our share is
approximately 22,400 net acres. Net production averaged 23,000 barrels per day in 2009, compared
with 22,000 in 2008.

Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project  

We are working with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers 
Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline and gathering system, which is proposed
to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established
markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake gas field, one of the
primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta, which would anchor the pipeline development. The Joint
Review Panel, an independent body appointed by the Minister of Environment to evaluate the
potential impacts of the project on the environment and lives of the people in the project area,
conditionally recommended approval of the project in December 2009. We anticipate the Mackenzie
Delta Producers  Group will continue to pursue needed regulatory authorizations, but detailed
engineering work has been deferred pending resolution with the federal government on the fiscal and
commercial framework.

Exploration  

We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, onshore western
Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region, and the Arctic Islands. During 2009, we began
drilling an exploration well in the Laurentian Basin, located offshore eastern Canada that
continued into 2010. We also acquired an additional 900,000 acres in the Laurentian Basin in 2009.
In western Canada, we participated in 27 wells resulting in 23 discoveries. We also acquired an
additional 71,000 acres, including over 22,000 acres in the Horn River shale gas play, increasing
our position to nearly 100,000 acres. In the Beaufort Sea Region, we acquired additional interest
in the Amauligak Strategic Discovery License.

Exploration  

At year-end 2009, we held ownership interests in four exploration blocks in Peru. Final
preparations are under way for a 2D seismic program scheduled for 2010 in Block 39. We operate
Blocks 123, 124 and 129, and are continuing preparations for a 2D seismic program scheduled to
commence in the first quarter of 2010. We relinquished Block 104 during 2009.

Ecuador 

In April 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated
arbitration before the World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) against The Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador as a result of the newly-enacted Windfall
Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite
a restraining order issued by the ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington
and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil. As a result, our assets in Ecuador
were effectively expropriated. In the third quarter of 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Block
7 and 21, formalizing the complete expropriation of our assets. A jurisdictional hearing before
the ICSID was held in January 2010, with the outcome still pending. For additional information,
see the  Expropriated Assets  section of Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

E P ASIA PACIFIC/MIDDLE EAST

In 2009, E P operations in the Asia Pacific/Middle East Region contributed 13 percent of E P s
worldwide liquids production and 16 percent of natural gas production, compared with 11 percent and
13 percent in 2008, respectively.

Australia and Timor Sea 

Australia Pacific LNG  

In October 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy
company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. The 50/50 joint
venture, named Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG), is focused on CBM production from the Bowen and Surat
Basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. With this transaction, we
gained access to CBM resources in Australia and will enhance our LNG position with the expected
creation of an additional LNG hub targeting Asia Pacific markets. Multiple LNG trains are
anticipated. Over 20,000 gross wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas
market and the LNG development. Drilling and production operations will be supported by gas
gathering systems and centralized gas processing and compression stations, as well as water
treatment facilities.

Our share of the joint venture s production in 2009 was 84 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.
Current
production is sold into the Australian domestic market. CBM field development work is ongoing in
parallel with front-end engineering associated with the planned LNG processing facilities. During
2009, Laird Point was selected as the future site for LNG facilities. Final investment decision on
the initial LNG trains is planned for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Bayu-Undan  

We operate and hold a 57.2 percent ownership interest in the Bayu-Undan Field located in the Timor
Sea. The field averaged a net production rate of 35,000 barrels of liquids per day in 2009,

customers in Japan, compared with 159 billion in 2008.

Greater Sunrise  

We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor
Sea. Although agreement has been reached between the governments of Australia and Timor-Leste
concerning sharing of revenues from the anticipated development of Greater Sunrise, key challenges
to be resolved before significant funding commitments can be made include gaining co-venturer and
government alignment on the development concept, and establishing fiscal stability arrangements.

Western Australia  

 In 2009, our share of production from the Athena/Perseus (WA-17-L) gas field, located offshore
Western Australia, was 35 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, the same as in 2008.

Exploration  

During 2009, we drilled two exploration wells and started a third in the offshore Browse Basin.
The first well, Poseidon-1, was a significant discovery. Poseidon-2, the initial appraisal well
for the discovery, encountered hydrocarbons in some of the same sands as were seen in the discovery
well and is currently being evaluated. A seismic survey has recently been acquired over the
discovery. Additionally, Kontiki-1 was drilled on a prospect independent from Poseidon and was
expensed as a dry hole. We intend to drill at least one additional well in the Browse Basin in 2010.

Qatar 

Qatargas 3 is an integrated project jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent), ConocoPhillips
(30 percent) and Mitsui   Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). The project comprises upstream natural gas
production facilities to produce approximately 1.4 billion gross cubic feet per day of natural gas
from Qatar s North Field. The project also includes a 7.8 million-gross-ton-per-year LNG facility,
from which LNG will be shipped in new, leased LNG carriers destined for sale in the United States
and other markets. The first LNG cargoes are expected to be loaded in the second half of 2010.

In order to capture cost savings, Qatargas 3 is executing the development of the onshore and
offshore assets as a single integrated project with Qatargas 4, a joint venture between Qatar
Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell plc. This includes the joint development of offshore facilities
situated in a common offshore block in the North Field, as well as the construction of two
identical LNG process trains and associated gas treating facilities for both the Qatargas 3 and
Qatargas 4 joint ventures. Upon completion of the Qatargas 3 and Qatargas 4 Projects, production
from the LNG plant and associated facilities will be combined and shared.

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden

MIDSTREAM  

At December 31, 2009, our Midstream segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips  total assets.
Our Midstream business is primarily conducted through our 50 percent equity investment in DCP
Midstream, LLC, a joint venture with Spectra Energy.

The Midstream business purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through
extensive pipeline gathering systems. The gathered natural gas is then processed to extract
natural gas liquids. The remaining  residue  gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial
users and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into
individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or
blendstock. Total natural gas liquids extracted in 2009, including our share of DCP Midstream,
were 187,000 barrels per day, compared with 188,000 in 2008.

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to ConocoPhillips and Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company LLC under a supply agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. Beginning in
2015, the volume commitment is reduced by 20 percent each year until the volume commitment is zero.
This purchase commitment is on an  if-produced, will-purchase  basis and is expected to have a
relatively stable purchase pattern over the remaining term of the contract. Under the agreement,
natural gas liquids are purchased at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees.

DCP Midstream is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2009, DCP Midstream owned or
operated 53 natural gas liquids extraction and 10 natural gas liquids fractionation plants, and its
gathering and transmission systems included approximately 60,000 miles of pipeline. In 2009, DCP
Midstream s raw natural gas throughput averaged 6.1 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas
liquids extraction averaged 358,000 barrels per day, compared with 6.2 billion cubic feet per day
and 360,000 barrels per day in 2008. DCP Midstream s assets are primarily located in the following

MSLP  

Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) is a limited partnership that owns a 70,000 barrel-per-day delayed coker
and related facilities at the Sweeny Refinery used to produce fuel-grade petroleum coke. Prior to
August 28, 2009, MSLP was owned 50/50 by us and PDVSA. Under the agreements that govern the
relationships between the partners, certain defaults by PDVSA with respect to supply of crude oil
to the Sweeny Refinery gave us the right to acquire PDVSA s 50 percent ownership interest in MSLP.
On August 28, 2009, we exercised that right. In public statements, PDVSA has challenged our
actions. We continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in MSLP.

WRB  

In 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation (now Cenovus) to create an
integrated North American heavy oil business. This venture consists of two 50/50 business
ventures: a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Partnership, and a U.S. downstream limited
liability company, WRB Refining LLC. WRB consists of the Wood River and Borger Refineries, located
in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. We are the operator and managing partner of
WRB. See the  Exploration and Production (E P)  section for additional information on FCCL.

Since formation, the joint venture has expanded the processing capability of heavy Canadian crude
to 95,000 barrels per day from 60,000 barrels per day with the startup of a coker at Borger in
2007. In addition, during 2008, the final permit was received and plans were progressed to expand
the Wood River Refinery, including the installation of a coker. With the completion of this
project, anticipated in 2011, total processing capability of heavy Canadian or similar crudes at
Wood River will increase to 225,000 barrels per day, and the majority of the existing asphalt
production at the refinery will be replaced with production of upgraded products.

Capital Projects  

In 2009, capital was directed toward projects to meet environmental and air emission standards and
to further improve the operating reliability, safety and energy efficiency of processing units.
During 2009, we expanded a hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. The
hydrocracker was commissioned in September 2009, resulting in a 12 percent increase in clean
product yield.

Marketing 

In the United States as of December 31, 2009, we marketed gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel
through approximately 8,500 outlets in 49 states. The majority of these sites utilize the  Phillips
66 ,  Conoco  or  76  brands.

Wholesale  

At December 31, 2009, our wholesale operations utilized a network of marketers operating
approximately 7,680 outlets that provided refined product offtake from our refineries. A strong
emphasis is placed on the wholesale channel of trade because of its lower capital requirements. We
also buy and sell petroleum products in the spot market. Our refined products are marketed on both
a branded and unbranded basis.

In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel, we produce and market aviation gasoline, which is
used by smaller, piston engine aircraft. At December 31, 2009, aviation gasoline and jet fuel were
sold through independent marketers at approximately 710  Phillips 66 -branded locations in the United
States.

Retail  

At December 31, 2009, CFJ Properties, our 50/50 joint venture with Flying J, owned and operated
approximately 110  Flying J -branded truck travel plazas. Flying J filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in December 2008. In July 2009, Flying J and Pilot Travel Centers LLC (Pilot) announced
a planned merger of their retail businesses, which was approved by the bankruptcy court in January
2010, and is currently under governmental antitrust review. Subject to the closing of the Flying
J/Pilot merger and other customary conditions, we have agreed to sell our interest in CFJ to Pilot.

In December 2006, we announced our U.S. company-owned and company-operated retail outlets and our
U.S. company-owned and dealer-operated retail outlets would be divested to new or existing
wholesale marketers. Of the approximately 830 sites included in the held for sale plans,
approximately 100 dealer-operated sites remain to be sold in 2010.

Transportation 

We distribute refined products to our customers via company-owned and common-carrier pipeline,
barge, railcar and truck.

Pipelines and Terminals  

At December 31, 2009, R M managed approximately 30,000 miles of common-carrier crude oil, raw
natural gas liquids, and petroleum products pipeline systems in the United States, including those
partially owned or operated by affiliates. We also owned or operated 44 finished product
terminals, seven liquefied petroleum gas terminals, five crude oil terminals and one coke exporting
facility.

In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in four Keystone Pipeline entities, to
create a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. In 2008 we exercised an option to reduce our
equity interest through a dilution mechanism, which gradually lowered our ownership interest to
20.01 percent by the third quarter of 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, we sold our remaining
ownership interest in Keystone.

Tankers  

At December 31, 2009, we had 21 double-hulled crude oil tankers under charter, with capacities
ranging in size from 713,000 to 2,100,000 barrels. These tankers are used primarily to transport
feedstocks to certain of our U.S. refineries. In addition, we  utilitized five double-hulled
product tankers to transport our heavy and clean products. The tankers discussed here exclude the
operations of the company s subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., which are discussed in the E P
segment, as well as an owned tanker on lease to a third party for use in the North Sea.

Specialty Businesses 

We manufacture and sell a variety of specialty products including petroleum cokes, lubes (such as
automotive and industrial lubricants), solvents, polypropylene and pipeline flow improvers. Our
lubes are marketed under the  Phillips 66 ,  Conoco ,  76  and  Kendall  brands. We also manufacture and
market high-quality graphite and anode-grade petroleum cokes in the United States and Europe for
use in the global steel and aluminum industries.

The company s 50 percent owned Excel Paralubes joint venture owns a hydrocracked lubricant base oil
manufacturing plant located adjacent to the Lake Charles Refinery. The facility produces
approximately 20,000 barrels per day of high-quality, clear hydrocracked base oils.

We operate a crude oil and products storage complex consisting of 7.5 million barrels of
storage capacity and an offshore mooring buoy, located about 80 miles southwest of the Whitegate
Refinery in Bantry Bay, Ireland.

In November 2009, we announced a delay in the planned upgrade of the Wilhelmshaven Refinery.
During 2010, we expect to complete procurement of long lead items in anticipation of project
commencement in 2012, contingent upon market conditions.

The project to expand the crude oil, conversion and treating unit capacity of the Melaka Refinery
is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2010. When complete, our net share of the
refinery s crude throughput capacity will increase from 61,000 to 80,000 barrels per day.

In 2006, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Saudi Aramco to conduct a detailed evaluation
of the proposed development of a 400,000 barrel-per-day, full-conversion refinery in Yanbu, Saudi
Arabia. The refinery would be designed to process Arabian heavy crude oil and produce
high-quality, ultra-low-sulfur refined products. Final investment decision on this project is
estimated to occur in 2010.

Marketing 

At December 31, 2009, R M had marketing operations in five European countries. Our European
marketing strategy is to sell primarily through owned, leased or joint venture retail sites using a
low-cost, high-volume strategy. We use the  JET  brand name to market retail and wholesale products
in Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, a joint venture in which we have an
equity interest markets products in Switzerland under the  Coop  brand name. We also market aviation
fuels, liquid petroleum gases, heating oils, transportation fuels and marine bunkers to commercial
customers and into the bulk or spot market in the aforementioned countries and Ireland.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 1,225 marketing outlets in our European operations,
of which approximately 880 were company-owned and 345 were dealer-owned. Through our joint venture
operations in Switzerland, we also have interests in 225 additional sites.

LUKOIL INVESTMENT  

At December 31, 2009, our LUKOIL Investment segment represented 4 percent of ConocoPhillips  total
assets. In 2004, we became a strategic equity investor in OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated
oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Under the Shareholder Agreement between the two
companies, we have representation on the LUKOIL Board of Directors, and LUKOIL s corporate charter
requires unanimous Board consent for certain key decisions. At year-end 2009, we had a 20 percent
ownership interest in LUKOIL based on authorized and issued shares. Based on estimated shares
outstanding at year end, our ownership was 20.09 percent. We use the equity method of accounting
for our investment in LUKOIL. See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

As reported in LUKOIL s publicly available 2008 annual report, the majority of its 2008 upstream
oil production was sourced within Russia, with 59 percent from the western Siberia Region, 18
percent from the Timan-Pechora Province and 12 percent from the Urals Region. Outside of Russia,
LUKOIL had 2008 oil production in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Egypt and Azerbaijan, and gas production
in Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Seventy-five percent of LUKOIL s natural gas production
was sourced within Russia. In addition, LUKOIL has an active exploration program primarily focused
in Russia, with additional activity in several countries. Downstream, LUKOIL has seven refineries,
as well as a 49 percent interest in the ISAB refinery complex in Italy, resulting in total net
crude oil throughput capacity of approximately 1.3 million barrels per day. In 2009, LUKOIL
acquired a 45 percent interest in a Dutch refinery. LUKOIL also has a marketing network extending
to 25 countries, with the majority of wholesale and retail sales in Russia, the United States and
Europe.

CHEMICALS  

At December 31, 2009, our Chemicals segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips  total assets.
The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical
Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with Chevron Corporation, headquartered in The Woodlands,
Texas.

CPChem s business is structured around two primary operating segments: Olefins   Polyolefins and
Specialties, Aromatics   Styrenics. The Olefins   Polyolefins segment produces and markets
ethylene, propylene, and other olefin products, which are primarily consumed within CPChem for the
production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins, polypropylene and polyethylene pipe. The
Specialties, Aromatics   Styrenics segment manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as
benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane. This segment also manufactures and markets
polystyrene, as well as styrene-butadiene copolymers. Furthermore, this segment manufactures and
markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents,
catalysts, drilling chemicals, mining chemicals and high-performance engineering plastics and
compounds.

CPChem s manufacturing facilities are located in Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States.

CPChem owns a 49 percent interest in Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), a joint venture that
owns a major olefins and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar. CPChem also owns a 49 percent
interest in Qatar Chemical Company II Ltd. (Q-Chem II), a joint venture that began construction of
a second complex in Mesaieed in 2005. This Q-Chem II facility is designed to produce polyethylene
and normal alpha olefins on a site adjacent to the Q-Chem complex. In connection with this
project, CPChem entered into a separate agreement establishing a joint venture to develop an
ethylene cracker in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. Operational startup of the Q-Chem II
project is anticipated in the second half of 2010.

In 2008, Jubail Chevron Phillips Company, a 50 percent owned joint venture of CPChem, commenced
startup of an integrated styrene facility in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The facility was built
adjacent to the existing aromatics complex owned by Saudi Chevron Phillips Company (SCP), another
50 percent owned CPChem joint venture. Project completion was achieved in July 2009.

In 2007, CPChem formed a 50 percent owned joint venture, Saudi Polymers Company (SPCo), to
construct and operate an integrated petrochemicals complex at Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia.
Construction began in January 2008, and commercial production is scheduled to begin in late 2011.
In July 2009, an initial public offering of shares in CPChem s joint venture partner s company was
completed, resulting in a corresponding increase in the partner s ownership interest in SPCo, which
reduced CPChem s ownership to 35 percent.

EMERGING BUSINESSES  

At December 31, 2009, our Emerging Businesses segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips 
total assets. The segment encompasses the development of new technologies and businesses outside
our normal operations. Activities within this segment are focused on power generation and new
technologies related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy
oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment.

The focus of our power business is on developing projects to support our E P and R M strategies.
While projects primarily in place to enable these strategies are included within their respective
segments, projects with a significant merchant component are included in the Emerging Businesses
segment.

The Immingham combined heat and power plant (CHP), a wholly owned 730-megawatt facility in the
United Kingdom, provides steam and electricity to the Humber Refinery and steam to a neighboring
refinery, as well as merchant power into the U.K. market. In December 2009, commercial operation
began on a 450-megawatt expansion, bringing total capacity to 1,180 megawatts.

21 

Table of Contents   

We also own a gas-fired cogeneration plant in Orange, Texas, as well as a 50 percent operating
interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP, a joint venture near the Sweeny Refinery complex.

Our Technology group focuses on developing new business opportunities designed to provide future
growth prospects for ConocoPhillips. Focus areas include advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy
efficiency technologies, new petroleum-based products, renewable fuels and carbon capture and
conversion technologies. We have commercialized production of renewable diesel, a new type of
renewable fuel that utilizes existing infrastructure. Relationships with Iowa State University,
Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, and Archer Daniels Midland to develop
second-generation biofuels have also been initiated. In addition, we have formed an internal group
to evaluate wind, solar and geothermal investment opportunities.

Our technology center in Qatar, which we developed with General Electric Company to research water
sustainability solutions for petroleum, petrochemical, municipal and agricultural applications,
opened in 2009.

We offer a gasification technology (E-Gas ) that uses petroleum coke, coal, and other low-value
hydrocarbons as feedstock, resulting in high-value synthesis gas used for a slate of products,
including power, substitute natural gas (SNG), hydrogen and chemicals. This clean, efficient
technology facilitates carbon capture and storage as well as minimizes criteria pollutant emissions
and reduces water consumption. E-Gas  Technology has been utilized in commercial applications
since 1987 and is currently licensed to several third parties. We are currently pursuing three
projects that apply the E-Gas  Technology, two in the United States and one in the United Kingdom.
We are also pursuing several additional licensing opportunities, primarily in Asia and North
America.

COMPETITION 

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the petroleum and
chemicals businesses. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our
segments is highly competitive. No single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominates any
of our business lines.

Upstream, our E P segment competes with numerous other companies in the industry, including
state-owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil and natural
gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on publicly available year-end 2008 reserves
statistics, we had the seventh-largest total of worldwide proved reserves of
nongovernment-controlled companies. We deliver our oil and natural gas production into the
worldwide oil and natural gas commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include
geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic
analysis in connection with portfolio management; and operating efficient oil and gas producing
properties.

The Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DCP Midstream and our consolidated
operations, competes with numerous other integrated petroleum companies, as well as natural gas
transmission and distribution companies, to deliver components of natural gas to end users in the
commodity natural gas markets. DCP Midstream is a large producer of natural gas liquids in the
United States. Principal methods of competing include economically securing the right to purchase
raw natural gas into gathering systems, managing the pressure of those systems, operating efficient
natural gas liquids processing plants and securing markets for the products produced.

Downstream, our R M segment competes primarily in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific
Region. Based on the statistics published in the December 21, 2009, issue of the  Oil   Gas
Journal , our R M segment had the largest U.S. refining capacity of 17 large refiners of petroleum
products. Worldwide, our refining capacity ranked fourth among nongovernment-controlled companies.
In the Chemicals segment, CPChem generally ranked within the top 10 producers of many of its major
product lines, based on average 2009 production capacity, as published by industry sources.
Petroleum products, petrochemicals and plastics are delivered into the worldwide commodity markets.
Elements of competition for both our R M and Chemicals segments include product improvement, new
product development, low-cost structures, and efficient manufacturing and distribution systems. In
the marketing portion of the business, competitive factors include product properties and
processibility, reliability of supply, customer service, price and credit terms, advertising and
sales promotion, and development of customer loyalty to ConocoPhillips  or CPChem s branded
products.

GENERAL 

At the end of 2009, we held a total of 1,435 active patents in 72 countries worldwide, including
565 active U.S. patents. During 2009, we received 30 patents in the United States and 59 foreign
patents. Our products and processes generated licensing revenues of $14 million in 2009. The
overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark,
license, franchise or concession.

Company-sponsored research and development activities charged against earnings were $190 million,
$209 million, and $160 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization provides tools and support to our business
units and staff groups to help them ensure consistent health, safety and environmental excellence.
In support of the goal of zero incidents, we have implemented an HSE Excellence process, which
enables business units to measure their performance and compliance with our HSE Management System

Table of Contents   

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our
business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an
investment in our common stock.

Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed
to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining margins.  

Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we
receive for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products. The factors
influencing the prices of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products are
beyond our control. Lower crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products prices
may reduce the amount of these commodities we can produce economically, which may have a material
adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows.

Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas
production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.  

The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are
depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities,
or, through engineering studies, identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved
reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil and natural gas. Accordingly, to the
extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas we produce with good
prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of
operations.

Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil and
natural gas reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.  

Our proved crude oil and natural gas reserve information included in this annual report has been
derived from engineering estimates prepared or reviewed by our personnel. Any significant future
price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves.
Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental
regulation. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from
underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. As a
result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering
practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash
flows based on the same available data. Any changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our
estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves
reported.

We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of
our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Likewise, future
environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand
for our products.  

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and
affect our operations with respect to, among other things:

The discharge of pollutants into the environment. 

Emissions into the atmosphere (such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury
emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions as they are, or may become, regulated). 

The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and clean up of hazardous materials
and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. 

The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the
end of their useful lives. 

24 

Table of Contents   

We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and
remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these
expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and
services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods
could be materially adversely affected.

In addition, our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic
conditions. To the extent there are significant changes in the Earth s climate, such as more
severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside,
we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our
products could fall.

Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and
materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.  

Actions of the U.S., state and local governments through tax and other legislation, executive order
and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and
abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries.
These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate
in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and
host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of
our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and may continue to do so in the future.

Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect
on us. Approximately 67 percent of our hydrocarbon production in 2009 was derived from production
outside the United States, and 64 percent of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2009, were
located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in
international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil,
natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic
or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations.

Changes in governmental regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of
crude oil and natural gas.  

Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory
agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow
of crude oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies
of crude oil and natural gas. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to
interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.

Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.  

We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our
joint venture participants. There is a risk that our joint venture participants may at any time
have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint
venture or us, or that our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other
obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity
in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any
acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.

Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.  

The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks that must
be managed through continual oversight and control. These risks are present throughout the process
of extraction, transportation, refinement and storage of the hydrocarbons we produce. Failure to
manage these risks could result in injury or loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues
and damage to our reputation.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving
governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials
into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters
that arose during the fourth quarter of 2009, as well as matters previously reported in our 2008
Form 10-K and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2009 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to
the fourth quarter of 2009. Material developments to the previously reported matters have been
included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final
outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings was decided adversely
to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial
position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission s (SEC) regulations.

Our U.S. refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees, regarding alleged violations of
the Federal Clean Air Act, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), six states and one
local air pollution agency. Some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees
provide for stipulated penalties for violations. Stipulated penalties under the decrees are not
automatic, but must be requested by one of the agency signatories. As part of periodic reports
under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations, we occasionally report
matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties. If a specific request for
stipulated penalties meeting the reporting threshold set forth in SEC rules is made pursuant to
these decrees based on a given reported exceedance, we will separately report that matter and the
amount of the proposed penalty.

New Matters   
In May 2008, the EPA issued a Compliance Order to ConocoPhillips alleging our Argenta and Sunnyside
Compressor Station facilities in Colorado violated provisions of the Clean Air Act and failed to
comply with several permit conditions. On February 5, 2010, we settled this matter for a
payment of $175,000 and agreement to install certain emission control equipment.

In 2009, ConocoPhillips notified the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that it had
self-identified certain compliance issues related to Benzene Waste Operations National Emission
Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants requirements at its Trainer, Pennsylvania, and Borger, Texas,
facilities. On January 6, 2010, the DOJ provided its initial penalty demand for this matter as
part of our confidential settlement negotiations. We continue to work with the DOJ to resolve this
matter.

On December 17, 2009, the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board s enforcement staff
(SFRWQCB) issued an Administrative Civil Liability Complaint alleging 18 exceedances of the Rodeo
facility s stormwater permit that occurred during 2008 and 2009. The Complaint seeks a penalty of
$490,000. We are working with the SFRWQCB to resolve this matter.

On January 22, 2010, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) issued a settlement
demand to resolve 16 Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued in 2008 and 2009 that allege violations of
air pollution control regulations and/or facility permit conditions at the Rodeo facility. The
amount of the settlement demand is $179,000. We are working with BAAQMD to resolve this matter.

Matters Previously Reported    
ConocoPhillips Pipe Line Company (CPPL) received a Notice of Probable Violation and Proposed
Civil Penalty (NOPV) from the U.S. Department of Transportation s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (DOT) dated March 30, 2009. The NOPV alleges that CPPL violated certain
operation and

26 

Table of Contents   

safety regulations regarding the control room response to a release on January 8, 2008, near
Denver City, Texas. DOT s proposed penalty for the alleged violation is $200,000. We are working
with DOT to resolve this matter.

On October 23, 2008, ConocoPhillips received a demand from the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board (LARWQCB) to settle multiple alleged exceedances of National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit effluent limits at its Los Angeles lubricants plant dating back to 2000.
We paid a negotiated settlement of $150,000 to the LARWQCB on January 25, 2010, to resolve this
matter.

In October 2003, the District Attorney s Office in Sacramento, California, filed a complaint in
Superior Court for alleged methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) contamination in groundwater. On
April 4, 2008, the District Attorney s Office filed an amended complaint that included alleged
violations of state regulations relating to operation or maintenance of underground storage tanks.
There are numerous defendants named in the suit in addition to ConocoPhillips. We intend to
continue to contest this lawsuit.

In October 2007, we received a Complaint from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Water Act
related to a 2006 oil spill at our Bayway Refinery and proposing a penalty of $156,000. We are
working with the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to resolve this matter.

In March 2005, CPPL received an NOPV from DOT alleging violation of DOT operation and safety
regulations at certain facilities in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wyoming and Nebraska.
DOT is proposing penalties in the amount of $184,500. An information hearing was held on September
24, 2007. CPPL has provided additional information in support of its position. We are currently
awaiting a ruling from DOT.

In 2006, Polar Tankers, Inc. and ConocoPhillips resolved and agreed to pay, with no admission of
liability, civil penalties and response costs associated with a 2004 oil spill in Puget Sound. We
remain in negotiations with the natural resource trustees regarding the natural resource damage
assessment to better the environment.

In April 2004, in response to several historical spills at the Albuquerque Products Terminal, we
received an Administrative Compliance Order from the New Mexico Environment Department. The order
does not propose a penalty assessment, but rather attempts to impose specific design, construction
and operational changes. ConocoPhillips transferred its interest in the terminal, and the current
owner has ceased operations. The spills have been remediated in compliance with New Mexico
Environmental Department standards. ConocoPhillips has withdrawn its settlement offer and
requested that this Order be dismissed.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated
energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 30,000
employees worldwide, and at year-end 2009 had assets of $153 billion. Our stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  COP. 

Our business is organized into six operating segments:

Exploration and Production (E P)  This segment primarily explores for, produces,
transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a
worldwide basis. 

Midstream  This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by
ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly
in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50
percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. 

Refining and Marketing (R M)  This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. 

LUKOIL Investment  This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares
of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia.
At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and
20.09 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. 

Chemicals  This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). 

Emerging Businesses  This segment represents our investment in new technologies or
businesses outside our normal scope of operations.

Table of Contents   

The business environment for the energy industry in 2009 continued to experience volatility
associated with the supply/demand factors that drive its commodity prices and margins. During
2008, forecasts of worldwide economic growth and increasingly scarce supply, a weakening U.S.
dollar, and other factors helped drive crude oil prices to record highs by mid-year, with the
benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) peaking at almost $150 per barrel. This was followed by an
abrupt shift into a severe global financial recession, which drove crude oil prices to the
low-$30-per-barrel range by the end of 2008. As the global economy began to recover, oil prices
steadily improved during 2009 and have remained fairly strong due to demand in Asia. The recovery
from the recession in the United States, however, has been slower and has impacted demand for U.S.
natural gas and refined products.

In response to this challenging business environment, ConocoPhillips announced several strategic
initiatives in late 2009 designed to improve its financial position and increase returns on
capital. This will be accomplished primarily through a combination of enhanced capital discipline
and asset portfolio rationalization, consistent with our objectives of creating shareholder value
and improving financial flexibility, while pursuing long-term strategic projects. Our total
capital program in 2010 is expected to be $11.2 billion, down from a budgeted $12.5 billion in
2009. To improve our financial position and strengthen the balance sheet, we intend to raise
approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. Proceeds will be
targeted to debt reduction, accelerating the return to our targeted debt-to-capital ratio of 20
percent to 25 percent. After these initiatives, we intend to continue to replace reserves and
increase production from a reduced, but more strategic, asset base.

Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in
our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. As noted above,
these prices and margins are subject to extreme volatility. However, from a competitive
perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including:

Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely,
consistently and in an environmentally sound manner.  Safety is our first priority, and
we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our
operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our
refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value
available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2009, our worldwide
refining capacity utilization rate was 84 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2008. The
lower rate primarily reflects reduced throughput at our U.S. and German refineries due to
economic conditions, as well as higher planned downtime, efficiently utilizing periods of
lower margins for maintenance. Although certain North America production was shut-in
during part of 2009 due to the natural gas pricing environment, we increased total
production on a barrel-of-oil-equivalent basis in 2009 by 2 percent. Finally, we strive to
conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship
principles. 

Adding to our proved reserve base.  We primarily add to our proved reserve base
in three ways: 

o 
       
     Successful exploration and development of new fields. 

o 
       
     Acquisition of existing fields. 

o 
       
     Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. 

Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in
maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being
able to do so in the future. In the five years ending December 31, 2009, our reserve
replacement was 145 percent. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and
project developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela
and Ecuador.

Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is
prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make
projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from
national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or
other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our
reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.

33 

Table of Contents   

Controlling costs and expenses.  Since we cannot control the prices of the
commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of
our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor
these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on
both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead
costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a
component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs were reduced
13 percent in 2009, compared with 2008, reflecting both market conditions and our continued
emphasis on cost control throughout the year. 

Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars.  We
participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant
capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields,
maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We
invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested
dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to
the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. 

The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $10.9
billion in 2009, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately
$10.5 billion in 2010. The 2010 budget is consistent with our recently announced plan to
improve returns through increased capital discipline, while still funding existing projects
and enabling us to preserve flexibility to develop major projects in the future. In
addition to our capital program, we paid dividends on our common stock of $2.8 billion in
2009. 

Managing our asset portfolio.  We continually evaluate our assets to determine
whether they no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed.
In 2008, we sold our retail marketing assets in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, in addition to
our E P properties in Argentina and the Netherlands. In 2009, we sold a majority of our
U.S. retail marketing assets. Also in 2009, we announced our intention to raise
approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. 

Developing and retaining a talented work force.  We strive to attract, train,
develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business
strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the
continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new
hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical
and functional skills. 

Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the
operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas liquids prices,
natural gas prices, production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output.

34 

Table of Contents   

Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:

Impairments.  As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive
industries. At times, our investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are
revised downward, when crude oil prices, natural gas prices or refining margins decline
significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to
a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in
exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a
material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2009 totaled $0.8
billion and primarily related to certain natural gas properties in western Canada and our
equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG). Before-tax impairments in 2008, excluding
the goodwill impairment discussed below and a $7.4 billion impairment related to our LUKOIL
investment, totaled $1.7 billion. 

Goodwill.  At year-end 2009 and 2008, we had $3.6
billion and $3.8 billion, respectively,
of goodwill on our balance sheet, compared with $29.3 billion at year-end 2007. In 2008,
we recorded a $25.4 billion complete impairment of our E P segment goodwill, primarily as a
function of decreased year-end commodity prices and the decline in our market
capitalization. For additional information, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deterioration of market conditions in the
future could lead to other goodwill impairments that may have a substantial negative,
though noncash, effect on our profitability. 

Effective tax rate.  Our operations are located in countries with different tax
rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and
fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly
between periods based on the  mix  of pretax earnings within our global operations.  

Fiscal and regulatory environment.  As commodity prices and refining
margins fluctuated upward over the last several years, certain governments responded with
changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results
of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact
on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we
recorded a $4.5 billion after-tax impairment. In the second quarter of 2009, our assets in
Ecuador were effectively expropriated, and we recorded a $51 million before- and after-tax
impairment (see the  Expropriated Assets  section of Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). We were also negatively impacted by increased
production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007. In Canada,
the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective
January 1, 2009, so that a component of the new royalty rate is tied to prevailing prices.
In October 2008, we and our co-venturers signed definitive agreements for the proportional
dilution of our equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstan s North Caspian Sea
Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan Field, to allow the state-owned
energy company to increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008. Partially
offsetting the above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by
Canada and Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and
were not exclusive to the oil and gas industry.

Segment Analysis  

The E P segment s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are
commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over
which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate were lower in
2009, compared with 2008, averaging $61.69 per barrel in 2009, a decrease of 38 percent. Crude oil
prices steadily trended upward during 2009, as global crude inventories were reduced due to lower
production and economic recovery that stimulated the resumption of global oil demand growth.
Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub decreased 56 percent during 2009 to an average price of
$3.99 per million British thermal units, primarily as a result of lower demand due to the U.S.
recession and higher domestic production due to increased shale gas production.

The Midstream segment s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most
important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent
equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream s natural gas liquids prices decreased 43
percent in 2009.

Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control and marketing margins primarily drive the R M
segment s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other
feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors
over which we have no control. Global refining margins remained weak in 2009. The U.S. benchmark
3:2:1 crack spread decreased almost 20 percent in 2009, while the N.W. Europe benchmark declined 54
percent. Demand, particularly for distillates, continued to be suppressed by the global economic
slowdown. In addition, the compressed differential in prices for high-quality crude oil, compared
with those of lower-quality crude oil, reduced margins for those refineries configured to
capitalize on the ability to process lower-quality crudes.

The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At
December 31, 2009, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.09
percent based on estimated shares outstanding. LUKOIL s results are subject to factors similar to
those of our E P and R M segments. LUKOIL s upstream results are closely linked to Russian (Urals)
crude oil prices and are heavily impacted by extraction tax rates. Refining margins are
significant factors on LUKOIL s downstream results. Export tariff rates for crude oil and refined
products also have a significant impact on both upstream and downstream results.

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics
industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on
market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in
feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia.

The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside
our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power
generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and
nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels
and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of
profitability in future years.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Consolidated Results 

A summary of the company s net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment
follows:

2009 vs. 2008 

The improved results in 2009 were primarily the result of:

Lower production taxes. 

Reduced operating and overhead expenses. 

These items were partially offset by:

Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which impacted our E P,
Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. 

Lower refining margins in our R M segment. 

2008 vs. 2007 

The lower results in 2008 were primarily the result of:

The goodwill and LUKOIL impairments, noted above. 

Lower U.S. refining margins in our R M segment. 

An increase in other asset impairments, predominantly in our E P and R M segments. 

These items were partially offset by:

Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which
benefitted our E P, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Commodity price benefits
were somewhat counteracted by increased production taxes. 

A 2007 complete impairment ($4,588 million before-tax, $4,512 million after-tax) of our
oil interests in Venezuela, resulting from their expropriation.

Statement of Operations Analysis 

2009 vs. 2008 

Sales and other operating revenues  decreased 38 percent in 2009, while  purchased crude
oil, natural gas and products  decreased 39 percent. These decreases were mainly the result of
significantly lower prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

Equity in earnings of affiliates  decreased 30 percent in 2009, primarily due to reduced
earnings from DCP Midstream; LUKOIL; Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP); Malaysian Refining Company Sdn.
Bhd.; and Excel Paralubes, which were partially offset by higher earnings from Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company LLC. The decreases were mainly the result of lower commodity prices and refining
margins.

Other income  decreased 52 percent during 2009. The decrease was primarily due to 2008
gains related to asset dispositions in our E P and R M segments.

Production
and operating expenses  decreased 13 percent in 2009, as a result of lower
utilities costs, favorable foreign exchange impacts, and our cost reduction efforts.

Selling, general and administrative expense  decreased 18 percent in 2009, primarily due to
disposition of U.S. and international marketing assets.

Taxes other than income taxes  decreased 25 percent in 2009, primarily due to lower
production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices, as well as reduced excise taxes on
petroleum product sales.

Impairments  decreased from $34,539 million in 2008 to $535 million in 2009, primarily
reflecting the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments. Other impairments decreased $1,202 million
during 2009. For additional information, see Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term
Receivables, Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, and Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest and debt expense  increased 38 percent in 2009, as a result of a higher average
debt level, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense also increased as a result
of lower capitalized interest.

See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information
regarding our  income tax expense  and effective tax rate.

2008 vs. 2007 

Sales and other operating revenues  increased 28 percent in 2008, while  purchased crude
oil, natural gas and products  increased 37 percent. These increases were the result of higher
petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

Table of Contents   

Equity in earnings of affiliates  decreased 16 percent in 2008, reflecting:

Lower results from WRB Refining LLC, due to lower margins and a decline in equity
ownership in accordance with the designed formation of the venture. 

Lower results from CPChem, due to higher operating costs, lower specialties, aromatics
and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. 

The absence of earnings from our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in
2007. 

Increased losses related to our NMNG joint venture as a result of higher production
taxes and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) costs during the
startup and early production phase of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) Field. 

These negative results were somewhat offset by improved results from the FCCL Partnership, DCP
Midstream, LUKOIL (excluding the investment impairment), and CFJ Properties.

Other income  decreased 45 percent during 2008, mainly due to a lower net benefit from asset
rationalization efforts, the release in 2007 of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint
venture in Venezuela, and the settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality
differentials on Trans-Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007.

Exploration expenses  increased 33 percent during 2008, reflecting increased dry hole costs
and higher expenses for post-discovery feasibility and development planning studies.

Impairments  increased from $5,030 million in 2007 to $34,539 million in 2008. This
increase primarily reflects the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments, partially offset by a 2007
impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela.

Interest and debt expense  decreased 25 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average
interest rates, as well as the absence of 2007 interest expense related to the Alaska Quality Bank
settlements.

Foreign currency transaction losses  incurred during 2008 totaled $117 million, compared
with foreign currency transaction gains of $201 million in 2007. This change occurred as the
Canadian dollar, Russian rouble, British pound, and euro all weakened against the U.S. dollar
during 2008, compared with the strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar in 2007.

Equity affiliate statistics exclude our share of
LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. 

The E P segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural
gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2009, our E P
operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,
offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria and
Russia.

Table of Contents   

2009 vs. 2008 

The E P segment had earnings of $3,604 million during 2009. In 2008, the E P segment had a loss of
$13,479 million, which included a $25,443 million before- and after-tax complete impairment of E P
segment goodwill. For additional information, see the  Goodwill Impairment  section of Note
9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Excluding the impact from the goodwill impairment, earnings from the E P segment decreased 70
percent during 2009, primarily due to substantially lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids prices. Our E P segment also recognized property impairment charges. These decreases were
partially offset by lower Alaska and Lower 48 production taxes due to lower prices, as well as
higher international volumes and improved operating costs. See the  Business Environment and
Executive Overview  section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas
prices.

Proved reserves at year-end 2009 were 8.36 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with
8.08 billion at year-end 2008. This excludes the estimated 1,967 million BOE and 1,893 million BOE
included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively. Also excluded
for 2008 is our share of Canadian Syncrude reserves of 249 million barrels.

U.S. E P  

Earnings from our U.S. E P operations decreased 70 percent, due to significantly lower crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Lower production taxes, lower property impairments in
the Lower 48 and improved operating costs partially offset the decrease.

U.S. E P production averaged 755,000 BOE per day in 2009, a decrease of 3 percent from 775,000 in
2008. Less unplanned downtime and improved well performance were more than offset by field
decline.

International E P  

Earnings from our international E P operations were $2,101 million in 2009, compared with $6,976
million in 2008. The decline was primarily a result of significantly lower crude oil, natural gas
and natural gas liquids prices and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by
higher volumes and lower operating costs.

International E P production averaged 1,099,000 BOE per day in 2009, an increase of 8 percent from
1,014,000 in 2008. The increase was predominantly due to new production in the United Kingdom,
Russia, China, Canada, Norway and Vietnam. In addition, production increased due to the impacts
from the royalty framework in Alberta, Canada, as well as less unplanned downtime and the impact of
lower prices on production sharing arrangements. These increases were partially offset by field
decline and more planned downtime.

2008 vs. 2007 

The E P segment recorded a loss of $13,479 million during 2008. This amount included a $25,443
million before- and after-tax complete impairment of E P segment goodwill. In 2007, the E P
segment had earnings of $4,615 million, which included the impact of a $4,588 million before-tax
impairment ($4,512 million after-tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in
Venezuela. For additional information, see the  Goodwill Impairment  section of Note 9 Goodwill
and Intangibles, and the  Expropriated Assets  section of Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.

42 

Table of Contents   

The decrease in earnings resulted from the goodwill impairment, higher taxes other than income
(mainly in Alaska), lower production volumes, higher operating and exploration costs, increased
property impairments and depreciation expense, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release
of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. The decrease was
partially offset by the absence of the 2007 Venezuela impairment, as well as higher crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. During 2008, our E P segment recognized property
impairment charges totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to revised capital spending plans as
a result of current project economics, as well as a significantly diminished outlook for commodity
prices. A large portion of these impairments relate to fields in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada.

U.S. E P  

Earnings from our U.S. E P operations increased 17 percent, primarily due to higher crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production
taxes (mainly in Alaska), lower volumes, an increase in impairments of properties in the Lower 48,
and higher operating costs.

E P production on a BOE basis averaged 775,000 per day in 2008, a decrease of 8 percent from
843,000 in 2007. The production decrease was primarily attributable to field decline and unplanned
downtime in the Lower 48 due to hurricane disruptions.

International E P  

Earnings from our international E P operations increased from $367 million in 2007 to $6,976
million in 2008. The increase was attributed to the impact of the Venezuelan impairment on our
prior-year results and higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase
was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased rates and new assets being
placed in service, increased taxes other than income, higher operating costs, and the absence of a
2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in
Venezuela.

International E P production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2008, a decrease of 2 percent from
1,037,000 in 2007. Decreases in production were caused by field decline and the expropriation of
our Venezuelan oil interests. These decreases were mostly offset by increased production from new
developments in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, Norway and Canada.

Table of Contents   

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas
through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to
extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining  residue  gas is marketed to
electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas
liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and
marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50
percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and
processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in
the United States and Trinidad.

2009 vs. 2008 

Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased 42 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due
to substantially lower realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by the recognition of
an $88 million after-tax benefit in the first quarter of 2009 resulting from a DCP Midstream
subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units.

2008 vs. 2007 

Earnings from the Midstream segment increased 19 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due
to higher realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and
higher depreciation expense.

year-end 2007 was 2,037,000 barrels per day for our domestic refineries and 669,000 barrels per
day for our international refineries.  

The R M segment s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into
petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and
transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products.
R M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region.

45 

Table of Contents   

2009 vs. 2008 

R M reported earnings of $37 million in 2009, compared with $2,322 million in 2008. The decrease
was primarily a result of significantly lower U.S. and international refining margins, lower
volumes, lower international marketing margins and a lower net benefit from asset rationalization
efforts. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower property
impairments and positive foreign currency exchange impacts. During 2008, our R M segment had
property impairments totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished
outlook for refining margins.

During 2009, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 84 percent, compared with 90
percent in 2008.

U.S. R M  

Our U.S. R M operations reported a loss of $192 million in 2009, compared with earnings of $1,540
million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower U.S. refining margins,
lower U.S. refining and marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These
decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower property impairments.

Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2009, compared with 92 percent in
2008. The current-year rate was mainly affected by run reductions due to market conditions and
increased turnaround activity, while the prior-year rate was impacted by downtime associated with
hurricanes.

International R M  

International R M reported earnings of $229 million in 2009 and earnings of $782 million in 2008.
The decrease in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower international refining and
marketing margins, lower international marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales.
These decreases were partially offset by positive foreign currency impacts, lower property
impairments and lower operating expenses.

Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 74 percent in 2009, compared with 85
percent in 2008. The current-year rate reflects higher turnaround activity. In addition, the
utilization rate for both periods reflects run reductions in response to market conditions.

2008 vs. 2007 

R M earnings decreased 61 percent in 2008. The results were lower due to decreases in U.S.
refining margins and volumes, increased property impairments, higher operating costs, a reduced
benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and lower international marketing and refining volumes
due to asset sales. These R M decreases were partially offset by higher international marketing
margins.

During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94
percent in 2007.

U.S. R M  

Earnings from our U.S. R M operations decreased 67 percent in 2008. Results for 2008 also included
an impairment related to one of our U.S. refineries.

Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2008, compared with 96 percent in
2007. The decline in the 2008  rate resulted mainly from refinery optimization and
unplanned downtime, which included the impact of hurricanes on our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.

International R M  

Earnings from our international R M operations decreased 40 percent in 2008. Contributing to the
decrease was the impairment of a refinery in Europe and the absence of a $141 million 2007 German
tax legislation benefit.

46 

Table of Contents   

Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 85 percent in 2008, compared with 90
percent during the previous year. The utilization rate was primarily impacted by reduced crude
throughput at our Wilhelmshaven Refinery due to economic conditions and planned maintenance.

LUKOIL Investment 

*  
       
      Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL s production and processing.  

This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international,
integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity
method. At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on authorized
and issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity
method accounting, was 20.09 percent at that date.

Because LUKOIL s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and
statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated based on current market indicators, publicly
available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and
estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will be
a recurring component of future-period results. In addition to our estimated equity share of
LUKOIL s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our
equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment. The segment also
includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL.

2009 vs. 2008 

The LUKOIL Investment segment had earnings of $1,663 million during 2009, compared with a loss of
$5,488 million in 2008. Results for 2008 included a $7,410 million noncash, before- and after-tax
impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. For additional information,
see the  LUKOIL  section of Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Excluding the impact of the impairment, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment decreased 13
percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower estimated realized refined product and
crude oil prices, which was mostly offset by lower estimated extraction taxes and export tariff
rates, and a benefit from basis difference amortization.

2008 vs. 2007 

The LUKOIL Investment segment had a $5,488 million loss in 2008, compared with $1,818 million of
earnings in 2007. Excluding the impact of the impairment, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment
segment increased 6 percent in 2008. This increase was primarily due to higher estimated realized
prices of both refined product and crude oil sales. Partially offsetting these positive impacts
were higher estimated extraction taxes and higher estimated crude and refined product export tariff
rates, as well as higher estimated operating costs and lower estimated crude volumes.

47 

Table of Contents   

Chemicals 

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
(CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other
feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as
feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals.

2009 vs. 2008 

Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $138 million in 2009 due to lower operating costs and
higher margins in the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. These increases were
partially offset by lower margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line.

2008 vs. 2007 

Earnings from the Chemicals segment decreased by $249 million in 2008 due to higher utilities and
other operating costs, the absence of 2007 one-time tax benefits, lower margins in the specialties,
aromatics and styrenics business line, and lower volumes from the olefins and polyolefins business
line. Increases in olefins and polyolefins margins somewhat offset these negative effects.

Emerging Businesses 

The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside
our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power
generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and
nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels,
and the environment.

2009 vs. 2008 

Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $3 million in 2009, compared with $30 million in 2008.
The decrease was primarily due to lower international power results and higher technology
development expenses, which were mostly offset by the absence of an $85 million after-tax
impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant in 2008.

2008 vs. 2007 

Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $30 million in 2008, compared with a loss of $8 million in
2007. The increase primarily reflects improved international power generation results, including
the impact of higher spark spreads. These benefits were partially offset by an $85 million
after-tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant, as well as by lower domestic power
results.

Table of Contents   

Corporate and Other 

2009 vs. 2008 

Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized
interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 53
percent in 2009 as a result of higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average
interest rates. Capitalized interest was also lower in 2009. Corporate general and administrative
expenses decreased 47 percent due to decreased costs related to compensation plans and overhead.
The category  Other  includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental
costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an
operating segment. Changes in the  Other  category are primarily due to higher foreign currency
transaction gains.

2008 vs. 2007 

Net interest decreased 32 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average interest rates and a
higher effective tax rate. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 15 percent in
2008, mainly as a result of increased charitable contributions. Acquisition-related costs in 2007
included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition.  Other  expenses
increased in 2008 due to various tax-related adjustments, partially offset by lower foreign
currency losses.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Financial Indicators 

*  
       
      Total debt includes short-term and long-term debt, as shown on our consolidated 
 balance sheet.  

**  
       
      Capital includes total debt and total equity.  

To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding
sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition,
during 2009 $1,229 million of net debt was issued, and we received $1,270 million in proceeds from
asset sales. During 2009, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and
investments program, pay dividends, and meet the funding requirements to FCCL Partnership. Total
dividends paid on our common stock during the year were $2,832 million. During 2009, cash and cash
equivalents decreased by $213 million to $542 million.

In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our
commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our
short- and long-term liquidity requirements. The credit markets, including the commercial paper
markets in the United States, have experienced adverse conditions during 2008 and 2009. Although
we have not been materially impacted by these conditions, continuing volatility in the credit
markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments due
to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks. Such volatility may also affect our
ability, the ability of our joint ventures and equity affiliates, and the ability of third parties
with whom we seek to do business, to access those credit markets. Notwithstanding these adverse
market conditions, we believe current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by
operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the
 Significant Sources of Capital  section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in
the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt
payments and the funding requirements to FCCL.

Significant Sources of Capital 

Operating Activities  

During 2009, cash of $12,479 million was provided by operating activities, a 45 percent decrease
from cash from operations of $22,658 million in 2008. The decline was primarily due to
significantly lower commodity prices in our E P segment and lower refining margins in our R M
segment.

During 2008, cash flow from operations decreased $1,892 million, compared with 2007. Contributing
to the decrease were lower U.S. refining margins and volumetric inventory builds in our R M segment
in 2008, versus reductions in 2007. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity prices
in our E P segment.

While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity
and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short- and long-term operating cash
flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well
as refining and marketing margins. During 2008 and 2007, we benefited from favorable crude oil and
natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Crude oil and natural gas prices generally trended higher during 2009. Refining margins
deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and

50 

Table of Contents   

remained low throughout 2009. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are
driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as
these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash
flows.

The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts
our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and
dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency,
weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely
and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can
cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant
as that caused by commodity prices.

Our production for 2009, including our share of production from equity affiliates, averaged 2.29
million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among
others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project
investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty
contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our
production in 2010, including the impact of anticipated dispositions, is expected to be in the
range of 2.2 million BOE per day, similar to 2008 production levels. We continue to evaluate
various properties as potential candidates for our recently announced disposition program. The
makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2010 and future years  production
levels.

To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base.
Our reserve replacement in 2009 was 141 percent, including 133 percent from consolidated
operations. The

 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
 adopted new reserves reporting rules effective in 2009, which allowed us to
include Syncrude oil sands mining operations in our proved reserves. Excluding the impact of the
addition of Syncrude, we replaced 112 percent of total production in 2009, reflecting progress on
major projects, including the sanctioning of additional phases of in-situ oil sands projects in
Canada, as well as reserve additions from our LUKOIL Investment segment. Over the five-year period
ending December 31, 2009, our reserve replacement was 145 percent, including 120 percent from
consolidated operations. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project
developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador. The
reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved
recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in
our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including
both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the  Oil and Gas Operations  section of this report.

We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base.
However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is
prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects
uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil
companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may
negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which
we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent
years.

As discussed in the  Critical Accounting Estimates  section, engineering estimates of proved
reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to
the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on
reservoirs. In 2009 and 2007, revisions increased reserves, while in 2008 revisions decreased
reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in
the future.

In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The
output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance
turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage
the operations of our refineries, and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been
as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins.

Asset Sales  

Proceeds from asset sales in 2009 were $1,270 million, compared with $1,640 million in 2008. In
2009, we closed on the sale of our ownership interest in the Keystone Pipeline and a large part of
our U.S. retail marketing assets, which included seller financing in the form of a $370 million
five-year note and letters of credit totaling $54 million.

We plan to raise approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. We
will continue to identify the assets and begin marketing efforts over the near term, with
disposition candidates across the company s operations being considered. Proceeds will be
targeted toward debt reduction.

Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities  

At December 31, 2009, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $7.85 billion, consisting of
a $7.35 billion facility expiring in September 2012 and a $500 million facility expiring in July
2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for
issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper
programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and
do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of
specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision
relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or
more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.

Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated
banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime
rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment
fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if
our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of
Directors.

Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion
commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also
have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to
fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 Project. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no
direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had
been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs,
$1,300 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2009, compared with $6,933
million at December 31, 2008. Since we had $1,300 million of commercial paper outstanding and had
issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.5 billion in borrowing capacity under
our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2009.

Shelf Registration  

We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and
sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Under SEC shelf
registrations, in early February 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25
billion of 5.75% Notes due 2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039, and in May 2009, we
issued $1.5 billion of 4.60% Notes due 2015, $1.0 billion of 6.00% Notes due 2020 and an additional
$500 million of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds from these notes were primarily used to reduce
outstanding commercial paper balances and for general corporate purposes.

Our senior long-term debt is rated  A1  by Moody s Investor Service and  A  by both Standard and
Poor s Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate
debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the
event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level
prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds
under our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility and our $500 million credit facility.

Noncontrolling Interests  

At December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had $590 million and $1,100 million, respectively,
of equity in less-than-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest
owners. The decline from year-end 2008 was primarily due to Ashford Energy Capital S.A. redeeming
for $500 million,

52 

Table of Contents   

plus accrued dividends, the investment in Ashford held by Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. in the third
quarter of 2009. The remaining noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2009, primarily represent
operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $565 million, was related
to Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, located in Australia s Northern Territory.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we
enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share
costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2009,
we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements:

Qatargas 3   :  We own a 30 percent interest in Qatargas 3, an integrated project to
produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar s North Field. The other participants in the
project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui   Co., Ltd. (1.5
percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas
Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured
project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from
export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from
ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as
the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all
loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants,
based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this
financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, currently expected in
2011, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will
become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2009, Qatargas 3 had
approximately $3.6 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which
ConocoPhillips provided $1 billion, and an additional $88 million of accrued interest. 

Rockies Express Pipeline   :  In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of
$2 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, operated by Kinder
Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. Rockies Express completed construction of a natural gas
pipeline across a portion of the United States in November 2009. Shortly after completion,
ConocoPhillips increased its ownership from 24 to 25 percent. The maximum potential amount
of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $500
million, which could become payable if the credit facilities are fully utilized and Rockies
Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2009,
Rockies Express had $1,673 million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 25
percent guarantee equaling $418 million. The guarantee expires in April 2011. However,
 it is anticipated
refinancing of all or a portion of the $2 billion credit facility will take place in 2010,
which is expected to reduce our guarantee exposure. 

For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Capital Requirements 

Our debt balance at December 31, 2009, was $28.7 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion during 2009,
and our debt-to-capital ratio was 31 percent at year-end 2009, versus 33 percent at the end of
2008. The change in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to an increase in equity. Our
debt-to-capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent.

During 2009, we used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to redeem $284 million of
6.375% Notes and $950 million of Floating Rate Notes upon their maturity, and prepaid $750 million
of Floating Rate Five-Year Term Notes.

On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana (now Cenovus). As part of this
transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year
period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the
transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly
principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will
continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation

53 

Table of Contents   

amount, approximately $660 million was short-term and was included in the  Accounts payable related
parties  line on our December 31, 2009, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these
payments, which totaled $625 million in 2009, are included in the  Other  line in the financing
activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual
rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest
payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the  Capital expenditures and
investments  line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

We have provided loan financing to WRB Refining LLC, to assist it in meeting its operating and
capital spending requirements. At December 31, 2009, $350 million of such financing was
outstanding and was classified as long term.

In February 2010, we announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. The dividend is payable
March 1, 2010, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 22, 2010.

Contractual Obligations 

The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of
December 31, 2009:

(a) 
       
     Includes $502 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12 Debt, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 

(b) 
       
     Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally
binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for
jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. 

The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and
futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids
(NGL), natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and
fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase
commitments with third parties totaled $58,935 million. In addition, $40,739 million are
product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining term of 90
years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 15 years. 

Purchase obligations of $8,226 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the
capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product
terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. 

54 

Table of Contents   

The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services
for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. 

(c) 
       
     Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a seven-year
period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. 

(d) 
       
     Does not include: Pensions for the 2010 through 2014 time period, we expect to contribute an
average of $540 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement
benefit plans in the United States and an average of $250 million per year to our non-U.S.
plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S.
five-year average consists of $530 million for 2010 and then approximately $540 million per
year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2010 is expected to be
$130 million in the United States and $170 million outside the United States. 

(e) 
       
     Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $1,148 million because the ultimate disposition and
timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount are not reasonably estimable.
Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in
this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. 

Capital Spending 

Capital Expenditures and Investments 

Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ending December 31, 2009,
totaled $41.8 billion, with 85 percent allocated to our E P segment.

Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2010 is $10.5 billion. Included in this amount
is approximately $500 million in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 85 percent of the capital
expenditures and investments budget to E P and 13 percent to R M. With the addition of loans to
certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to funding our portion of the FCCL
business venture, our total capital program for 2010 is approximately $11.2 billion.

55 

Table of Contents

2010 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET

E P s 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget is $8.9 billion, which is essentially the
same as actual expenditures in 2009. Twenty-eight percent of E P s 2010 capital expenditures and
investments budget is planned for the United States.

Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to be directed toward the  Prudhoe Bay
and Kuparuk Fields, as well as the Alpine Field and satellites on the Western North Slope.

In the Lower 48, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments for ongoing development in
the San Juan and Permian Basins and the Bakken and Lobo Trends. Also, we expect to direct capital
spending towards exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford shale
position in Texas.

E P is directing $6.5 billion of its 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget to
international projects. Funds in 2010 will be directed to developing major long-term projects
including:

Canadian oil sands projects and ongoing natural gas projects in the western Canada gas
basins. 

Further development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint
venture in Australia. 

Completion of the Qatargas 3 Project in Qatar.

For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated cost to develop these reserves,
see the  Oil and Gas Operations  section.

R M 

Capital spending for R M during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, was primarily for
clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve
product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating
integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period,
R M capital spending was $5.4 billion, representing 13 percent of our total capital expenditures
and investments.

Key projects during the three-year period included:

Installation of a 20,000 barrel-per-day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San
Francisco Refinery. 

Installation of a 25,000 barrel-per-day coker and new vacuum unit at the Borger
Refinery. 

Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at all U.S. refineries to enable
production of low-sulfur and ultra-low-sulfur fuels. 

Upgrading the distillate desulfurization capability at the Humber Refinery. 

Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new
sulfur plant at the Ferndale Refinery. 

Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone Pipeline entities, and
associated investment to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery
points in the United States. We disposed of our interest in the Keystone Pipeline in 2009. 

Major construction activities in progress include:

Installation of a 65,000 barrel-per-day coker and a major reconfiguration of the Wood
River Refinery to handle advantaged crude and increase capacity, partially funded through
long-term advances from ConocoPhillips. 

U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. 

2010 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET

R M s 2010 capital budget is $1.3 billion, a 24 percent decrease from actual spending in 2009, with
about $0.9 billion for its U.S. downstream businesses and $0.4 billion for international R M.
These funds will be used for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business
with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance and reliability. As previously announced, the
refinery upgrade project at Wilhelmshaven has been delayed.

Emerging Businesses 

Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, was
primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our
Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50 percent
interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP.

Contingencies 

Legal and Tax Matters  

We accrue a liability for known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes) when a
loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be
reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount,
then the minimum of the range is

57 

Table of Contents   

accrued. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted
loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently
available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent
liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Environmental  

We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations as other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining, and crude oil
and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these
environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:

U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. 

U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. 

European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of
Chemicals (REACH). 

U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous
substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to
occur. 

U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment,
storage and disposal of solid waste. 

U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of
onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore
facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and
damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. 

U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires
facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees
and response departments. 

U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in
underground injection wells. 

U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas
operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting
from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. 

European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. 

These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of
discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in
association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect
substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and
time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and
the agency s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting
process are beyond the control of the applicant.

Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar
environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in
some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to
the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international
borders.

The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly
known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality
standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and
regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are
expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in
other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission
compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.

For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a
percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations
were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence   Security Act of 2007, which was signed
in

58 

Table of Contents   

December 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66
percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of
2005, with further increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We have met the
increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies,
along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. Implementing
regulations and standards for 2010 and beyond remain uncertain as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has not promulgated final provisions.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation
obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA
and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility
arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present
ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States.
Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be
assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many
states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and
groundwater.

At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions
warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to
CERCLA, which is often referred to as  Superfund,  the cost of corrective action activities under
RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased
expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the
near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have
experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable
uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.

We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the
EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under
CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost
recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits
assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by
us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2008, we
reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 65
sites around the United States. At December 31, 2009, we resolved and closed two sites, re-opened
one site, and received one notice of potential liability, leaving 65 unresolved sites where we have
been notified of potential liability.

For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site
remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to
all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those
potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for
state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had
the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially
responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA
or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally
assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In
some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs
generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are
relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of
anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all
CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or
financial condition.

Expensed environmental costs were $1,070 million in 2009 and are expected to be about $1.1 billion
per year in 2010 and 2011. Capitalized environmental costs were $891 million in 2009 and are
expected to be about $830 million per year in 2010 and 2011.

We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for
potential recoveries from

59 

Table of Contents   

insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business
combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).

Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to
undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once
conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual
also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which
are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we
accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may
incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect
to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts
accrued as of December 31, 2009.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the
mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies
and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.
Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.

At December 31, 2009, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $1,017
million, compared with $979 million at December 31, 2008. We expect to incur a substantial amount
of these expenditures within the next 30 years.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses,
environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be
no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do
not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a
result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.

Climate Change  

There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws
focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could
apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field
continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for
implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted,
could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of
legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:

European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European
Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. 

California s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources
Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce
California s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. 

Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and
Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or
greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net
emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an
ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. 

The EPA s announcement on December 7, 2009,  Endangerment and Cause or Contribute
Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 74, Fed. Reg.
66,495,  finalizing its findings that GHG emissions threaten public health and the
environment and that cars and light trucks cause or contribute to this threat. While these
findings do not themselves impose any requirements on any industry or company at this time,
these findings may lead to greater regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, may trigger more
climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for
development projects to determine the extent of climate change. 

60 

Table of Contents   

In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed
at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission
has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize
any financial impact from the trading scheme.

In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming
at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several
forms that result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of
output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required
acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational
and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.

Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG
reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived
products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation.
Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources,
including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or
negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:

Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. 

The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). 

The GHG reductions required. 

The price and availability of offsets. 

The amount and allocation of allowances. 

Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. 

Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe
weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). 

Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in
the prices of our products and services. 

Other 

We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit
carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to
an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income,
our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the
net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as
reductions in future taxable income.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 166,  Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 140.  This Statement was codified into FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 860,  Transfers and
Servicing.  This Statement removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (SPE) and
the exception for qualifying SPEs from the consolidation guidance. Additionally, the Statement
clarifies the requirements for financial asset transfers eligible for sale accounting. This
Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Also in June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,  Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),  to
address the effects of the elimination of the qualifying SPE concept in SFAS No. 166, and other
concerns about the application of key provisions of consolidation guidance for variable interest
entities (VIEs). This Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic 810,  Consolidation.  More
specifically, SFAS No. 167 requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach to determine
the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it amends certain guidance pertaining to the determination of the
primary beneficiary when related parties are involved, and it amends certain guidance for
determining whether an entity is a VIE. Additionally, this

61 

Table of Contents   

Statement requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a
VIE. This Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note
1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our
major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and
uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different
amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been
used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of
the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical
accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset
valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of
accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.

Oil and Gas Accounting 

Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to
the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior
to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research
and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are
capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have
been discovered on the prospect.

Property Acquisition Costs  

For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on
exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are
relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the
prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold
information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or
no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally
judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition
cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a
periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.

This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period
of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on
adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At
year-end 2009, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are
relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation,
was $1,466 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $551 million. The weighted-average
judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 62 percent, and the
weighted-average amortization period was approximately 2.5 years. If that judgmental percentage
were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2010
would increase by approximately $32 million. The remaining $5,040 million of gross capitalized
unproved property costs at year-end 2009 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral
rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended
exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for
impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project
commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.6 billion is concentrated in 10 major
development areas. One of these major assets totaling $102 million is expected to move to proved
properties in 2010.

Exploratory Costs  

For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or  suspended,  on the balance
sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been
discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well.

62 

Table of Contents   

If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs
remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of
 sufficient progress  is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued
capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will
improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project s development economically
profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved
reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of
which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are
actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required
approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and
the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries,
it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years
while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field
or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental
permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and
gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.

Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the
additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole
when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.
Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics
and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to
produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return
on investment.

At year-end 2009, total suspended well costs were $908 million, compared with $660 million at
year-end 2008. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see
Note 8 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Proved Reserves   

Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent
only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such
information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and
engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction
recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval
limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and
quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the
hydrocarbons.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require
disclosure of  proved  reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better
understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company s E P operations. There are
several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before
estimated reserves can be designated as  proved.  Our reservoir engineering organization has
policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained
and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by
consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.

Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually and during the year if significant changes occur,
and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as
required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be
permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs.
This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore,
as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.

Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are
reported under the  economic interest  method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude
oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If
costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to
changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve
quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves

63 

Table of Contents   

also is important to the statement of operations because the proved developed reserve estimate for
a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation, depletion
and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2009, the net book value of
productive E P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit-of-production calculation was
approximately $60 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets
in 2009 was approximately $8 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated
operations were 5.5 billion BOE at the beginning of 2009 and were 5.6 billion BOE at the end of
2009. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been
lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2009
would have increased by an estimated $424 million. Impairments of producing properties resulting
from downward revisions of proved reserves due to reservoir performance were not material in the
last three years.

Impairments 

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and
circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be
generated by an asset group and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If,
upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the
asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are
grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of
assets generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire
complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for
long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is determined based on the present values of
expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by
principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with
historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows
used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments
of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital
project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note
10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for
impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate
planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the
carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment
amount, or a current fair value less than the investment s carrying amount. When it is determined
such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference
between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a
decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time
and extent of the decline, the investee s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our
ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for
any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not
available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using
discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus
market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions
could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. For
additional information, see the  LUKOIL  and  NMNG  sections of Note 6 Investments, Loans and
Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs 

Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove
tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites.
Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas
platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos
abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these
facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs.
Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult.
Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and
regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when
the removal

64 

Table of Contents   

event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance
considerations,
 expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including
discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.

In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain
obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to
cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and
remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production
sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject
to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and
extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other responsible parties.

Business Acquisitions 

Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed  

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as
well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and
liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult
estimates of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and
identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value
determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to
finalize these fair value determinations.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill  

At December 31, 2009, we had $740 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful
lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must
be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management
determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence
at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have
indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require
management s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our
Worldwide E P reporting unit. At December 31, 2009, we had $3,638 million of goodwill remaining on
our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R M reporting unit. See Note
9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional
information on intangibles and goodwill, including a detailed discussion of the facts and
circumstances leading to the goodwill impairment, as well as the judgments required by management
in the analysis leading to the impairment determination.

Projected Benefit Obligations 

Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and
postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance
sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial
determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves
judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at
retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health
care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the
specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the
determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For
Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary
care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in
determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and
requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations
promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes
differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised
benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment
returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect
periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly
sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the
discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $140 million, while a 1 percent
decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase

65 

Table of Contents   

annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on
high-quality fixed
 income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES
LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 

This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our
forward-looking statements by the words  anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   could, 
 intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   predict,   should,   will,   expect,   objective, 
 projection,   forecast,   goal,   guidance,   outlook,   effort,   target  and similar
expressions.

We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections
about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements
are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good
faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In
addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that
may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could
result from a variety of factors, including the following:

Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and
marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. 

Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from
existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling
risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas
reservoir performance. 

Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to
exploratory acreage. 

Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. 

Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or
operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or
transportation projects. 

Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or
transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. 

Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil,
natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. 

Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for
construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply
with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. 

Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely
complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery
and transportation projects. 

Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary
weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. 

International monetary conditions and exchange controls. 

Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future
environmental rules and regulations. 

Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under
environmental regulations. 

Liability resulting from litigation. 

General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed
hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude
oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation;
other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary
fluctuations. 

Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or
royalty rules applicable to our business. 

66 

Table of Contents   

Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or
uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. 

Delays in, or our inability to implement, our recently announced asset disposition plan. 

Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of
facilities and general corporate purposes.

      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Financial Instrument Market Risk 

We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments
that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or
interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks
produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products;
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market
opportunities.

Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an  Authority Limitations  document approved by
our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative
instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations
document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these
limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior
Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and reports to the Chief Operating
Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity
flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses.

Commodity Price Risk  

We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and
electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These
fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing
activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities.

Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to
optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average
prices to accomplish the following objectives:

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration,
exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the
commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or
marketing demand. 

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market
prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often
requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. 

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural
gas, refined product and electric power transactions. 

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited
amount of commodity trading around our asset base. 

We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day
from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and
derivative

67 

Table of Contents   

commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on
the balance sheet at December 31, 2009, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a
95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for
trading purposes at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income
attributable to ConocoPhillips.

The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was
also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips.

Interest Rate Risk  

The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes in short-term U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash
flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average
variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The
carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the
fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture
acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3
percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the
obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a
year-end 2009 and 2008 effective yield rate of 2.63 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, based on
yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips 
average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

Foreign Currency Risk  

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not
comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively
hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital
projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign
affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.

68 

Table of Contents   

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term
intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge
exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed
by FASB ASC Topic 815. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps
is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or
loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or
borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent
change in the December 31, 2009 or 2008, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of
these positions at December 31, 2009 and 2008, were as follows:

*  
       
      Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR).  

**  
       
      Denominated in U.S. dollars.

Instruments and Derivative Contracts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Report of Management 

Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other
information appearing in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements present fairly
the company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated
financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments
management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company s financial statements
have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed
by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders.
Management has made available to Ernst   Young LLP all of the company s financial records and
related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders  and directors  meetings.

Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. ConocoPhillips  internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the company s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in  Internal Control Integrated Framework .
Based on our assessment, we believe the company s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2009.

Ernst   Young LLP has issued an audit report on the company s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009, and their report is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
ConocoPhillips

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included
the related condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at Item 8 and
financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements, condensed
consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed
consolidating financial information, and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2009 ConocoPhillips has changed
its reserve estimates and related disclosures as a result of adopting new oil and gas reserve
estimation and disclosure requirements.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), ConocoPhillips  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25,
2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
ConocoPhillips

We have audited ConocoPhillips  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips 
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under
the heading  Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  in the accompanying  Report
of Management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the 2009 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report
dated February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1 Accounting Policies 

Consolidation Principles and
Investments  Our consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of
majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries
and variable interest entities where we
are the primary beneficiary. The equity
method is used to account for investments
in affiliates in which we have the
ability to exert significant influence
over the affiliates  operating and
financial policies. The cost method is
used when we do not have the ability to
exert significant influence. Undivided
interests in oil and gas joint ventures,
pipelines, natural gas plants and
terminals are consolidated on a
proportionate basis. Other securities
and investments, excluding marketable
securities, are generally carried at
cost. 

Foreign Currency Translation  Adjustments
resulting from the process of translating
foreign functional currency financial
statements into U.S. dollars are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) in common stockholders  equity.
Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are included in current earnings.
Most of our foreign operations use their
local currency as the functional
currency. 

Use of Estimates  The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition  Revenues associated
with sales of crude oil, natural gas,
natural gas liquids, petroleum and
chemical products, and other items are
recognized when title passes to the
customer, which is when the risk of
ownership passes to the purchaser and
physical delivery of goods occurs, either
immediately or within a fixed delivery
schedule that is reasonable and customary
in the industry. 

Revenues associated with properties producing natural gas and crude oil, in which we have an
interest with other producers, are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the
period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working
interest, which are deemed to be nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as
accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between
volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant. 

Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase
and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into  in contemplation  of one
another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line). 

Shipping and Handling Costs  Our Exploration and Production (E P)
segment includes shipping and handling costs in production and
operating expenses for production activities. Transportation
costs related to E P marketing activities are recorded in
purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. The Refining and
Marketing (R M) segment records shipping and handling costs in
purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. Freight costs
billed to customers are recorded as a component of revenue. 

Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and have original maturities of three months or less from their
date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates fair value. 

Inventories  We have several valuation methods for our various
types of inventories and consistently use the following methods
for each type of inventory. Crude oil and petroleum products
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market in the
aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Any
necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are
recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is
used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues
and to meet tax-conformity requirements. Costs include both
direct and indirect expenditures incurred in 

78 

Table of Contents   

bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not
unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other
miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued under various
methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method,
consistent with industry practice. 

Fair Value Measurements  We categorize assets and liabilities
measured at fair value into one of three different levels
depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the
measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are
observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through
market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant
modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions
about pricing by market participants. 

Derivative Instruments  All derivative instruments are recorded on
the balance sheet at fair value in either prepaid expenses and
other current assets, other assets, other accruals, or other
liabilities and deferred credits. If the right of offset exists
and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and
liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance
sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against
derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively. 

Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a
derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains
and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or
losses from adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in
earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition of
changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses from derivative instruments that
are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign
entity will be recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings; however, to the extent the change in
the value of the derivative exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged
transaction, the excess gains or losses will be recognized immediately in earnings. 

In the consolidated statement of operations, gains and losses from derivatives that are held
for trading and not directly related to our physical business are recorded in other income.
Gains and losses from derivatives used for other purposes are recorded in sales and
other operating revenues; other income; purchased crude oil, natural gas and products; interest
and debt expense; or foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, depending on the purpose for
issuing or holding the derivatives. 

Oil and Gas Exploration and Development  Oil and gas exploration and development costs are
accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting. 

Property Acquisition Costs  Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and
included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment. Leasehold
impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management s judgment. Upon
achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the
associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties. 

Exploratory Costs  Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining
undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or
 suspended,  on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically
recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found,
exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter
potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the
balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it
is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several
years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil
and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans 

79 

Table of Contents   

or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been
obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves
are designated as proved reserves. 

Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of
the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as
dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near
term. See Note 8 Suspended Wells for additional information on suspended wells. 

Development Costs  Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including
unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized. 

Depletion and Amortization  Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of
intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated
proved developed oil and gas reserves. 

Capitalized Interest  Interest from external borrowings is
capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period
of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost
of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of
the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets. 

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill  Intangible assets that have
finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over
their useful lives. Intangible assets that have indefinite useful
lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for
impairment. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining
useful lives of intangible assets not being amortized to determine
whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite
useful lives. These indefinite lived intangibles are considered
impaired if the fair value of the intangible asset is lower than
net book value. The fair value of intangible assets is determined
based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If
quoted market prices are not available, fair value of intangible
assets is determined based upon the present values of expected
future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent
with those used by principal market participants, or upon
estimated replacement cost, if expected future cash flows from the
intangible asset are not determinable. 

Goodwill  Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not
amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. If the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than the recorded book
value of the reporting unit s assets (including goodwill), less
liabilities, then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is
performed on the reporting unit s assets and liabilities using the
fair value of the reporting unit as the purchase price in the
calculation. If the amount of goodwill resulting from this
hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the recorded
amount of goodwill, the recorded goodwill is written down to the
new amount. For purposes of goodwill impairment calculations, two
reporting units have been determined: Worldwide Exploration and
Production and Worldwide Refining and Marketing. 

Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization of
properties, plants and equipment on producing hydrocarbon
properties and certain pipeline assets (those which are expected
to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the
unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all
other properties, plants and equipment are determined by either
the individual-unit-straight-line method or the
group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are
highly integrated with other units). 

Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment  Properties, plants
and equipment used in operations are assessed for impairment
whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible
significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be
generated by an asset group and annually following updates to
corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the
undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of
the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated
fair value through additional amortization or depreciation
provisions and reported as 

80 

Table of Contents   

impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made. Individual
assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable
cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally
on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level
for refining assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived
assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values
of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by
principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with
historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. Long-lived assets committed
by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or
fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if
available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described. 

The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations
are based on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available
evidence at the date of review. If the future production price risk has been hedged, the
hedged price is used in the calculations for the period and quantities hedged. The impairment
review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any
development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable
reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the
impairment calculation. 

Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities  Investments
in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever
changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value
has occurred and annually following updates to corporate planning
assumptions. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to
be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is
written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired
investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon
the present value of expected future cash flows using discount
rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal
market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets
owned by the investee, if appropriate. 

Maintenance and Repairs  Costs of maintenance and repairs, which
are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred. 

Advertising Costs  Production costs of media advertising are
deferred until the first public showing of the advertisement.
Advances to secure advertising slots at specific sporting or other
events are deferred until the event occurs. All other advertising
costs are expensed as incurred, unless the cost has benefits that
clearly extend beyond the interim period in which the expenditure
is made, in which case the advertising cost is deferred and
amortized ratably over the interim periods that clearly benefit
from the expenditure. 

Property Dispositions  When complete units of depreciable property
are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are
eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in other income. When
less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of
or retired, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is
charged or credited to accumulated depreciation. 

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs  Fair value
of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are
recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred
(typically when the asset is installed at the production
location). When the liability is initially recorded, we
capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the
related properties, plants and equipment. Over time the liability
is increased for the change in its present value, and the
capitalized cost in properties, plants and equipment is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. See Note
11 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs,
for additional information. 

81 

Table of Contents   

Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic
benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and that
do not have a future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental
expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business
combination) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties, such
as state reimbursement funds, are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and
estimable. 

Guarantees  Fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded
as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial
liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure
under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the
relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and
circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where
the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we
have information that the liability is essentially relieved or
amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of
our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the
guarantee liability to the related statement of operations line
item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes
probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a
separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the
facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value
liability only when there is no further exposure under the
guarantee. 

Stock-Based Compensation  We recognize stock-based compensation
expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated
period of time required to earn the award); or the period
beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an
employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We elected to
recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period
for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable
or cliff vesting. 

Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes are computed using the
liability method and are provided on all temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our
assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income
considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign
subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax
credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for
income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is
reflected in interest expense, and penalties in production and
operating expenses. 

Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
Authorities  Excise taxes are reported gross within sales and
other operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes, while
other sales and value-added taxes are recorded net in taxes other
than income taxes. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock  Basic net income
(loss) per share of common stock is calculated based upon the
daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the year, including unallocated shares held by the stock savings
feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Also, this
calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have
not been issued. Diluted net income per share of common stock
includes the above, plus unvested stock, unit or option awards
granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised
stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net
income per share. Diluted net loss per share in 2008 is
calculated the same as basic net loss per share that is, it does
not assume conversion or exercise of securities, totaling
17,354,959 shares in 2008 that would have an anti-dilutive effect.
Treasury stock and shares held by the grantor trusts are excluded
from the daily weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding in both calculations.

Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles 

Reserve Estimation and Disclosures 

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) No. 2010-03,  Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures.  This ASU amends the FASB s
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 932,  Extractive Activities Oil and Gas  to align
the accounting requirements of Topic 932 with the Securities and Exchange Commission s final rule,
 Modernization of the Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements  issued on December 31, 2008. In summary,
the revisions in ASU 2010-3 modernize the disclosure rules to better align with current industry
practices and expand the disclosure requirements for equity method investments so that more useful
information is provided. More specifically, the main provisions include the following:

An expanded definition of oil and gas producing activities to include nontraditional
resources such as bitumen extracted from oil sands. 

The use of an average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the 12-month period,
rather than a year-end price for determining whether reserves can be produced
economically. 

Amended definitions of key terms such as  reliable technology  and  reasonable
certainty  which are used in estimating proved oil and gas reserve quantities. 

A requirement for disclosing separate information about reserve quantities and
financial statement amounts for geographical areas representing 15 percent or more of
proved reserves. 

Clarification that an entity s equity investments must be considered in determining
whether it has significant oil and gas activities and a requirement to disclose equity
method investments in the same level of detail as is required for consolidated
investments. 

This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods ended on or after December 31, 2009, and it
requires (1) the effect of the adoption to be included within each of the dollar amounts and
quantities disclosed, (2) qualitative and quantitative disclosure of the estimated effect of
adoption on each of the dollar amounts and quantities disclosed, if significant and practical to
estimate and (3) the effect of adoption on the financial statements, if significant and practical
to estimate. Adoption of these requirements did not significantly impact our reported reserves or
our consolidated financial statements.

Codification 

The FASB issued ASU No. 2009-01 in June 2009. This Update, also issued as FASB Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 168,  The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,  is effective for financial statements
issued after September 15, 2009. Update 2009-01 requires that the FASB s ASC become the sole
source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the FASB for
nongovernmental entities. We adopted this Update effective July 1, 2009.

Subsequent Events 

Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted FASB SFAS No. 165,  Subsequent Events.  This Statement was
codified into FASB ASC Topic 855,  Subsequent Events.  Topic 855 establishes the accounting for,
and disclosure of, material events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the
financial statements are issued. In general, these events will be recognized if the condition
existed at the date of the balance sheet, and will not be recognized if the condition did not exist
at the balance sheet date. Disclosure is required for nonrecognized events if required to keep the
financial statements from being misleading. The guidance in this Topic is very similar to previous
guidance provided in auditing literature and, therefore, did not result in significant changes in
practice.

Business Combinations 

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised),  Business Combinations  (SFAS No.
141(R)), which was subsequently amended by FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 141(R)-1 in April 2009.
This Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations.  Topic 805 applies
prospectively to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more other
businesses on or after January 1, 2009. In general, Topic 805 requires the acquiring entity in a
business combination to recognize the fair value of all

83 

Table of Contents   

assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition date as the
fair value measurement point; and modifies disclosure requirements. It also modifies the
accounting treatment for transaction costs, in-process research and development, restructuring
costs, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of a business combination,
and changes in income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date. Additionally, effective
January 1, 2009, accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets
and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations impact tax expense
instead of goodwill.

Noncontrolling Interests 

Effective January 1, 2009, we implemented SFAS No. 160,  Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51.  This Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic
810,  Consolidation.  Topic 810 requires noncontrolling interests, previously called minority
interests, to be presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance
sheet. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling
interests to be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated income statement. Additionally,
Topic 810 clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not
result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, and that deconsolidation of a subsidiary
requires gain or loss recognition in net income based on the fair value on the deconsolidation
date. Topic 810 was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure
requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented, and did not
significantly change the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. FASB ASU No.
2010-02,  Accounting and Reporting for Decreases in Ownership of a Subsidiary a Scope
Clarification,  clarified the decrease in ownership provision of Topic 810 applies to a group of
assets or a subsidiary that is a business, but was not applicable to sales of in-substance real
estate, or conveyances of oil and gas mineral rights.

Derivatives 

Effective January 1, 2009, we implemented SFAS No. 161,  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB No. 133.  This Statement was codified into FASB ASC
Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging.  The amendments to Topic 815 expanded disclosure requirements
to provide greater transparency for derivative instruments. In addition, we now must include an
indication of the volume of derivative activity by category (e.g., interest rate, commodity and
foreign currency); derivative gains and losses, by category, for the periods presented in the
financial statements; and expanded disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features. See
Note 16 Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, for additional information.

Fair Value Measurement 

Effective January 1, 2008, we implemented SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements.  This Statement
was codified primarily into FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  This
Topic defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. We elected to implement this guidance with the one-year deferral
permitted for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value, except those
that are recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis (at least annually). Following the allowed
one-year deferral, effective January 1, 2009, we implemented Topic 820 for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The implementation covers
assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination; impaired properties,
plants and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill; initial recognition of asset retirement
obligations; and restructuring costs for which we use fair value. There was no impact to our
consolidated financial statements from the implementation of this Topic for nonfinancial assets and
liabilities, other than additional disclosures.

Financial Instruments 

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,  The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.  This Statement was
codified into FASB ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments.  Topic 825 permits the election to carry
financial instruments and certain other items similar to financial instruments at fair value on the
balance sheet, with all changes in fair value reported in earnings. By electing the fair value
option in conjunction with a derivative, an entity can achieve an accounting result similar to a
fair value hedge without having to comply with complex hedge accounting rules. We adopted this
Statement effective January 1, 2008, but did not make a fair value election at that time or during
the remaining period of 2008 through the year 2009 for any financial instruments not

84 

Table of Contents   

already carried at fair value in accordance with other accounting standards. Accordingly, the
adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Compensation Retirement Benefits 

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,  Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).  This
Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic 715,  Compensation Retirement Benefits.  Topic 715
requires an employer that sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans to:

Recognize the funded status of the benefit in its statement of financial position. 

Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses
and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not recognized as
components of net periodic benefit cost. 

Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s
fiscal year-end statement of financial position. 

Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain
effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed
recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the transition
asset or obligation. 

We adopted the provisions of this Statement effective December 31, 2006, except for the requirement
to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end,
which we adopted effective December 31, 2008. For information on the impact of the adoption of
this Statement, see Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans.

Equity Method Accounting 

In November 2008, the FASB reached a consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 08-6,
 Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations  (EITF 08-6). EITF 08-6 was codified into FASB
ASC Topic 323,  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures.  EITF 08-6 was issued to clarify
how the application of equity method accounting is affected by SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160.
Topic 323 clarifies that an entity shall continue to use the cost accumulation model for its equity
method investments. It also confirms past accounting practices related to the treatment of
contingent consideration and the use of the impairment model under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 18,  The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.  Additionally,
it requires an equity method investor to account for a share issuance by an investee as if the
investor had sold a proportionate share of the investment. This Topic was effective January 1,
2009, and applies prospectively. The adoption did not impact our consolidated financial
statements.

Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities 

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8,  Disclosures about Transfers of
Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest Entities.  This FSP was codified into FASB ASC
Topic 810,  Consolidation.  Topic 810 requires additional disclosures about an entity s
involvement with a variable interest entity (VIE) and certain transfers of financial assets to
special-purpose entities and VIEs. This FSP was effective December 31, 2008, and the additional
disclosures related to VIEs have been incorporated into Note 3 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs),
including the methodology for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, whether
we have provided financial or other support we were not contractually required to provide, and
other qualitative and quantitative information. We did not have any transfers of financial assets
within the scope of Topic 810.

Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets 

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1,  Employers  Disclosures about Postretirement
Benefit Plan Assets,  to improve the transparency associated with disclosures about the plan assets
of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This Statement was codified into FASB
ASC Topic 715,  Compensation Retirement Benefits.  Topic 715 requires the disclosure of each
major asset class at fair value using the fair value hierarchy in SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value
Measurements.  This Topic is effective

85 

Table of Contents   

for annual financial statements beginning with the 2009 fiscal year, but did not impact our
consolidated financial statements, other than requiring additional disclosures. For more
information on this disclosure, see Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans.

Note 3 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) 

We hold significant variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not
considered the primary beneficiary. Information on these VIEs follows. See Note 26 New
Accounting Standards, for information affecting the accounting for VIEs effective January 1, 2010.

We have a 30 percent ownership interest with a 50 percent governance interest in the OOO
Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture to develop resources in the Timan-Pechora province of
Russia. The NMNG joint venture is a VIE because we and a related party, OAO LUKOIL, have
disproportionate interests. When related parties are involved in a VIE, reasonable judgment should
take into account the relevant facts and circumstances for the determination of the primary
beneficiary. The activities of NMNG are more closely aligned with LUKOIL because they share Russia
as a home country, and LUKOIL conducts extensive exploration activities in the same province.
Additionally, there are no financial guarantees given by LUKOIL or us, and LUKOIL owns 70 percent,
versus our 30 percent direct interest. As a result, we have determined we are not the primary
beneficiary of NMNG, and we use the equity method of accounting for this investment. The funding of
NMNG has been provided with equity contributions, primarily for the development of the Yuzhno
Khylchuyu (YK) Field. Initial production from YK was achieved in June 2008. At December 31, 2009,
the book value of our investment in the venture was $1,647 million.

Production from the NMNG joint venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL s terminal at
Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets. LUKOIL
completed an expansion of the terminal s gross oil-throughput capacity from 30,000 barrels per day
to 240,000 barrels per day, and we participated in the design and financing of the expansion. The
terminal entity, Varandey Terminal Company, is a VIE because we and LUKOIL have disproportionate
interests. We had an obligation to fund, through loans, 30 percent of the terminal s expansion
costs, but have no governance or direct ownership interest in the terminal. Similar to NMNG, we
determined we are not the primary beneficiary for Varandey because of LUKOIL s ownership, the
activities are in LUKOIL s home country, and LUKOIL is the operator of Varandey. We account for
our loan to Varandey as a financial asset. Terminal expansion was completed in June 2008.
Principal repayments began in April 2009. The loan balance outstanding as of December 31, 2009, at
current exchange rates, was $278 million.

We have an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a
liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in
Freeport LNG; however, we own a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc. (Freeport GP), which
serves as the general partner managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with
Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We
also entered into a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of
regasification capacity. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and we began making
payments under the terminal use agreement. Freeport LNG began making loan repayments in September
2008, and the loan balance outstanding as of December 31, 2009, was $707 million. Freeport LNG is
a VIE because Freeport GP holds no equity in Freeport LNG, and the limited partners of Freeport LNG
do not have any substantive decision making ability. We performed an analysis of the expected
losses and determined we are not the primary beneficiary. This expected loss analysis took into
account that the credit support arrangement requires Freeport LNG to maintain sufficient commercial
insurance to mitigate any loan losses. The loan to Freeport LNG is accounted for as a financial
asset, and our investment in Freeport GP is accounted for as an equity investment.

In the third quarter of 2009, Ashford Energy Capital S.A. redeemed for $500 million, plus accrued
dividends, the investment in Ashford held by Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. Accordingly, we wholly
own Ashford, and it is no longer a VIE.

Table of Contents   

Our ownership in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, was previously reported as a VIE because a third
party with no ownership interest had a 49 percent voting interest through the end of the
construction phase of the pipeline. With completion of construction in November 2009, our
ownership increased from 24 to 25 percent and is now aligned with our voting interest. Rockies
Express Pipeline is no longer considered a VIE.

Note 4 Inventories 

Inventories at December 31 were:

Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $3,747 million and $3,939 million at December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively. The excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories
amounted to $5,627 million and $1,959 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In
2007, a liquidation of LIFO inventory values increased net income attributable to ConocoPhillips
$280 million, of which $260 million was attributable to our R M segment.

Note 5 Assets Held for Sale 

At December 31, 2008, we classified $594 million of noncurrent assets, primarily properties, plants
and equipment, and $92 million of noncurrent liabilities, primarily deferred taxes, as held for
sale on the consolidated balance sheet. During 2009, we closed on the sale of a large part of our
U.S. retail marketing assets, which included seller financing in the form of a $370 million
five-year note and letters of credit totaling $54 million. In addition, we had other dispositions
during the year and some assets were classified back into held for use. Also during 2009, we
classified additional marketing assets as held for sale. Accordingly, at December 31, 2009, we
classified $323 million of noncurrent assets, primarily investments in equity affiliates, as held
for sale and most of this amount is included in  Prepaid expenses and other current assets.  We
also classified $75 million of noncurrent deferred tax liabilities as current, based on their held
for sale status.

Equity Investments 

Affiliated companies in which we have a significant equity investment include:

Australia Pacific LNG 50 percent owned joint venture with Origin Energy to develop
coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat Basins in Queensland, Australia, as
well as process and export LNG. 

FCCL Partnership 50 percent owned business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. produces
bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta and sells the bitumen blend. 

WRB Refining LLC 50 percent owned business venture with Cenovus owns the Wood River
and Borger Refineries, which process crude oil into refined products. 

OAO LUKOIL 20 percent ownership interest explores for and produces crude oil, natural
gas and natural gas liquids; refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum
products; and is headquartered in Russia. 

OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) 30 percent ownership interest and a 50 percent governance
interest a joint venture with LUKOIL to explore for, develop and produce oil and gas
resources in the northern part of Russia s Timan-Pechora province. 

DCP Midstream, LLC 50 percent owned joint venture with Spectra Energy owns and
operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation plants. 

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) 50 percent owned joint venture with
Chevron Corporation manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. 

Summarized 100 percent financial information for equity method investments in affiliated companies,
combined, was as follows (information included for LUKOIL is based on estimates):

Our share of income taxes incurred directly by the equity companies is reported in equity in
earnings of affiliates, and as such is not included in income taxes in our consolidated financial
statements.

At December 31, 2009, retained earnings included $1,504 million related to the undistributed
earnings of affiliated companies. Distributions received from affiliates were $2,882 million,
$3,259 million and $3,326 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Australia Pacific LNG 

In October 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy
company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. The 50/50 joint
venture, Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and
Surat Basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. This transaction gives
us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position with the expected
creation of an additional LNG hub targeting the Asia Pacific markets.

Under the terms of the transaction, we paid $5 billion at closing, which after the effect of
hedging gains, resulted in an initial cash acquisition cost of $4.7 billion. In addition, we are
responsible for AU$1.15 billion related to Origin s initial share of joint venture funding
requirements, as incurred. We have committed to

88 

Table of Contents   

make up to four additional payments of $500 million each, expected within the next decade,
conditional on up to four LNG trains being approved by the joint venture for development.

At December 31, 2009, the book value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $7,344 million,
which includes $2,196 million of cumulative translation effects due to a strengthening Australian
dollar. Our 50 percent share of the historical cost basis net assets of APLNG on its books under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $659 million, resulting in a basis
difference of $6,698 million on our books. The amortizable portion of the basis difference, $4,692
million associated with properties, plants and equipment, has been allocated on a relative fair
value basis to individual exploration and production license areas owned by APLNG, most of which
are not currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a
similar manner. Each exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of
potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference
amortization. As the joint venture begins producing natural gas from each license, we amortize the
basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net
income attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2009 and 2008 was after-tax expense of $4 million and $7
million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently
producing licenses.

FCCL and WRB 

In January 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation (now Cenovus) to create an
integrated North American heavy oil business. The transaction consists of two 50/50 business
ventures, a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Partnership, and a U.S. downstream limited
liability company, WRB Refining LLC. We use the equity method of accounting for both entities,
with the operating results of our investment in FCCL reflecting its use of the full-cost method of
accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.

At December 31, 2009, the book value of our investment in FCCL was $8,318 million. FCCL s
operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage
bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern
Alberta. Cenovus is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. We are obligated to contribute
$7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period that began in 2007. For
additional information on this obligation, see Note 13 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation.

At December 31, 2009, the book value of our investment in WRB was $2,975 million. WRB s operating
assets consist of the Wood River and Borger Refineries, located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger,
Texas, respectively. As a result of our contribution of these two assets to WRB, a basis
difference was created due to the fair value of the contributed assets recorded by WRB exceeding
their historical book value. The difference is primarily amortized and recognized as a benefit
evenly over a period of 25 years, which is the estimated remaining useful life of the refineries at
the closing date. The basis difference at December 31, 2009, was $4,344 million. Equity earnings
in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were increased by $209 million, $246 million and $202 million, respectively,
due to amortization of the basis difference. We are the operator and managing partner of WRB.
Cenovus is obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year
period that began in 2007. For the Wood River Refinery, operating results are shared 50/50
starting upon formation. For the Borger Refinery, we were entitled to 85 percent of the operating
results in 2007, with our share decreasing to 65 percent in 2008, and 50 percent in all years
thereafter.

LUKOIL 

LUKOIL is an integrated energy company headquartered in Russia, with operations worldwide. Our
ownership interest was 20 percent at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, based on 851 million shares
authorized and issued. For financial reporting under U.S. GAAP, treasury shares held by LUKOIL are
not considered outstanding for determining our equity method ownership interest in LUKOIL. Our
ownership interest, based on estimated shares outstanding at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was
20.09 percent, 20.06 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively.

Because LUKOIL s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occur
subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings for our LUKOIL investment are estimated,
based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL information, and other objective
data. Once the

89 

Table of Contents   

difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This
estimate-to-actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period results.

Since the inception of our investment and through June 30, 2008, the market value of our investment
in LUKOIL exceeded book value, based on the price of LUKOIL American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on
the London Stock Exchange. However, the price of LUKOIL ADRs experienced significant decline
during the second half of 2008, and traded for most of the fourth quarter and into early 2009 in
the general range of $25 to $40 per share. The ADR price ended the year at $32.05 per share, or 67
percent lower than the June 30, 2008, price. This resulted in a December 31, 2008, market value of
our investment of $5,452 million, or 58 percent lower than our book value. Based on a review of
the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in the market value of our investment during
the second half of 2008, we concluded that an impairment of our investment was necessary. In
reaching this conclusion, we considered the length of time market value has been below book value
and the severity of the decline in market value to be important factors. In combination, these two
items caused us to conclude that the decline was other than temporary.

Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $7,410 million, before- and after-tax impairment, in our
fourth-quarter 2008 results. This impairment had the effect of reducing our book value to $5,452
million, based on the market value of LUKOIL ADRs on December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2009, the book value of our investment in LUKOIL was $6,861 million. Our 20
percent share of the net assets of LUKOIL was estimated to be $11,314 million. This negative basis
difference of $4,453 million is primarily being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 22-year
useful life as an increase to equity earnings. Equity earnings in 2009 were increased $209
million, while equity earnings in 2008 and 2007 were reduced $88 million and $77 million,
respectively, due to amortization of the positive basis difference that existed prior to the 2008
year-end investment impairment. On December 31, 2009, the closing price of LUKOIL shares on the
London Stock Exchange was $57.30 per share, making the aggregate total market value of our LUKOIL
investment $9,747 million.

NMNG 

NMNG is a joint venture with LUKOIL, created in June 2005, to develop resources in the northern
part of Russia s Timan-Pechora province. We have a 30 percent direct ownership interest with a 50
percent governance interest. At December 31, 2009, the book value of our equity method investment
in NMNG was $1,647 million. NMNG is nearing completion of the development of the YK Field, which
achieved initial production in June 2008. Production from the NMNG joint venture fields is
transported via pipeline to LUKOIL s existing terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then
shipped via tanker to international markets. During 2009, we reduced the carrying value of our
NMNG investment, reflecting an other-than-temporary decline in fair value primarily attributable to
lower probable resources in the YK area.

DCP Midstream 

DCP Midstream owns and operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation
plants. At December 31, 2009, the book value of our equity method investment in DCP Midstream was
$1,003 million. DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under
a supply agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. Beginning in 2015, the volume
commitment is reduced by 20 percent each year until the volume commitment is zero. This purchase
commitment is on an  if-produced, will-purchase  basis and so has no fixed production schedule, but
has had, and is expected over the remaining term of the contract to have, a relatively stable
purchase pattern. Natural gas liquids are purchased under this agreement at various published
market index prices, less transportation and fractionation fees.

CPChem 

CPChem manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. At December 31, 2009, the book value
of our equity method investment in CPChem was $2,445 million. We have multiple supply and purchase
agreements in place with CPChem, ranging in initial terms from one to 99 years, with extension
options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined products, solvents, and
petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and gases. Delivery
quantities vary by product, and are generally on an  if-produced, will-purchase  basis. All
products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing
indices, consistent with terms extended to third-party customers.

Loans to Related Parties 

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we invest
and enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share
costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. Included in such
activity are loans made to certain affiliated companies. Loans are recorded when cash is
transferred to the affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase
as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance and will decrease as interest and principal
payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreement s stated interest rate. Loans are
assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance may not be fully recovered.

Significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:

$707 million in loan financing to Freeport LNG Development, L.P. for the construction of
an LNG receiving terminal that became operational in June 2008. Freeport began making
repayments in September 2008. 

$278 million in loan financing at December 2009 exchange rates to Varandey Terminal
Company associated with the costs of the terminal expansion. The terminal expansion was
completed in June 2008, and principal repayments began in April 2009. 

$1,000 million of project financing and an additional $88 million of accrued interest to
Qatargas 3, which is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar s
North Field. We own a 30 percent interest in the project. The other participants in the
project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui   Co., Ltd. (1.5
percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas
Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured
project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from
export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from
ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as
the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all
loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants
based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this
financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, which is expected in
2011, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will
become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2009, Qatargas 3 had
approximately $3.6 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities. 

$350 million of loan financing to WRB Refining LLC to assist it in meeting its
operating and capital spending requirements. 

The long-term portion of these loans are included in the  Loans and advances related parties  line
on the consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in  Accounts and notes
receivable related parties. 

Other Investments 

We have investments remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis to support certain nonqualified
deferred compensation plans. The fair value of these assets at December 31, 2009, was $338
million, and substantially the entire value is categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
These investments are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quotations from
national securities exchanges.

Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) is a limited partnership that owns a 70,000 barrel-per-day delayed coker
and related facilities at the Sweeny Refinery used to produce fuel-grade petroleum coke. Prior to
August 28, 2009, MSLP was owned 50/50 by us and Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Under the agreements that govern the
relationships between the partners, certain defaults by PDVSA with respect to supply of crude oil
to the Sweeny Refinery gave us the right to acquire PDVSA s 50 percent ownership interest in MSLP.
On August 28, 2009, we exercised that right. In public statements, PDVSA has challenged our
actions. We continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in MSLP.

Note 7 Properties, Plants and Equipment 

Properties, plants and equipment (PP E) are recorded at cost. Within the E P segment, depreciation
is mainly on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life will vary by field. In the R M
segment, investments in refining manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a
straight-line basis over a 25-year life, and pipeline assets over a 45-year life. The company s
investment in PP E, with accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (Accum. DD A), at

Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles 

Goodwill 

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

Goodwill Impairment 

We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year. During the
fourth quarter of 2008, there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in
global economic activity which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and
oil-and-gas-related commodity prices, both of which contributed to a significant decline in our
company s stock price and corresponding market

93 

Table of Contents   

capitalization. For most of the fourth quarter, our market capitalization value was significantly
below the recorded net book value of our balance sheet, including goodwill.

Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply
judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of
performing the annual goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make
these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using
discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets. A key component of these fair
value determinations is a reconciliation of the sum of these net present value calculations to our
market capitalization. We use an average of our market capitalization over the 30 calendar days
preceding the impairment testing date as being more reflective of our stock price trend than a
single day, point-in-time market price. Because, in our judgment, Worldwide E P is considered to
have a higher valuation volatility than Worldwide R M, the long-term free cash flow growth rate
implied from this reconciliation to our recent average market capitalization is applied to the
Worldwide E P net present value calculation.

The accounting principles regarding goodwill acknowledge that the observed market prices of
individual trades of a company s stock (and thus its computed market capitalization) may not be
representative of the fair value of the company as a whole. Substantial value may arise from the
ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another
entity. Consequently, measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that
operate together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of that entity s
individual common stock. In most industries, including ours, an acquiring entity typically is
willing to pay more for equity securities that give it a controlling interest than an investor
would pay for a number of equity securities representing less than a controlling interest.
Therefore, once the above net present value calculations have been determined, we also add a
control premium to the calculations. This control premium is judgmental and is based on observed
acquisitions in our industry. The resultant fair values calculated for the reporting units are
then compared to observable metrics on large mergers and acquisitions in our industry to determine
whether those valuations, in our judgment, appear reasonable.

After determining the fair values of our various reporting units as of December 31, 2008, it was
determined that our Worldwide R M reporting unit passed the first step of the goodwill impairment
test, while our Worldwide E P reporting unit did not pass the first step. As described above, the
second step of the goodwill impairment test uses the estimated fair value of Worldwide E P from the
first step as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. The
significant hypothetical purchase price allocation adjustments made to the assets and liabilities
of Worldwide E P in this second step calculation were in the areas of:

Adjusting the carrying value of major equity method investments to their estimated fair
values. 

Adjusting the carrying value of properties, plants and equipment (PP E) to the estimated
aggregate fair value of all oil and gas property interests. 

Recalculating deferred income taxes under FASB ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  after considering the likely tax basis a hypothetical buyer would have in the
assets and liabilities. 

When determining the above adjustment for the estimated aggregate fair value of PP E, it was noted
that in order for any residual purchase price to be allocated to goodwill, the purchase price
assigned to PP E would have to be well below the value of the PP E implied by recently-observed
metrics from other sales of major oil and gas properties.

Based on the above analysis, we concluded that a $25.4 billion before- and after-tax noncash
impairment of the entire amount of recorded goodwill for the Worldwide E P reporting unit was
required. This impairment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Expropriated Assets 

Ecuador   
In April 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated
arbitration before the World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) against The Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador as a result of the newly-enacted Windfall
Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite
a restraining order issued by the ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington
and its co-venturer and sold the illegally

95 

Table of Contents   

seized crude oil. As a result, our assets in Ecuador were effectively expropriated. Accordingly,
in the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a noncash charge of $51 million before- and after-tax
related to the full impairment of our exploration and production investments in Ecuador. In the
third quarter of 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Block 7 and 21, formalizing the complete
expropriation of our assets. A jurisdictional hearing before the ICSID was held in January 2010,
with the outcome still pending.

Venezuela   
On January 31, 2007, Venezuela s National Assembly passed a law allowing the president of Venezuela
to pass laws on certain matters by decree. On February 26, 2007, the president of Venezuela issued
a decree (the Nationalization Decree) mandating the termination of the then-existing structures
related to our heavy oil ventures and oil production risk contracts and the transfer of all rights
relating to our heavy oil ventures and oil production risk contracts to joint ventures (  empresas
mixtas  ) that will be controlled by the Venezuelan national oil company or its subsidiaries.

On June 26, 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration
to an  empresa mixta  structure mandated by the Nationalization Decree. In response, Petr leos de
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) or its affiliates directly assumed the activities associated with
ConocoPhillips  interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro
oil development project. Based on Venezuelan statements that the expropriation of our oil
interests in Venezuela occurred on June 26, 2007, management determined such expropriation required
a complete impairment, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, of our investments in
the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro oil development project.
Accordingly, we recorded a noncash impairment, including allocable goodwill, of $4,588 million
before-tax ($4,512 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2007.

The impairment included equity method investments and properties, plants and equipment. Also, this
expropriation of our oil interests is viewed as a partial disposition of our Worldwide E P
reporting unit and required an allocation of goodwill to the expropriation event. The amount of
goodwill impaired as a result of this allocation was $1,925 million.

We filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the ICSID, an arm of the
World Bank. The request was registered by the ICSID on December 13, 2007. The tribunal of three
arbitrators is constituted, and the arbitration proceeding is under way.

We believe the value of our expropriated Venezuelan oil operations substantially exceeds the
historical cost-based carrying value plus goodwill allocable to those operations. However, U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles require a claim that is the subject of litigation be
presumed to not be probable of realization. In addition, the timing of any negotiated or
arbitrated settlement is not known at this time, but we
anticipate it could take years. Accordingly, any compensation for our expropriated assets was not
considered when making the impairment determination, since to do so could result in the recognition
of compensation for the expropriation prior to its realization.

Other Impairments 

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized the following before-tax impairment charges, excluding
the goodwill, LUKOIL investment and expropriated assets impairments noted above:

2009   
During 2009, we recorded property impairments of $417 million in our E P segment, primarily as a
result of lower natural gas price assumptions, reduced volume forecasts, and higher royalty,
operating cost and capital expenditure assumptions. We also recorded property impairments of $66
million in our R M segment, primarily associated with planned asset dispositions.

The following table shows the values of assets at December 31, 2009, by major category, measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition.

Net properties, plants and equipment held for use with a carrying amount of $610 million were
written down to a fair value of $210 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $385 million
(including impact of exchange rates). The fair values were determined by the application of an
internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices and a discount
rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.

During the year, net properties, plants and equipment held for sale with a carrying amount of $178
million were written down to a fair value of $121 million ($91 million still unsold at year end),
less cost to sell of $5 million for a net $116 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $62
million. The fair values were largely based on binding negotiated prices with third parties, with
some adjusted for the fair value of certain liabilities retained.

At December 31, 2009 certain equity method investments associated with our E P segment were
determined to have a fair value below carrying amount and the impairment was considered to be other
than temporary. As a result, those investments with a book value of $2,070 million were written
down to a fair value of $1,784 million resulting in a charge of $286 million before-tax, which is
included in the  Equity in earnings of affiliates  line of the consolidated statement of
operations. The fair values were determined by the application

97 

Table of Contents   

of an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices and a
discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, as well
as reference to market analysis of certain similar undeveloped properties owned by one of the
investees.

2008   
As a result of the economic downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008, the outlook for crude oil and
natural gas prices, refining margins, and power spreads sharply deteriorated. In addition, current
project economics in our E P segment resulted in revised capital spending plans. Because of these
factors, certain E P, R M and Emerging Businesses properties no longer passed the undiscounted cash
flow tests and had to be written down to fair value. Consequently, we recorded property
impairments of approximately $1,480 million, primarily consisting of various producing fields in
the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada, one U.S. and one European refinery and a U.S. power generation
facility. In addition, we recorded property impairments for increased asset retirement
obligations, vacant office buildings in the United States and canceled R M capital projects.

2007   
During 2007, we recorded property impairments of $257 million associated with planned asset
dispositions in our E P and R M segments. E P also recorded additional property impairments in
2007 resulting from increased asset retirement obligations, downward reserve revisions and higher
projected operating costs for certain fields in North America and the United Kingdom and an
abandoned project in Alaska. R M recorded additional property impairments associated with various
terminals and pipelines, primarily in the United States. Also, we reported a $128 million benefit
in 2007 for the subsequent increase in the fair value of certain assets impaired in the prior year,
primarily to reflect finalized sales agreements. This gain was included in the
 Impairments Other  line of the consolidated statement of operations.

Note 11 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs 

Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31 were:

*  
       
      Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet, under the caption  Other accruals.  Includes $14 million related to assets held for sale in 2008.  

Asset Retirement Obligations 

We are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation when it
is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability
is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the
related properties, plants and equipment. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its
present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.

We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract
once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to
be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company
resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve removal and disposal
of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines
in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries.

98 

Table of Contents   

During 2009 and 2008, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows:

Accrued Environmental Costs 

Total environmental accruals at December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $1,017 million and $979 million,
respectively. The 2009 increase in total accrued environmental costs is due to new accruals,
accrual adjustments and accretion exceeding payments during the year on accrued environmental
costs.

We had accrued environmental costs of $632 million and $652 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at
U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at
exploration and production sites. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $292 million and $234
million of environmental costs associated with nonoperator sites at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. In addition, $93 million was included at both December 31, 2009 and 2008, where the
company has been named a potentially responsible
party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or
similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities will be paid over periods extending up to 30
years.

Because a large portion of the accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business
combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected expenditures for acquired environmental
obligations are discounted using a weighted-average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an
accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $627 million at December 31, 2009. The
expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs
that have been discounted are: $90 million in 2010, $87 million in 2011, $67 million in 2012, $48
million in 2013, $39 million in 2014, and $358 million for all future years after 2014.

Note 12 Debt 

Long-term debt at December 31 was:

100 

Table of Contents   

Maturities of long-term borrowings, inclusive of net unamortized premiums and discounts, in
2010 through 2014 are: $1,728 million, $3,972 million, $2,345 million, $1,277 million and $1,532
million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, we had classified $1,060 million of short-term debt
as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis
under our revolving credit facilities.

In February 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due
2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039, and in May 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.60%
Notes due 2015, $1.0 billion of 6.00% Notes due 2020 and an additional $500 million of 6.50% Notes
due 2039. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper
balances and for general corporate purposes.

During 2009, we used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to redeem $284 million of
6.375% Notes and $950 million of Floating Rate Notes upon their maturity, and prepaid $750 million
of Floating Rate Five-Year Term Notes.

At December 31, 2009, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $7.85 billion, consisting of
a $7.35 billion facility expiring in September 2012 and a $500 million facility expiring in July
2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for
issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper
programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and
do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of
specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision
relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or
more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.

Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated
banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime
rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment
fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if
our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of
Directors.

We have two commercial paper programs: the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion program, primarily a
funding source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5
billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3
Project. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At both December 31, 2009
and 2008, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40
million in letters of credit had been issued. In addition, under the two commercial paper
programs, there was $1,300 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2009, compared
with $6,933 million at December 31, 2008. Since we had $1,300 million of commercial paper
outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.5 billion in
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2009.

Note 13 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation 

On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation (now Cenovus). As a
part of the transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year
period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL Partnership, formed as a result
of the transaction. An initial cash contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January
of 2007, and was included in the  Capital expenditures and investments  line on our consolidated
statement of cash flows.

Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and
will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $660
million was short-term and was included in the  Accounts payable related parties  line on our
December 31, 2009, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which
totaled $625 million in 2009, is included in the  Other  line in the financing activities section
of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3
percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is
reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the  Capital expenditures and investments 
line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Note 14 Guarantees 

At December 31, 2009, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual
arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our
obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of
the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were
issued prior to December 31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In
addition, unless otherwise stated we are not currently performing with any significance under the
guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of
occurrence.

Construction Completion Guarantees 

In December 2005, we issued a construction completion guarantee for 30 percent of the $4
billion in loan facilities of Qatargas 3, which are being used to finance the construction of
an LNG train in Qatar. Of the $4 billion in loan facilities, we committed to provide $1.2
billion. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the
guarantee is estimated to be $850 million, which could become payable if the full debt
financing is utilized and completion of the Qatargas 3 Project is not achieved. The project
financing will be nonrecourse to ConocoPhillips upon certified completion, expected in 2011.
At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of the guarantee to third-party lenders was $11
million. 

Guarantees of Joint Venture Debt 

In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for our ownership percentage of $2 billion in credit
facilities of Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P.
At December 31, 2009, Rockies Express had $1,673 million outstanding under the credit
facilities, with our 25 percent guarantee equaling $418 million. The maximum potential
amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $500
million, which could become payable if the credit facilities are fully utilized and Rockies
Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. The guarantee expires in
April 2011. At December 31, 2009, the total carrying value of this guarantee to third-party
lenders was $11 million. 

At December 31, 2009, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint venture debt
obligations, which have terms of up to 16 years. The maximum potential amount of future
payments under the guarantees is approximately $80 million. Payment would be required if a
joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. 

Other Guarantees 

In conjunction with our purchase of a 50 percent ownership interest in APLNG from Origin
Energy in October 2008, we agreed to participate, if and when requested, in any parent
company guarantees that were outstanding at the time we purchased our interest in APLNG.
These parent company guarantees cover the obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under
several sales agreements with remaining terms of 7 to 22 years. Our maximum potential
amount of future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to
be $1,450 million ($3,140 million in the event of intentional or reckless breach) at December
2009 exchange rates based on our 50 percent share of the remaining contracted volumes, which
could become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the
obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the
payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough
natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the partners do not make necessary equity
contributions into APLNG. 

We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling $506
million, which consist primarily of dealer and jobber loan guarantees to support our
marketing business, guarantees to fund the short-term cash liquidity deficits of certain
joint ventures, a guarantee of minimum charter revenue for two LNG vessels, one small
construction completion guarantee, guarantees relating to the startup of a refining joint
venture, guarantees of the lease payment obligations of a joint venture, and guarantees of
the residual value of leased corporate aircraft. At December 31, 

102 

Table of Contents   

2009, the carrying value of these guarantees to third-party lenders was $1 million. These
guarantees generally extend up to 15 years or life of the venture. 

In the third quarter of 2009, we sold our remaining ownership interest in four Keystone Pipeline
entities to TransCanada Corporation. As a result, we no longer have any financial guarantees
related to Keystone.

Indemnifications 

Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain
corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. Agreements
associated with these sales include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, permits
and licenses, employee claims, real estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and litigation. The
terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related
to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments
is generally unlimited. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at December 31,
2009, was $412 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period,
if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In cases
where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have
information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate
time period as the fair value of our indemnification exposure declines. Although it is reasonably
possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it
is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments.
Included in the recorded carrying amount were $258 million of environmental accruals for known
contamination that are included in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at
December 31, 2009. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note
15 Contingencies and Commitments.

Note 15 Contingencies and Commitments 

In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a
liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other
amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential
insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance
or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a
cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than
certain. See Note 20 Income Taxes, for additional information about income-tax-related
contingencies.

Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to
known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning
contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other
potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent
liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future
environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain
magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be
required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible
parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events
evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation
processes.

Environmental 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These may result in
obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage,
disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various sites. When
we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities
based on management s best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We
measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and
presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business
considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in

103 

Table of Contents   

remediation of contaminated sites, other companies  cleanup experience, and data released by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims
in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both
probable and reasonably estimable.

Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is
generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually
only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities,
we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated
as a potentially responsible party. If we were solely responsible, the costs, in some cases, could
be material to our results of operations, capital resources or liquidity, or to those of one of our
segments. However, settlements and costs incurred in matters that previously have been resolved
have not been material to our results of operations or financial condition. We have been
successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the
sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state
agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the
site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some
instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that
other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share,
we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals
accordingly.

As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations.
Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our
benefit and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits. We have not
recorded accruals for any potential contingent liabilities that we expect to be funded by the prior
owners under these indemnifications.

We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal
Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup
and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase
business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and
remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs
can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries.
In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and
proceedings. See Note 11 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a
summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.

Legal Proceedings 

Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific
characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the
legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of
potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that
have been scheduled for trial, as well as the pace of settlement discussions in individual matters.
Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and
available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization believes
there is a remote likelihood future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will
exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

Other Contingencies 

We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing
companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required
to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related
to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2009, we had performance
obligations secured by letters of credit of $1,624 million (of which $40 million was issued under
the provisions of our revolving credit facility, and the remainder was issued as direct bank
letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and
items of permanent investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business. See Note
10 Impairments, for additional information about expropriated assets in Ecuador and Venezuela and
the contingencies related to receiving adequate compensation for our oil interests related to these
assets.

104 

Table of Contents   

Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements 

We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing
arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be
used in the ordinary course of the company s business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments
under these various agreements are: 2010 $88 million; 2011 $88 million; 2012 $84 million;
2013 $83 million; 2014 $84 million; and 2015 and after $273 million. Total payments under the
agreements were $77 million in 2009, $75 million in 2008 and $67 million in 2007.

Note 16 Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts 

Derivative Instruments 

We use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, or to capture market
opportunities. Since we are not currently using hedge accounting, all gains and losses, realized
or unrealized, from derivative contracts have been recognized in the consolidated statement of
operations. Gains and losses from derivative contracts held for trading not directly related to
our physical business, whether realized or unrealized, have been reported net in other income.

Purchase and sales contracts for commodities that are readily convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil,
natural gas and gasoline) are recorded on the balance sheet as derivatives unless the contracts are
for quantities we expect to use or sell over a reasonable period in the normal course of business
(i.e., contracts eligible for the normal purchases and normal sales exception). We record most of
our contracts to buy or sell natural gas and the majority of our contracts to sell power as
derivatives, but we do apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception to certain long-term
contracts to sell our natural gas production. We generally apply this normal purchases and normal
sales exception to eligible crude oil and refined product commodity purchase and sales contracts;
however, we may elect not to apply this exception (e.g., when another derivative instrument will be
used to mitigate the risk of the purchase or sale contract but hedge accounting will not be
applied, in which case both the purchase or sales contract and the derivative contract mitigating
the resulting risk will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value).

We value our exchange-cleared derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the
balance sheet date, and these are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Over-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts
are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers and price index developers such as Platts
and Oil Price Information Service. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are
classified as Level 2. In certain less liquid markets or for longer-term contracts, forward prices
are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC swaps and physical commodity purchase
and sale contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical
relationships among various commodities that result in management s best estimate of fair value.
These contracts are classified as Level 3.

Exchange-cleared financial options are valued using exchange closing prices and are classified as
Level 1. Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry-standard models
that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value,
volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other
relevant economic measures. The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets
determines whether the options are classified as Level 2 or 3.

We use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid and ask prices). When
appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit considerations, generally based on available
market evidence.

105 

Table of Contents   

The fair value hierarchy for our derivative assets and liabilities accounted for at fair
value on a recurring basis was:

The derivative values above are based on analysis of each contract as the fundamental unit of
account; therefore, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are not reflected
net where the legal right of offset exists. Gains or losses from contracts in one level may be
offset by gains or losses on contracts in another level or by changes in values of physical
contracts or positions that are not reflected in the table above.

The fair value of net commodity derivatives classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy
changed as follows during 2009 and 2008:

The amounts of Level 3 gains (losses) included in earnings were:

Commodity Derivative Contracts  We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined product, natural
gas, natural gas liquids and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices
for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of
operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the
market prices of commodities. However, we use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various
markets to balance physical systems, meet customer needs, manage price exposures on specific
transactions, and do a limited, immaterial amount of trading not directly related to our physical
business. These activities may move our risk profile away from market average prices.

Credit Risk 

Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash equivalents, over-the-counter derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash
equivalents are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds and time deposits with
major international banks and financial institutions.

The credit risk from our over-the-counter derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives
from the counterparty to the transaction, typically a major bank or financial institution.
Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use
of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We
also use futures contracts, but futures have a negligible credit risk because they are traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange or the ICE Futures.

Our trade receivables result primarily
from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which
limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment
 terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the
 counterparties. We do not generally require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however,
we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate
 credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the
amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due us.

 Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the
derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and
other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The
variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and
fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the
primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as
collateral.

The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related contingent
features that were in a liability position on December 31, 2009, was $381 million, for which no
collateral was posted. If our credit rating were lowered one level from its  A  rating (per
Standard and Poor s) on December 31, 2009, we would be required to post no additional collateral to
our counterparties. If we were downgraded below investment grade, we would be required to post
$381 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments 

We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
approximates fair value. 

Accounts and notes receivable: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
approximates fair value. 

Investment in LUKOIL shares: See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables,
for a discussion of the carrying value and fair value of our investment in LUKOIL shares. 

Debt: The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates fair value. The fair
value of the fixed-rate debt is estimated based on quoted market prices. 

Fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation: Fair value is estimated
based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a December 31
effective yield rate of 2.63 percent, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of
similar average duration adjusted for our average credit risk spread and the amortizing
nature of the obligation principal. See Note 13 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, for
additional information. 

Swaps: Fair value is estimated based on forward market prices and approximates the exit
price at period end. When forward market prices are not available, they are estimated
using the forward prices of a similar commodity with adjustments for differences in quality
or location. 

109 

Table of Contents   

Futures: Fair values are based on quoted market prices obtained from the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the ICE Futures, or other traded exchanges. 

Forward-exchange contracts: Fair value is estimated by comparing the contract rate
to the forward rate in effect on December 31 and approximates the exit price at that date. 

Certain of our commodity derivative and financial instruments at December 31 were:

The amounts shown for derivatives in the preceding table are presented net (i.e., assets and
liabilities with the same counterparty are netted where the right of offset and intent to net
exist). In addition, the 2009 commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of $70
million of obligations to return cash collateral and $148 million of rights to reclaim cash
collateral, respectively. The 2008 commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of $123
million of obligations to return cash collateral and $332 million of rights to reclaim cash
collateral, respectively. No collateral was deposited or held for the foreign currency
derivatives.

Note 17 Equity 

Common Stock 

The changes in our shares of common stock, as categorized in the equity section of the balance
sheet, were:

Preferred Stock 

We have 500 million shares of preferred stock authorized, par value $.01 per share, none of which
was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2009 or 2008.

110 

Table of Contents   

Noncontrolling Interests 

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had outstanding $590 million and $1,100 million, respectively, of
equity in less-than-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest owners.
The decrease from 2008 was primarily due to Ashford Energy Capital S.A., a wholly owned
consolidated subsidiary,
redeeming for $500 million, plus accrued dividends, the investment in Ashford held by Cold Spring
Finance S.a.r.l. in the third quarter of 2009. The difference between the redemption amount and
the carrying value of the investment was $12 million. The redemption amount was included as a cash
outflow in the  Other  line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of
cash flows.

The remaining noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we
control. The largest of these, amounting to $565 million at December 31, 2009, and $580 million at
December 31, 2008, was related to Darwin LNG operations, located in Australia s Northern Territory.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights 

In 2002, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and directed the issuance of one right per
common share for any newly issued shares. The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The
rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire ConocoPhillips
on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. However, since the rights may either be redeemed
or otherwise made inapplicable by ConocoPhillips prior to an acquirer obtaining beneficial
ownership of 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips  common stock, the rights should not interfere
with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors prior to that
occurrence. The rights, which expire June 30, 2012, will be exercisable only if a person or group
acquires 15 percent or more of the company s common stock or commences a tender offer that would
result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the common stock. Each right would entitle
stockholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of $300.
If an acquirer obtains 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips  common stock, then each right will be
adjusted so that it will entitle the holder (other than the acquirer, whose rights will become
void) to purchase, for the then exercise price, a number of shares of ConocoPhillips  common stock
equal in value to two times the exercise price of the right. In addition, the rights enable
holders to purchase the stock of an acquiring company at a discount, depending on specific
circumstances. We may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, for one cent per right.

Note 18 Non-Mineral Leases 

The company leases ocean transport vessels, tugboats, barges, pipelines, railcars, corporate
aircraft, service stations, drilling equipment, computers, office buildings and other facilities
and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect
changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased property
for the fair market value at the end of the lease term. There are no significant restrictions
imposed on us by the leasing agreements in regards to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing
ability. Leased assets under capital leases were not significant in any period presented.

At December 31, 2009, future minimum rental payments due under noncancelable leases were:

*   
       
      Includes $53 million related to railcars subleased to Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, a
related party.  

111 

Table of Contents   

Operating lease rental expense for the years ended December 31 was:

*   
       
      Includes $21 million, $22 million and $27 million of contingent rentals in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Contingent rentals primarily are related to retail sites and refining
equipment, and are based on volume of product sold or throughput.  

Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans 

Pension and Postretirement Plans 

An analysis of the projected benefit obligations for our pension plans and accumulated benefit
obligations for our postretirement health and life insurance plans follows:

112 

Table of Contents   

For both U.S. and international pensions, the overall expected long-term rate of return is
developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation
of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in
developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.

At December 31, 2007, all of our plans used a December 31 measurement date, except for a plan in
the United Kingdom, which had a September 30 measurement date. To comply with the provisions of
SFAS No. 158,  Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),  as codified into FASB ASC Topic 715,
 Compensation Retirement Benefits,  we changed the measurement date for the U.K. plan from
September 30 to December 31 for our 2008 consolidated financial statements. We elected to
implement the change by remeasuring the U.K. plan assets and obligations as of December 31, 2007.
To implement the change in measurement date, we recognized the $10 million (net of tax) of net
periodic pension cost incurred from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007, as an adjustment to 2008
beginning retained earnings.

Included in other comprehensive income at December 31 were the following before-tax amounts that
had not been recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost:

For our tax-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets,
the projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan
assets were $7,145 million, $5,653 million, and $4,748 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009
and $6,092 million, $5,289 million, and $3,624 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008.

For our unfunded nonqualified key employee supplemental pension plans, the projected benefit
obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation were $419 million and $355 million, respectively,
at December 31, 2009, and were $391 million and $334 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008.

114 

Table of Contents   

The components of net periodic benefit cost of all defined benefit plans are presented in the
following table:

We recognized pension settlement losses of $15 million, $18 million and $2 million and special
termination benefits of $5 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Curtailment losses of $1 million were recognized in 2007.

In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive
benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the
unamortized balance each year.

We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health
care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and
company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The
measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend
rate of 8.25 percent in 2010 that declines to 5.0 percent by 2023. A one-percentage-point change
in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on the 2009 amounts:

Plan Assets  We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes,
investment managers, and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets have no significant
concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S.
equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate, and private
equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment
program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are 56 percent equity
securities, 35 percent debt securities, 5 percent real estate, and 4 percent in all other types of
investments. Generally, the investments in the plans are publicly traded, therefore minimizing
liquidity risk in the portfolio.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There
have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

115 

Table of Contents   

Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of cash equivalents categorized
in Level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates.

Fair values of diversified equity securities, preferred stock and government debt securities
categorized in Level 1 are primarily based on quoted market prices.

Fair values of diversified corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and government
debt securities categorized in Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and
market price quotations. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income
security, its fair market value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against
other securities with actual market prices. When observable price quotations are not available,
fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g.,
observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads for similar
securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund
based on the fair value of the underlying assets.

Fair values of mutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset
value of shares held.

Fair values of derivatives, which include options and swaps, are generally calculated from pricing
models with market input parameters from third-party sources. Also included in this category are
cash and short-term investments required to be held as collateral by brokers based on the fair
value of certain derivative instruments. Some derivatives are publicly traded, and fair values for
these are based on quoted market prices.

Private equity funds are valued at fair value using a variety of methods including consideration of
the initial cost of securities or properties acquired, recent transactions in the same or
comparable securities or properties, fundamental analytical techniques, real estate valuation
techniques and other methods that reference third-party sources for discount and capitalization
rates.

Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments
owed by the insurance company to the Plans  participants.

Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other
methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.

A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity
contract. This participating interest is calculated as the market value of investments held under
this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The participation
interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a
combination of comparison to quoted market prices and estimation using recently executed
transactions and market price quotations for contract assets, and an actuarial present value
computation for contract obligations. At December 31, 2009, the participating interest in the
annuity contract was valued at $94 million and consisted of $349 million in debt securities, less
$255 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December 31, 2008,
the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $138 million and consisted of
$400 million in debt securities, less $262 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered
by the contract. The net change from 2008 to 2009 is due to a decrease in the fair market value of
the underlying investments of $51 million and a decrease in the present value of the contract
obligation of $7 million. The participating interest is not available for meeting general pension
benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new
benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Level 3 plan assets
for the year ended December 31, 2009:

Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2010, we
expect to contribute approximately $530 million to our domestic qualified and nonqualified pension
and postretirement benefit plans and $230 million to our international qualified and nonqualified
pension and postretirement benefit plans.

Table of Contents   

The following benefit payments, which are exclusive of amounts to be paid from the
participating annuity contract and which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are
expected to be paid:

Severance Accrual 

As a result of the 2008 business environment s impact on our operating and capital plans, a
reduction in our overall employee work force occurred in 2009. Various business units and staff
groups recorded accruals in the fourth quarter of 2008 for severance and related employee benefits
totaling $162 million. The following table summarizes our severance accrual activity at December
31:

The remaining balance at December 31, 2009, of $12 million is classified as short term.

Defined Contribution Plans 

Most U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP).
Employees can deposit up to 30 percent of their eligible pay up to the statutory limit ($16,500 in
2009) in the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 38 investment funds.
ConocoPhillips matches contribution deposits, up to 1.25 percent of eligible pay. Company
contributions charged to expense for the CPSP and predecessor plans, excluding the stock savings
feature (discussed below), were $23 million in 2009, $28 million in 2008, and $26 million in 2007.

The stock savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Employees may
elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of eligible pay and
receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to the amount of contribution.

In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings
feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of
company common stock. Since the company guarantees the CPSP s borrowings, the unpaid balance is
reported as a liability of the company and unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common
stockholders  equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is
serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common
stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings
feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service
payments on CPSP borrowings. In addition, during the period from 2010 through 2013,

118 

Table of Contents   

when no debt principal payments are scheduled to occur, we have committed to make direct
contributions of stock to the stock savings feature of the CPSP, or make prepayments on CPSP
borrowings, to ensure a certain minimum level of stock allocation to participant accounts.

We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair market value
of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the
shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to the stock savings feature of
$83 million, $111 million and $148 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, all of which was
compensation expense. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we contributed 2,018,692 shares, 1,668,456 shares
and 1,856,224 shares, respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits
Trust. The shares had a fair market value of $94 million, $120 million and $155 million,
respectively. Dividends used to service debt were $39 million, $41 million and $39 million in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense
recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $2 million,
$6 million and $11 million, respectively.

The total CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December 31 were:

The fair value of unallocated shares at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $274 million and $373
million, respectively.

We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms
and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation expense recognized for these
international plans was approximately $51 million in 2009, $53 million in 2008 and $44 million in
2007.

Share-Based Compensation Plans 

The 2009 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by
shareholders in May 2009. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 70 million
shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees, directors and consultants; however,
as of the effective date of the Plan, (i) any shares of common stock available for future awards
under the prior plans and (ii) any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the
prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of shares of common stock
or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available
for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Of the 70
million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40 million shares of common
stock are available for incentive stock options, and no more than 40 million shares are available
for awards in stock.

Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the
remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of
their retirement. For share-based awards granted prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
codified into FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation,  we recognize expense over the
period of time during which the employee earns the award, accelerating the recognition of expense
only when an employee actually retires. For share-based awards granted after our adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, we recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of
the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period
beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for
retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an
award to not be subject to forfeiture.

Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times)
while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). For awards
granted prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) that vest ratably, we recognize expense on a
straight-line basis over the service period for

119 

Table of Contents   

each separate vesting portion of the award (i.e., as if the award was multiple awards with
different requisite service periods). For share-based awards granted after our adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R), we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire
award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.

Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income and the associated tax benefit for the
three years ended December 31, 2009, was as follows:

Stock Options  Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and earlier plans permit
purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock
on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest
ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary
date following the date of grant. Options awarded to employees already eligible for retirement
vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end
of the normal vesting period.

The following summarizes our stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2009:

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of vested options and exercisable options at
December 31, 2009, was 3.57 years and 3.21 years, respectively.

120 

Table of Contents   

During 2009, we received $59 million in cash and realized a tax benefit of $20 million from the
exercise of options. At December 31, 2009, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from
unvested options was $16 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 14
months, the longest period being 25 months.

The significant assumptions used to calculate the fair market values of the options granted over
the past three years, as calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, were as
follows:

The ranges in the assumptions used were as follows:

We calculate volatility using the most recent ConocoPhillips end-of-week closing stock prices
spanning a period equal to the expected life of the options granted. We periodically calculate the
average period of time lapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants to estimate the
expected life of new option grants.

Stock Unit Program  Stock units granted under the provisions of the Plan vest ratably, with
one-third of the units vesting in 36 months, one-third vesting in 48 months, and the final third
vesting 60 months from the date of grant. Upon vesting, the units are settled by issuing one share
of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to employees already eligible for
retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those units are not issued as shares until
the end of the normal vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the units receive
a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. The grant date fair
value of these units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the date of
grant. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while
unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net
present value of the dividends that will not be received.

The following summarizes our stock unit activity for the three years ended December 31,
2009:

At December 31, 2009, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested units was $162
million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 24 months, the longest period
being 49 months.

Performance Share Program  Under the Plan, we also annually grant to senior management restricted
stock units that do not vest until either (i) with respect to awards for periods beginning before
2009, the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or
(ii) with respect to awards for periods beginning in 2009, five years after the grant date of the
award (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until retirement after
reaching age 55 with five years of service), so we recognize compensation expense for these awards
beginning on the date of grant and ending on the date the units are scheduled to vest. Since these
awards are authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for such
retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period
beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. These units are settled by
issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Until issued as stock, recipients of
the units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. In
its current form, the first grant of units under this program was in 2006.

The following summarizes our Performance Share Program activity for the three years ended December
31, 2009:

At December 31, 2009, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested Performance Share
awards was $43 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 42 months, the
longest period being 12 years.

Other  In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and
restricted stock units that were either issued to replace awards held by employees of companies we
acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the
recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.

The following summarizes the aggregate activity of these restricted shares and units for the three
years ended December 31, 2009:

Compensation and Benefits Trust 

The Compensation and Benefits Trust (CBT) is an irrevocable grantor trust, administered by an
independent trustee and designed to acquire, hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund
certain future compensation and benefit obligations of the company. The CBT does not increase or
alter the amount of benefits or compensation that will be paid under existing plans, but offers us
enhanced financial flexibility in providing the funding requirements of those plans. We also have
flexibility in determining the timing of distributions of shares from the CBT to fund compensation
and benefits, subject to a minimum distribution schedule. The trustee votes shares held by the CBT
in accordance with voting directions from eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement
with the trustee.

We sold 58.4 million shares of previously unissued company common stock to the CBT in 1995 for $37
million of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us, and a promissory note from the CBT to us
of $952 million. The CBT is consolidated by ConocoPhillips; therefore, the cash contribution and
promissory note are eliminated in consolidation. Shares held by the CBT are valued at cost and do
not affect earnings per share or total common stockholders  equity until after they are transferred
out of the CBT. In 2009 and 2008, shares transferred out of the CBT were 2,018,692 and 1,668,456,
respectively. At December 31, 2009, the CBT had 38.5 million shares remaining. All shares are
required to be transferred out of the CBT by January 1, 2021. The CBT, together with two smaller
grantor trusts, comprise the  Grantor trusts  line in the equity section of the consolidated
balance sheet.

Note 20 Income Taxes 

Income taxes charged to income (loss) were:

124 

Table of Contents   

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax
purposes. Major components of deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31 were:

Current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities included deferred
taxes of $581 million, $21 million, $5 million and $17,962 million, respectively, at December 31,
2009, and $457 million, $58 million, $1 million and $18,167 million, respectively, at December 31,
2008.

We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally
expire between 2010 and 2029 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.

Valuation allowances have been established for certain loss and credit carryforwards that reduce
deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During 2009,
valuation allowances increased a total of $200 million. This reflects increases of $224 million
primarily related to U.S. foreign tax credit and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards and
currency effects, partially offset by decreases of $24 million related to utilization of loss
carryforwards and asset relinquishment. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for
the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects remaining net deferred tax
assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax
consequences of future taxable income.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign
subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $2,129 million and $3,871
million, respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do not
plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not practicable
to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income if
distributed.

Table of Contents   

The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits
for 2009,  2008 and 2007.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2009, 2008  and 2007 were $931 million, $862
million and $698 million, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. The increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily due to the effect of FASB ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations. 

At December 31, 2009, 2008  and 2007, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $166 million,
 $147 million and $137 million,  respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties affecting
earnings in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $14 million, $28 million and $46 million, respectively.

We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and
state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United
Kingdom (2007), Canada (2003), United States (2004) and Norway (2008). Issues in dispute for
audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in
the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in
unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably
possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits,
but the amount of change is not estimable.

126 

Table of Contents   

The amounts of U.S. and foreign income (loss) before income taxes, with a reconciliation of tax at
the federal statutory rate with the provision for income taxes, were:

Our effective tax rate in 2009 was 51 percent, compared with a negative 381 percent in 2008. The
change in the effective tax rate from 2008 was primarily due to the impact of impairments relating
to goodwill and to our LUKOIL investment taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. For additional
information on the impairments, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles and Note 6 Investments, Loans
and Long-Term Receivables.

Tax rate changes in 2009 and 2008 did not have a significant impact on our income tax expense. Our
2007 tax expense was decreased $204 million and $141 million, respectively, due to remeasurement of
deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax rate reductions in Canada and Germany.

Note 26 New Accounting Standards 

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166,  Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.  This Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic 860,
 Transfers and Servicing.  This Statement removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose
entity (SPE) and the exception for qualifying SPEs from the consolidation guidance. Additionally,
the Statement clarifies the requirements for financial asset transfers eligible for sale
accounting. This Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Also in June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,  Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),  to
address the effects of the elimination of the qualifying SPE concept in SFAS No. 166, and other
concerns about the application of key provisions of consolidation guidance for VIEs. This
Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic 810,  Consolidation.  More specifically, SFAS No. 167
requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of
a VIE, it amends certain guidance pertaining to the determination of the primary beneficiary when
related parties are involved, and it amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a
VIE. Additionally, this Statement requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the
primary beneficiary of a VIE. This Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Oil and Gas Operations  (Unaudited)

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 932,  Extractive Activities Oil and Gas,  and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration
and production operations.

These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our
proportionate share of our equity affiliates  oil and gas activities, covering both those in our
Exploration and Production (E P) segment, as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a
result, amounts reported as Equity Affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown
in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report. The data included for the
LUKOIL Investment segment reflects the company s estimated share of OAO LUKOIL s amounts. Because
LUKOIL s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity share of financial
information and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated based on current market
indicators, publicly available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference
between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. Our estimated year-end
2009 reserves related to our equity investment in LUKOIL are based on LUKOIL s year-end 2009
reserve estimates and include adjustments to conform them to ConocoPhillips  reserves policy.

Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs),
which are reported under the  economic interest  method and are subject to fluctuations in prices
of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital
costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change
inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable
reserve quantities would decline. At December 31, 2009, approximately 12 percent of our total
proved reserves, excluding LUKOIL, were under PSCs, primarily in our Asia Pacific/Middle East
geographic reporting area.

Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and
the United Kingdom), Russia, Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa, and Other Areas. Other Areas
primarily consists of the Caspian Region, as well as the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil projects
in Venezuela, which were expropriated in 2007, and Ecuador, which was expropriated in 2009.
Certain previously reported amounts for 2008 and 2007 appearing in the following oil and gas
operations schedules have been reclassified between line items to conform to the current year
presentation.

On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued its final rules to modernize the supplemental oil and gas
disclosures, and in January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03,  Oil and
Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures.  As a result of these two new rules, our disclosures
reflect the expanded definitions for oil and gas producing activities, including nontraditional
resources such as our Syncrude operations. The inclusion of Syncrude as part of our oil and gas
producing activities, effective January 1, 2009, did not have a significant impact on our
disclosures. In the following disclosures, our synthetic oil classification includes our Syncrude
mining operations, and our bitumen classification includes our Surmont operations and the FCCL
Partnership. In addition, we have applied the 12-month average price rather than year-end price
for determining economic producibility of reserves, revised our geographic areas, and expanded
disclosures for equity investments to the same level of detail as required for consolidated
investments.

We own a 9 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. (SCL) joint venture, created for the
purpose of mining shallow deposits of oil sands, extracting the bitumen, and upgrading it into a
light sweet synthetic crude oil called Syncrude. The primary plant and facilities are located at
Mildred Lake, about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. SCL, as operator of the joint
venture, holds eight oil sands leases and the associated surface rights, of which our share is
approximately 22,400 net acres. Net production averaged 23,000 barrels per day in 2009.

Table of Contents   

Reserves Governance  

The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations
of the SEC and FASB. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically
producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably
certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably
certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved reserves are further
classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that
can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating
methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of
a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time
of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped
reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage,
or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.

We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination
and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers
in our E P business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business
unit s reserves are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company s Reserves
Compliance and Reporting Manager. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geologists
and finance personnel, reviews the business units  reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and
company policy through on-site visits and review of documentation. In addition to providing
independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and
appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management
and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management and our internal audit group.
The team is responsible for maintaining and communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is
available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues
throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of
equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.

The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the company s reserve
estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual is a petroleum
engineer with a bachelor s degree in petroleum engineering. He is an active member of the Society
of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) with over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience, including
drilling and production engineering assignments in several field locations. He is currently
serving a three-year term on the Oil   Gas Reserves Committee of the SPE and has held positions of
increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, reserves reporting and compliance, and business
management.

Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the
 Critical Accounting Estimates  section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding
these estimates.

2007 for our equity affiliate operations, revisions were primarily attributable to LUKOIL. 

Extensions and Discoveries  : In 2009 in Russia, extensions and discoveries were
attributable to drilling success in various LUKOIL fields.

Revisions  : In 2009 and 2008, revisions in Alaska were primarily due to higher
prices in 2009, versus 2008; and lower prices in 2008, compared with 2007, respectively. In
2009 for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, revisions resulted from
modified coalbed methane drilling plans in Australia. In Russia, revisions were attributable
to positive performance in various LUKOIL fields. In 2008, revisions in Russia primarily
resulted from a revised assessment of the reasonable certainty of project development and of
the marketability of non-contracted gas volumes. 

Purchases  : In 2008 for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East,
purchases relate to our Australia Pacific LNG joint venture to develop coalbed methane. 

Extensions and Discoveries  : In 2009 for our equity affiliate operations in Asia
Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries primarily resulted from drilling success in
Australia related to a coalbed methane project.

Revisions  : In 2009 for synthetic oil consolidated operations, revisions reflect our
Syncrude Canada Ltd. operations, which are now considered an oil and gas activity under the
new FASB and SEC rules and regulations. For our bitumen consolidated operations, revisions
primarily were related to the sanction of the Surmont Phase II Project. For our bitumen
equity affiliate operations, revisions were mainly the result of the effect of higher prices
on sliding scale royalty provisions. 

Purchases  : In 2007 for our bitumen equity affiliate operations, purchases reflect
the formation of FCCL. 

Extensions and Discoveries  : In 2009 for our bitumen consolidated operations,
extensions and discoveries were related to the sanction of the Surmont Phase II Project. For
our equity affiliate operations, extensions and discoveries mainly reflect the approval of the
FCCL Christina Lake Phase 1D Project. In 2007 for our bitumen equity affiliate operations,
extensions and discoveries were primarily associated with FCCL.

Natural gas reserves are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on a 6:1 ratio:
six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves  

Our total proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2009, were 3,087 million BOE.

The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 52 percent, 156 percent and 77
percent of our total net additions in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During these years, we
converted, on average, 13 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed
reserves. During 2009, we converted approximately 370 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves
to proved developed.

Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, relating to the development of
proved undeveloped reserves were $4.2 billion, $4.8 billion, and $4.3 billion, respectively.

Approximately 80 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2009 were associated with
eight major development areas in our E P segment; and our investment in LUKOIL. Six of the major
development areas within E P are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves
convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or
production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include:

FCCL oil sands Christina Lake and Foster Creek in Canada. 

The Surmont oil sands project in Canada. 

The Ekofisk Field in the North Sea. 

Certain fields in the United States. 

146 

Table of Contents   

The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan, will
have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production.

At the end of 2009, we did not have any material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves in
individual fields or countries that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. However, our
largest concentrations of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2009 are located in the Athabasca
oil sands in Canada, consisting of the FCCL and Surmont steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
projects. The majority of our proved undeveloped reserves in this area were first recorded in 2006
and 2007, and we expect a material portion of these reserves will remain undeveloped for more than
five years.

Our SAGD projects are large, multi-year projects with steady, long-term production at consistent
levels. The associated reserves are expected to be developed over many years as additional well
pairs are drilled across the extensive resource base to maintain throughput at the central
processing facilities.

equipment and administrative expenses related to the production activity. 

Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes. 

Exploration expenses include dry hole costs, leasehold impairments, geological and
geophysical expenses, the costs of retaining undeveloped leaseholds, and depreciation of
support equipment and administrative expenses related to the exploration activity. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) in Results of Operations differs from that
shown for total E P in Note 25 Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, mainly due to depreciation of support equipment being
reclassified to production or exploration expenses, as applicable, in Results of Operations.
In addition, other earnings include certain E P activities, including their related DD A
charges. 

Transportation costs include costs to transport our produced hydrocarbons to their points
of sale, as well as processing fees paid to process natural gas to natural gas liquids. The
profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are deemed
to be outside oil and gas producing activities. The net income of the transportation
operations is included in other earnings. 

Other related expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other
miscellaneous expenses. 

The provision for income taxes is computed by adjusting each country s income before income
taxes for permanent differences related to oil and gas producing activities that are reflected
in our consolidated income tax expense for the period, multiplying the result by the country s
statutory tax rate, and adjusting for applicable tax credits. Included in 2007 for Canada is
a benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2007 Canadian
graduated tax rate reduction.

 Step-out exploratory wells are wells drilled in areas near or offsetting current production, for which we cannot
demonstrate with certainty that there is continuity of production from an existing productive formation. These are
classified as exploratory wells because we cannot attribute proved reserves to these locations.

Table of Contents   

Costs incurred include capitalized and expensed items. 

Acquisition costs include the costs of acquiring proved and unproved hydrocarbon
properties. In 2008, equity affiliate acquisition costs were due to the Australia Pacific LNG
joint venture with Origin Energy. In 2007, equity affiliate acquisition costs reflect the
formation of FCCL. 

Exploration costs include geological and geophysical expenses, the cost of retaining
undeveloped leaseholds, and exploratory drilling costs. 

Development costs include the cost of drilling and equipping development wells and building
related production facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing hydrocarbons. 

158 

Table of Contents   

Capitalized Costs  

Capitalized costs include the cost of equipment and facilities for oil and gas
producing activities. These costs include the activities of our E P and LUKOIL Investment
segments, excluding pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, crude
oil and natural gas marketing activities, and downstream operations. 

Proved properties include capitalized costs for leaseholds holding proved reserves,
development wells and related equipment and facilities (including uncompleted development well
costs), mining facilities associated with our synthetic oil operations, and support equipment. 

Unproved properties include capitalized costs for leaseholds under exploration (including
where hydrocarbons were found but determination of the economic viability of the required
infrastructure is dependent upon further exploratory work under way or firmly planned) and for
uncompleted exploratory well costs, including exploratory wells under evaluation.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve
Quantities  

In accordance with new SEC and FASB requirements, amounts for 2009 were computed using 12-month
average prices and end-of-year costs (adjusted only for existing contractual changes), appropriate statutory tax rates
and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor. Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month. Prior year
amounts were computed using end-of-year prices and costs. For all years, continuation of year-end
economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves,
which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which
may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as
to the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing and amount of future
development, including dismantlement, and production costs.

While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value
of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained
from their development and production.

Sources of Change in Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 

* 
      Includes taxes other than income taxes.  

** 
      Includes amounts resulting from changes in the timing of production.  

The net change in prices, and production and transportation costs is the
beginning-of-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual change in the
per-unit sales price, and production and transportation cost, discounted at 10 percent. 

For 2009, as required, purchases and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions,
discoveries and improved recovery, are calculated using production forecasts of the applicable
reserve quantities for the year multiplied by the 12-month average sales prices, less future
estimated costs, discounted at 10 percent. For prior years the end-of-year sales prices were
used, as required. 

The accretion of discount is 10 percent of the prior year s discounted future cash inflows,
less future production, transportation and development costs. 

The net change in income taxes is the annual change in the discounted future income tax
provisions.

Supplementary Information Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 

We have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company, ConocoPhillips
Australia Funding Company, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, and ConocoPhillips Canada
Funding Company II, with respect to publicly held debt securities. ConocoPhillips Company is
wholly owned by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company is an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and
ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II are indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.
ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment
obligations of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I,
and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, with respect to their publicly held debt securities.
Similarly, ConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of
ConocoPhillips Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities. In addition,
ConocoPhillips Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of
ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly held debt securities. All guarantees are joint and
several. The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the results of
operations, financial position and cash flows for:

ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company, ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company,
ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II (in
each case, reflecting investments in subsidiaries utilizing the equity method of
accounting). 

All other nonguarantor subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips. 

The consolidating adjustments necessary to present ConocoPhillips  results on a
consolidated basis. 

In February 2009, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which
ConocoPhillips, as a well-known seasoned issuer, has the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate
amount of various types of debt and equity securities, with certain debt securities guaranteed by
ConocoPhillips Company. Also as part of that registration statement, ConocoPhillips Trust I and
ConocoPhillips Trust II have the ability to issue and sell preferred trust securities, guaranteed
by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have not issued any
trust-preferred securities under this registration statement, and thus have no assets or
liabilities. Accordingly, columns for these two trusts are not included in the condensed
consolidating financial information.

To facilitate the restructuring of certain legal entities within the Canada operating unit,
ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I (CFC I) entered into a transaction with another wholly
owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips (included in the  All Other Subsidiaries  column) whereby it
acquired an investment in certain preferred shares of a Canadian legal entity within the
ConocoPhillips group, in exchange for a non-interest-bearing demand note payable. The value
ascribed to the preferred shares and note payable represented the redemption price for both. This
noncash transaction was effective December 31, 2009. As a result, the balance sheet of CFC I
reflects a short-term investment of $2,973 million and a corresponding amount in short-term debt.
In January 2010, the preferred shares acquired under the above transaction were resold to the
original holder at the same value as the original purchase price, as satisfaction of the obligation
under the demand note payable. A pro forma presentation of CFC I s December 31, 2009, balance
sheet reflecting this subsequent event would show balances of $-0- in short-term investments and
short-term debt. As these transactions were completed between wholly owned subsidiaries of
ConocoPhillips, there is no impact on the consolidated results in either period.

This condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.

4. 
       
     The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and
maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

(a) 
       
     Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this
report is being prepared; 

(b) 
       
     Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal

financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the
registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
over financial reporting; and 

5. 
       
     The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the
audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
