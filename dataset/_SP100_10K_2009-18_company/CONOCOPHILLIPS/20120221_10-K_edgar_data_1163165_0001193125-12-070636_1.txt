    PART   I    
  Unless otherwise indicated,  the company,   we,   our,   us  and  ConocoPhillips  are used in this
report to refer to the businesses of ConocoPhillips and its consolidated subsidiaries. Items 1 and 2 Business and Properties, contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies,
objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words  anticipate,   estimate,   believe, 
 budget,   continue,   could,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   predict,   seek,   should,   will,   would, 
 expect,   objective,   projection,   forecast,   goal,   guidance,   outlook,   effort,   target  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the
company s disclosures under the heading  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,  beginning on page 73.   
   Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTI  ES        C  ORPORATE STRUCTURE       ConocoPhillips is an international,
integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and
Phillips was consummated on August 30, 2002.      Our business is organized into six operating segments:   

Exploration and Production (E P)  This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas,
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.      

Midstream  This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets
natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.      

Refining and Marketing (R M)  This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the
United States, Europe and Asia.      

LUKOIL Investment  This segment consists of our past investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil
and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.      

Chemicals  This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50
percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).      

Emerging Businesses  This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations.
        At December 31, 2011, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 29,800 people.   
   Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses       On July 14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via
a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream
segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company.   
         1   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   The separation would be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for
every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips  shareholders on the record date for such distribution.      In October 2011,
we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66
Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 14, 2011, and an amendment on January 3, 2012.      The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 2012.       SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATI  ON    
  For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25 Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.          EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E P) 
      At December 31, 2011, our E P segment represented 67 percent of ConocoPhillips  total assets. This segment primarily
explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Operations to liquefy natural gas, transport and market the resulting LNG are also included in the E P segment. At
December 31, 2011, our E P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia.
     The E P segment does not include the financial results or statistics from our prior investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which
are reported in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, references to results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E P segment discussion exclude amounts related to LUKOIL. However, our share of LUKOIL is included in the
 Oil and Gas Operations  disclosures, as well as in the following net proved reserves table, for periods before we ceased using equity-method accounting for this investment, which occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2010.
     The information listed below appears in the  Oil and Gas Operations  disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:       

Proved worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil reserves.      

Net production of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil.      

Average sales prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil.      

Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).      

Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.      

Developed and undeveloped acreage.

  Index to Financial Statements  

   The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the  Oil and Gas
Operations  disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 80 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion
of factors that will enhance the understanding of the table below.       
    In 2011, E P s worldwide production, including its share of equity affiliates, averaged 1,619,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day (BOED), compared with 1,752,000 BOED in 2010. During 2011, 653,000 BOED were produced in the United States, a 5 percent decrease from 686,000 BOED in 2010. Production from our international E P operations averaged
966,000 BOED in 2011, a 9 percent decrease from 1,066,000 BOED in 2010. Worldwide production decreased primarily due to suspended operations in Libya and Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was
largely offset by new production.      E P s worldwide annual average crude oil and natural gas liquids sales price increased 34 percent,
from $72.77 per barrel in 2010 to $97.22 per barrel in 2011. Worldwide bitumen prices increased 18 percent, from $53.06 per barrel in 2010 to $62.56 per barrel in 2011. E P s average annual worldwide natural gas sales price increased 7
percent, from $4.98 per thousand cubic feet in 2010 to $5.34 per thousand cubic feet in 2011.      E P UNITED STATES   
  In 2011, U.S. E P operations contributed 45 percent of E P s worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of natural gas production.

        Greater Prudhoe Area        The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska s North Slope, is
the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant which processes natural gas for reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and
Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.        Greater Kuparuk
Area        We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which is made up of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater
and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay on Alaska s North Slope. Field installations include three central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. The
natural gas is either used for fuel or compressed for reinjection.        Western North Slope     
  On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik.
Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In December 2011, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted us a permit required to build a gravel road, bridge and pipeline crossing over the Nigliq channel of the Colville River for development of a
satellite field west of Alpine in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPRA), the Alpine West CD5 Project. We plan to incorporate the terms of the permit into our project plan as we progress project sanctioning of CD5 in 2012. Initial
production is anticipated toward the end of 2015.        Cook Inlet Area        We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Plant in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit, while we own 33.3 percent of the
Beluga River Unit. Our share of production is used to supply feedstock and fuel to the Kenai LNG Plant and is also sold to local utilities.   
  In October 2011, we acquired an additional 30 percent interest in the Kenai LNG Plant, bringing our ownership interest to 100 percent. The Kenai LNG
Plant had historically supplied LNG to utility companies in Japan. Due to market conditions, the Kenai Plant was scheduled to be mothballed in the second quarter of 2011; however, we delayed the shutdown in order to ship additional cargoes to Asia,
due to energy shortages caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In November 2011, we idled the plant for future use. We subsequently secured additional third-party gas supplies, and as a result, expect to resume limited LNG exports in the
second half of 2012.

     Exploration        In the February 2008 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Sale 193, we successfully bid and were awarded 10-year-primary-term leases on 98 blocks in the Chukchi Sea. We plan to drill an exploration
well on our Chukchi Sea leasehold in 2014, subject to the outcome of pending litigation challenging Lease Sale 193 and the receipt of required regulatory permits.      In January 2010, we exchanged a 25 percent working interest in 50 of our leases in the Chukchi Sea for cash consideration and additional working interests in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In late 2010, we
entered into an agreement to farm-down an additional 10 percent of our working interest in the same Chukchi Sea leases, and that agreement received regulatory approval in July 2011.        Transportation        We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to
south-central Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 28.3 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok Pipelines on
the North Slope.      Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using
five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering third-party vessels as necessary.      In 2008, ConocoPhillips and BP plc
formed a limited liability company to progress the pipeline project named Denali The Alaska Gas Pipeline. The project was intended to move natural gas from Alaska s North Slope to North American markets. In May 2011, the project was
canceled as a result of insufficient customer transportation commitments to the project.       U.S. Lower 48    
   
      Onshore        Our 2011 onshore production principally consisted of natural gas and associated liquids production, with the majority of production located in the San Juan Basin, Permian Basin, Lobo Trend, Eagle Ford,
Williston Basin, panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma, Fort Worth Basin, Anadarko Basin and Bossier Trend. We also have operations in the Wind River Basin, East Texas, Rockies and northern and southern Louisiana. Onshore activities in 2011 were centered
mostly on continued optimization and development of existing assets, with particular focus on areas with higher liquids production.

Shale Plays           Exploration and development continues in our shale positions in Eagle Ford, Bakken and Barnett. In the Eagle Ford, we drilled approximately 160 exploration and development wells in 2011 and plan to drill
approximately 200 wells in 2012. With subsequent investments, we expect to achieve peak production in 2017 and long-term average production of 140,000 BOED. During 2011, we acquired approximately 240,000 additional acres in various resource plays
across the Lower 48, which included the Avalon, Wolfcamp and Niobrara areas, further expanding our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays.       

San Juan           The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. We continue to pursue development opportunities in
three conventional formations in the San Juan Basin.        Gulf of Mexico        At year-end 2011, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:   

16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.      

16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.      

12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.      
    Exploration        In the Gulf of
Mexico, we have a 45 percent interest in the Coronado well, which was spud in October 2011. A decision to cease drilling the well was made prior to reaching the targeted depth, and the well was expensed as a dry hole. We are in the planning process
to appraise the results of Tiber and Shenandoah, which were discovered in 2009. Additionally, we were the successful bidder on 75 blocks in the Paleogene play in OCS Lease Sale 218 in December 2011. We expect these blocks will be awarded in 2012.
     Offshore south Louisiana, we drilled the Shalimar exploration well. The well did not reach its target depth due to technical drilling issues
and was expensed as a dry hole.      Onshore, we actively pursued the appraisal of our existing unconventional resource plays, including the Eagle
Ford in South Texas, the Bakken in the Williston Basin, and the Barnett in the Fort Worth Basin. We have seen encouraging results in these liquids-rich plays and plan to continue appraisal and development in 2012.   
    Transportation        We have a 25
percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline (REX). The REX natural gas pipeline runs 1,679 miles from Cheyenne, Colorado, to Clarington, Ohio, and has a natural gas transmission capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. Numerous
compression facilities support the pipeline system. The REX pipeline is designed to enable natural gas producers in the Rocky Mountains region to deliver natural gas supplies to the Midwest and eastern regions of the United States. Upon the
completion of the separation of the downstream businesses, we expect REX will be included in the new downstream company, Phillips 66.   
  E P EUROPE      In 2011, E P
operations in Europe contributed 20 percent of E P s worldwide liquids production and 14 percent of natural gas production. Our European assets are principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.

    Norway        
    The Greater Ekofisk Area, located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway in the North Sea, is comprised
of four producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Ekofisk crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Our Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II projects continue to progress, with production from
both of these projects expected in 2013 and 2014, respectively.      The Alvheim development consists of a floating production, storage and
offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the United Kingdom via a pipeline to the Beryl-Sage system.   
  The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is transported to Mongstad in Norway and Tetney in the United Kingdom by
double-hulled shuttle tankers. Part of the natural gas is transported and sold to buyers in Europe, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18.3 percent interest.   
  The Statfjord Field straddles the boundary between the United Kingdom and Norway. In January 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in
the Statfjord Field and associated satellites. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012.      We also have varying
ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea.        Exploration 
      During 2011, we drilled one exploration well, Peking Duck (7/11-12S), including the Agn sidetrack well (7/11-12A). The wells were
non-commercial gas discoveries and were expensed as dry holes. In addition, we participated in two partner-operated wells, Caterpillar (PL340BS) in the Alvheim Area and Arran (PL309) in the Oseberg Area. The Caterpillar discovery is currently being
evaluated. Arran was a dry hole and has been plugged and abandoned.      We were awarded three new licenses in the Norwegian
21   st    Licensing Round: PL603, a 25 percent working interest
in the Norwegian Sea; PL605, a 50 percent operating interest in the Barents Sea; and PL615, a 25 percent working interest in the Barents Sea. We acquired 3D seismic over PL605.        Transportation        We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a
220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a terminal and natural gas processing facility in Teesside, England. In addition, we own a 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled), which owns
most of the Norwegian gas transportation infrastructure.

    United Kingdom        
    In addition to our interest in the Britannia natural gas and condensate field, we own 50 percent of Britannia Operator
Limited, the operator of the field. Condensate is delivered through the Forties Pipeline to an oil stabilization and processing plant near the Grangemouth Refinery in Scotland, while natural gas is transported through Britannia s line to St.
Fergus, Scotland. The Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, produce via subsea manifolds and pipelines linked to the Britannia platform.      J-Block is comprised of the Judy/Joanne, Jade and Jasmine fields, located in the U.K. central North Sea. In 2010, we received government approval for the development of the Jasmine Field, which is
expected to achieve average net peak production of 34,000 BOED by 2013.      We have various ownership interests in 18 producing gas fields in the
Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas of the Southern North Sea. Our interests in the East Irish Sea include the Millom, Dalton and Calder fields, which are operated on our behalf by a third party.   
  We own a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field, located in the Atlantic Margin. The Clair Ridge Project received government approval in October 2011,
and we anticipate initial production in 2016.      In December 2011, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the MacCulloch, Alba
and Nicol fields. The sales of these interests are expected to close in the first half of 2012.        Exploration     
  During 2011, we participated in two partner-operated exploration wells. Well 206/12a-3 in the Clair South West Area, West of Shetlands, was an oil
discovery and has been suspended in order to evaluate development options for the area. The Cameron well (44/19a-7a) in the Southern North Sea was a small gas discovery and is currently being evaluated for commerciality.   
    Transportation        We have a 10
percent interest in the Interconnector Pipeline, which links the United Kingdom and Belgium and facilitates the marketing throughout Europe of natural gas produced in the United Kingdom. We have export capability to ship up to 220 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day to markets in continental Europe via the Interconnector, and our reverse-flow rights provide 85 million cubic feet per day of import capability into the United Kingdom.   
  We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals in which we have 29.3 percent and 50 percent ownership interests, respectively. We
also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party, in the United Kingdom.

    Poland         Exploration        We are participating in a shale gas venture in Poland, which provides
us with the option to earn a 70 percent operating interest in six exploration licenses in the Baltic Basin. We participated in two wells in 2011.      E P CANADA      In 2011, E P operations in Canada contributed 12 percent of
E P s worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of E P s worldwide natural gas production.       
      Western Canada        Our operations in western Canada are primarily comprised of three core development areas: Deep Basin, Kaybob and O Chiese, which extend from central Alberta to northeastern British Columbia. We
operate or have ownership interests in approximately 80 natural gas processing plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2011, held leasehold rights in 6 million net acres in western Canada.   
    Oil Sands        We hold approximately
1 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into
the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.       

Surmont               The Surmont oil sands lease is located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont Phase II construction began in 2010, with production startup targeted for 2015. Surmont s net
production is expected to increase to 50,000 barrels per day by 2016.       

FCCL           We have two 50/50 North American heavy oil business ventures with Cenovus Energy Inc.: FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, and WRB Refining LP, a U.S. downstream limited
partnership. FCCL s assets, operated by Cenovus, include the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen projects.      Construction continued in 2011 on Foster Creek Phase F, the first of three additional approved expansion phases. Upon completion of Foster Creek Phases F, G and H, net peak production is anticipated to
increase by 42,500 barrels per day beginning in 2014. At Christina Lake, first production for Phase C occurred in the third quarter of 2011. Construction of Christina Lake Phase D continued through 2011, with initial production expected in late
2012. Once phases C and D are both fully operational, net peak production at Christina Lake is estimated to be 47,000 barrels per day. Christina Lake Phases E, F and G received regulatory approval in the second quarter of 2011, and construction on
Phase E commenced in the third quarter of 2011.

Narrows Lake is an emerging opportunity within the FCCL Partnership. A regulatory application for the development of Narrows Lake was submitted in June 2010, and we anticipate receiving a
response in the second quarter of 2012. Initial production is anticipated in 2017.      For information on WRB, see the
 Refining and Marketing (R M)  section.        Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project     
  We are involved with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers  Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley
Pipeline and gathering system, which is proposed to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake natural gas field, one of the
primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta, which would anchor the pipeline development. In March 2011, the project received regulatory approval from the National Energy Board of Canada. However, due to a continued decline in market conditions and lack
of resolution with the Canadian government on fiscal terms, we are currently evaluating multiple options regarding the scope and timing of this project. Should the project not proceed, we would need to assess for impairment the carrying value of the
undeveloped leasehold and capitalized project development costs, which totaled $662 million at December 31, 2011, including capitalized interest.        Amauligak        We have a 53.8 percent operating interest in Amauligak, which lies
approximately 31 miles offshore in shallow water in the Beaufort Sea. A range of development options are being evaluated.   
    Exploration        We hold exploration
acreage in four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, onshore western Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands. During 2011, we conducted pilot drilling programs in the Muskwa (Horn River Basin) and Duvernay
(West Shale Basin) unconventional resource plays, and we acquired approximately 260,000 acres of exploration leasehold in the Canol Shale, Duvernay Shale and other plays.      E P SOUTH AMERICA       Venezuela    
  In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an  empresa mixta  structure mandated by the Venezuelan
government s Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela s national oil company, Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips  interests in the Petrozuata and
Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we are currently awaiting an interim decision on key legal and factual issues. A separate arbitration hearing was held in January
2012 before the International Chamber of Commerce on ConocoPhillips  separate claims against PDVSA for certain breaches of their Association Agreements prior to the expropriation.       Ecuador       In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,
initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID,
Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil. In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal
concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011. On September 30, 2011, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe will
not be material. The arbitration process is ongoing.

      Australia Pacific LNG        Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia.
Origin operates APLNG s production and pipeline system, and we will operate the LNG facility. Natural gas is currently sold to domestic customers, while progress continues on the development of an LNG processing and export sales business. Once
established, this will enhance our LNG position and serve as an additional LNG hub supplying Asia Pacific markets. Two initial 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG trains are anticipated, with over 10,000 net wells ultimately envisioned to supply both
the domestic gas market and the LNG development. The additional wells will be supported by expanded gas gathering systems, centralized gas processing and compression stations, and water treatment facilities, in addition to a new export pipeline from
the gas fields to the LNG facilities.      The project received environmental approval from the Australian federal government in February 2011,
and a final investment decision on the initial LNG train and common facilities was approved in July 2011. The project s first LNG exports are expected to begin in 2015.      In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec
subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin Energy s ownership interest diluting from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011.   
  In November 2011, APLNG signed a binding Heads of Agreement with Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc., for the sale of approximately 1 million
tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Kansai Electric will be supplied LNG beginning in mid-2016. The agreement is subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train, which is expected in the first half
of 2012.

   In January 2012, APLNG and Sinopec signed an amendment to their existing LNG sales agreement for the sale
and purchase of an additional 3.3 million tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train. This agreement, in combination with the Kansai Electric agreement, finalizes the marketing of the
second train. In conjunction with the LNG sale, the parties have also agreed for Sinopec to subscribe for additional shares in APLNG, which would raise its equity interest from 15 percent to 25 percent. As a result, both our ownership interest
and Origin Energy s ownership interest would dilute from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. These agreements are subject to customary government approvals.      For additional information, see Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

petroleum development area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin. Produced natural gas is used to supply the Darwin LNG Plant. In
2011, we sold 153 billion gross cubic feet of LNG to utility customers in Japan.        Athena/Perseus     
  The Athena production license (WA-17-L) is located offshore Western Australia and contains part of the Perseus Field which straddles the boundary with
WA-1-L, an adjoining license area. Natural gas is produced from these licenses.        Greater Sunrise     
  We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. Although the governments of Australia and
Timor-Leste have reached an agreement concerning sharing of revenues from the anticipated development of Greater Sunrise, key challenges must be resolved before significant funding commitments can be made. These include gaining both
governments  approval of the development concept selected by the co-venturers.        Exploration     
  We operate three permits located in the Browse Basin, offshore northwest Australia. We own a 60 percent interest in two of the permits, WA-315-P and
WA-398-P. In February 2012, we received regulatory approval to reduce our interest in the third permit, WA-314-P, from 60 percent to 10 percent. The first phase of drilling in 2009/2010 resulted in discoveries in WA-315-P and WA-398-P. In 2011,
we completed the analysis of the 3-D seismic survey acquired during the 2009/2010 drilling campaign. The Phase II drilling campaign will commence in the first quarter of 2012 and will comprise a five- to eight-well program.   
  During 2011, we executed an option agreement to earn up to a 75 percent working interest in the Goldwyer Shale Project located in the Canning Basin
of Western Australia. Drilling is expected to commence in 2012. Upon completion of the initial drilling program, we will have the right to assume operatorship of the Goldwyer Shale Project. The agreement is awaiting regulatory approvals.   
  In the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, we operate and own a 60 percent interest in two permits, NT/P69 and NT/P61. During 2011, we
reprocessed the seismic data over the Caldita structure in NT/P61, which will allow us to fully evaluate the remaining exploration potential of the permit.

   On July 13, 2011, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) in the People s Republic of China
instructed us to suspend production from the Peng Lai 19-3 Field Platforms B and C, as a result of two separate seepage incidents which occurred near the platforms. On September 2, 2011, the SOA ordered us to halt operations at the Peng Lai
19-3 Field, pending additional cleanup efforts and reservoir depressurization activities to ensure any residual seepage had stopped. The incidents resulted in a total release of approximately 700 barrels of oil into Bohai Bay and approximately
2,600 barrels of mineral oil-based drilling mud onto the seafloor. The mineral oil-based drilling mud was recovered and cleaned up from the seafloor. The sources of the seeps have been sealed and containment devices deployed as a preventative
measure to capture any residue.      The SOA also required implementation of preventative measures to avoid recurrence, in addition to the filing
of an updated environmental impact assessment and development plan for approval. A revised development plan was submitted to China s National Development and Reform Commission in November 2011 and is currently under review. A revised
environmental impact assessment was submitted to the SOA in February 2012.      The approved depressurization plan, combined with limited
development and field optimization, reduced 2011 average daily net production from the field by 14,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to 2010 production levels. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.   
  In January 2012, we and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced an agreement with China s Ministry of Agriculture to resolve
fishery-related issues in connection with the seepage incidents. Under this agreement, approximately $160 million will be paid as compensation to settle private claims of potentially affected fishermen in relevant Bohai Bay communities, and public
claims for alleged fishery damage. We hold a 49 percent ownership interest in the Peng Lai fields. The agreement fulfills the objectives of the compensation fund we announced in September 2011. As part of this agreement, we have also designated
approximately $16 million of our previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources and for related projects.   
  The Panyu development, also located in the South China Sea, is comprised of three oil fields: Panyu 4-2, Panyu 5-1 and Panyu 11-6. An expansion of the
scope and capacity of the existing Panyu 4-2 and Panyu 5-1 fields is being undertaken, with the addition of two production platforms targeted for completion in 2013.       Vietnam        
    Our ownership interest in Vietnam is centered around the Cuu Long Basin in the South China Sea and consists of two
primarily oil-producing blocks and one gas pipeline transportation system.      Our activities in Block 15-1 are focused around three producing

     We were formally awarded Block 7011/11, Qamut, in December 2010 for oil and gas exploration in Baffin Bay, offshore Greenland. We own a
61.3 percent operating interest in the Qamut license. The work program, including 2-D seismic acquisitions, commenced in 2011.       Spill
Containment           Marine Well Containment Company          In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response
in the Gulf of Mexico. Since its formation, several companies have joined the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC).      In February 2011, MWCC
launched an interim containment system, which provides rapid containment response capabilities in the event of an underwater well control incident in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. MWCC is advancing this capability and is currently developing an
expanded containment system with significantly increased capacity. The expanded containment system is expected to be available in 2012.   
    Subsea Well Response Project     
  During 2011, we, along with eight leading oil and gas companies, launched the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP), an initiative designed to enhance the
industry s capability to respond to international subsea well control incidents. SWRP is a non-profit organization based in Stavanger, Norway. This project complements the work being undertaken in the United States by MWCC and also in the
United Kingdom by the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group (OSPRAG). We are also a participant in OSPRAG.       Freeport LNG
      We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at
Freeport s 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets; therefore, our near- to mid-term utilization of the Freeport Terminal is
expected to be limited. We are responsible for monthly process-or-pay payments to Freeport irrespective of whether we utilize the terminal for regasification. The financial impact of this capacity underutilization is not expected to be material to
our future earnings or cash flows.

         LUKOIL INVESTMENT        This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in
the first quarter of 2011. See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.          CHEMICALS        At December 31, 2011, our Chemicals
segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips  total assets. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, a joint venture with Chevron Corporation, headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas. Upon completion of the
separation of the downstream businesses, we expect our investment in the Chemicals segment will be included in Phillips 66.      CPChem s
business is structured around two primary operating segments: Olefins   Polyolefins (O P) and Specialties, Aromatics   Styrenics (SA S). The O P segment produces and markets ethylene, propylene, and other olefin
products, which are primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins, polypropylene and polyethylene pipe. The SA S segment manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as benzene, styrene,
paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers. SA S also manufactures and markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, drilling chemicals, mining chemicals and
high-performance engineering plastics and compounds.

   CPChem s manufacturing facilities are located in Belgium, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Korea and the United States.       Key Projects       In October 2010, CPChem announced plans to build a 1-hexene plant capable of producing in excess of 200,000 metric tons per year at its Cedar Bayou Chemical Complex in Baytown, Texas. 1-hexene is a
critical component used in the manufacture of polyethylene, a plastic resin commonly converted into film, plastic pipe, milk jugs, detergent bottles and food and beverage containers. Project planning has begun, with startup anticipated in 2014.
     In November 2011, CPChem completed the acquisition of a polyalphaolefins (PAO) plant located in Beringen, Belgium. The addition of the plant
more than doubled CPChem s PAO production capability. PAOs are used in many synthetic products, such as lubricants, greases and fluids, and have emerged as essential components in many industries and applications.   
  In December 2011, CPChem announced plans to pursue a project to construct a world-scale ethane cracker and two polyethylene facilities in the U.S. Gulf
Coast Region. The project would leverage the development of significant shale gas resources in the United States. CPChem s Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas, would be the location of the 1.5-million-metric-tons-per-year ethylene unit. The
two polyethylene facilities, each with an annual capacity of 500,000 metric tons, would be located at either the Cedar Bayou facility, or near CPChem s Sweeny facility in Old Ocean, Texas. Further evaluation will occur during 2012, with a final
investment decision expected in 2013.      CPChem owns a 49 percent interest in Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), a joint venture that owns a
major olefins and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar. CPChem also owns a 49 percent interest in Qatar Chemical Company II Ltd. (Q-Chem II), an additional joint venture in Mesaieed. The Q-Chem II facility produces polyethylene and normal alpha
olefins (NAO) on a site adjacent to the Q-Chem complex. In connection with this project, an ethane cracker that provides ethylene feedstock via pipeline to the Q-Chem II plants was developed in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. The ethane cracker
and pipeline are owned by Ras Laffan Olefins Company, a joint venture of Q-Chem II and Qatofin Company Limited. Q-Chem II s interests in the ethane cracker, pipeline and polyethylene and NAO plants are collectively referred to as Q-Chem
II. Operational startup of Q-Chem II occurred in 2010.      Saudi Chevron Phillips Company (SCP) is a 50-percent-owned joint venture of CPChem
that owns and operates an aromatics complex at Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. Jubail Chevron Phillips Company (JCP), another 50-percent-owned joint venture of CPChem, owns and operates an integrated styrene facility adjacent to the SCP
aromatics complex. SCP and JCP are collectively known as S-Chem.      In December 2011, Saudi Polymers Company (SPCo), a 35-percent-owned joint
venture company of CPChem, completed the construction of an integrated petrochemicals complex at Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. SPCo will produce ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and 1-hexene. Commercial
production is expected in 2012.          EMERGING BUSINESSES     
  At December 31, 2011, our Emerging Businesses segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips  total assets. The segment encompasses the
development of new technologies and businesses outside our normal operations. Activities within this segment are focused on power generation and new technologies related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative
energy, biofuels and the environment. Upon completion of the separation of the downstream businesses, we expect our power generation assets and certain technology operations will be included in Phillips 66.   
         28

     Power Generation        The focus of our power business is on developing projects to support our E P and R M strategies. While projects primarily in place to enable these strategies are included within their respective
segments, the following projects have a significant merchant component and are included in the Emerging Businesses segment:       

The Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant, a wholly owned 1,180-megawatt facility in the United Kingdom, which provides steam and electricity to the
Humber Refinery and steam to a neighboring refinery, as well as merchant power into the U.K. market.      

Sweeny Cogeneration LP, our 50 percent joint venture near the Sweeny Refinery complex.      
    Technology Development        Our
Technology group focuses on developing new business opportunities designed to provide future growth prospects for ConocoPhillips. Focus areas include advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy efficiency technologies, new petroleum-based products,
renewable fuels and carbon capture and conversion technologies. We are progressing the technology development of second-generation biofuels with Iowa State University, the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels and Archer Daniels Midland. We
have also established a relationship with the University of Texas Energy Institute to collaborate on emerging technologies. Internally, we are continuing to evaluate wind, solar and geothermal investment opportunities. We also invest in technologies
to find more efficient, economical and environmentally sound ways to produce oil and natural gas by focusing on our oil sands position, the rapid growth from unconventional reservoirs and advances in subsurface technologies.   
  In 2011, we formed Energy Technology Ventures (ETV), a joint venture with General Electric Capital and NRG Energy, Inc., which focuses on the development
of next generation energy technology. ETV invests in, and offers commercial collaboration opportunities to, venture- and growth-stage energy technology companies in the renewable power generation, smart grid, energy efficiency, oil, natural gas,
coal and nuclear energy, emission controls and biofuels sectors.      In addition, we operate a Global Water Sustainability Center in Qatar, which
researches and develops water solutions for the petroleum, petrochemical, municipal and agricultural sectors.      We offer a gasification
technology (E-Gas  Technology) that uses petroleum coke, coal, and other low-value hydrocarbons as feedstock, resulting in high-value synthesis gas used for a slate of products, including power, substitute natural gas, hydrogen and chemicals.
This clean, efficient technology facilitates carbon capture and storage, as well as minimizes criteria pollutant emissions and reduces water consumption. E-Gas  Technology has been utilized in commercial applications since 1987 and is currently
licensed to third parties. We have licensed E-Gas  Technology in Asia and North America, and are pursuing several additional licensing opportunities.         COMPETITION       We compete with private, public and state-owned
companies in all facets of the petroleum and chemicals businesses. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our segments is highly competitive. No single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominates any of our
business lines.      Our E P segment competes with numerous other companies in the industry, including state-owned companies, to locate and
obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on publicly available year-end 2010 reserves statistics, we had the seventh-largest total of worldwide proved
reserves of nongovernment-controlled companies. We deliver our production into the worldwide commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise;
economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and operating efficient oil and gas producing properties.   
         29

   The Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DCP Midstream and our consolidated operations,
competes with numerous other integrated petroleum companies, as well as natural gas transmission and distribution companies, to deliver components of natural gas to end users in the commodity natural gas markets. DCP Midstream is a large extractor
of natural gas liquids in the United States.      Principal methods of competing include economically securing the right to purchase raw natural
gas into gathering systems, managing the pressure of those systems, operating efficient natural gas liquids processing plants and securing markets for the products produced.      Our R M segment competes primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia. Based on the statistics published in the December 5, 2011, issue of the  Oil   Gas Journal , we are one of
the largest refiners of petroleum products in the United States. Worldwide, our refining capacity ranked in the top ten among nongovernment-controlled companies. In the Chemicals segment, CPChem generally ranked within the top 10 producers of
many of its major product lines, based on average 2011 production capacity, as published by industry sources. Petroleum products, petrochemicals and plastics are delivered into the worldwide commodity markets. Elements of competition for both our
R M and Chemicals segments include product improvement, new product development, low-cost structures, and efficient manufacturing and distribution systems. In the marketing portion of the business, competitive factors include product properties
and processibility, reliability of supply, customer service, price and credit terms, advertising and sales promotion, and development of customer loyalty to ConocoPhillips  or CPChem s branded products.   
     GENERAL       At
the end of 2011, we held a total of 1,229 active patents in 63 countries worldwide, including 525 active U.S. patents. During 2011, we received 52 patents in the United States and 70 foreign patents. Our products and processes generated licensing
revenues of $136 million in 2011. The overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession.      Company-sponsored research and development activities charged against earnings were $267 million, $230 million and $190 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   
  Our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure consistent
health, safety and environmental excellence. In support of the goal of zero incidents, we have implemented an HSE Excellence process, which enables business units to measure their performance and compliance with our HSE Management System
requirements, identify gaps, and develop improvement plans. Assessments are conducted annually to capture progress and set new targets. We are also committed to continuously improving process safety and preventing releases of hazardous materials.

      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS    
  You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these
risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.        Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining margins.     
  Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural
gas liquids, LNG and refined products. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products prices may reduce the amount of these commodities we can produce
economically, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows.        Unless we successfully add to
our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen and natural gas production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.        The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering
studies, identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil and natural gas. Accordingly, to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil, bitumen and natural gas we
produce with good prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations.        Any
material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.       Our proved reserve information included in this annual report has been derived from engineering estimates prepared or reviewed by our personnel. Any significant future price changes could have a material
effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be
recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may
produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume
of reserves reported.        We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance
with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Likewise, future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.     
  Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to
increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:       

The discharge of pollutants into the environment.      

Emissions into the atmosphere (such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions as they are, or may become,
regulated).      

The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and clean up of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.

The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.      

Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and shale gas plays.
     
         31

   We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation
expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.      Although our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate
expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the Earth s climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased
expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products could fall.      In addition, in response to the Deepwater
Horizon incident, the United States, as well as other countries where we do business, may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business.   
    Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.
       Actions of the U.S., state and local governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could
reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our
ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan
government, and may continue to do so in the future.      Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material
adverse effect on us. Approximately 60 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the United States in 2011, and 56 percent of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2011, was located outside the United States.
We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and taxation, other
political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations.        Changes in
governmental regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas.        Our
operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas wells below actual
production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.   
    Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.        We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture participants. There is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic,
business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.
Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our
joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.   
         32

     We do not insure against all potential losses; and therefore, we could be harmed by unexpected
liabilities and increased costs.        We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from
operating risks. As such, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for
capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.        Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.        The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, pipeline interruptions, pipeline ruptures,
crude oil or refined products spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, or cyber attacks. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. All
such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation.   
    The proposed separation of our downstream businesses is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, which may not be consummated on
the terms or timeline currently contemplated or may not achieve the intended results.        We expect the separation will be effective in
the second quarter of 2012. Our ability to timely effect the separation is subject to several conditions, including, among others, the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and the SEC declaring effective a registration statement
relating to the securities of Phillips 66. We cannot assure we will be able to complete the separation in a timely fashion, if at all. For these and other reasons, the separation may not be completed on the terms or timeline contemplated. Further,
if the separation is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. Any such difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.         Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS       None.   
     Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters that arose during the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as matters previously reported in our 2010 Form 10-K and our   
  first-, second- and third-quarter 2011 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to the fourth quarter of 2011. Material developments to the previously
reported matters have been included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings was decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, we expect
there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to SEC regulations.      Our U.S. refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees, regarding alleged violations of the Federal Clean Air Act, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), six states and one local air
pollution agency. Some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees provide for stipulated penalties for violations. Stipulated penalties under the decrees are not automatic, but must be requested by one of the agency signatories. As
part of periodic reports under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations, we occasionally report matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties. If a specific request for stipulated penalties meeting the
reporting threshold set forth in SEC rules is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance, we will separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty.

     New Matters        In December 2011, ConocoPhillips was notified by the EPA of alleged violations related to the use of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). The EPA intends to present an administrative settlement
agreement to resolve the alleged violations under which it would seek a penalty of $250,000. ConocoPhillips is working with the EPA to resolve this matter.      On November 28, 2011, the Borger Refinery received a Notice of Enforcement from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for alleged emissions events that occurred during inclement
weather in January and February 2011. The TCEQ is seeking a penalty of $120,000. ConocoPhillips is working with TCEQ to resolve this matter.   
  In October 2011, ConocoPhillips was notified by the Attorney General of the State of California it was conducting an investigation into possible
violations of the regulations relating to the operation of underground storage tanks at gas stations in California. ConocoPhillips is contesting these allegations.        Matters Previously Reported        On April 13, 2011, ConocoPhillips received a
Notice of Enforcement and Proposed Agreed Order from the TCEQ seeking a penalty to settle several violations of air pollution control regulations and/or facility permit conditions at the Borger Refinery. These violations were previously disclosed on
the ConocoPhillips Borger Refinery Title V deviation report. The TCEQ approved the settlement of this matter on October 18, 2011, with payment of a $70,963 penalty and a $70,962 Supplemental Environmental Project. This matter is now resolved.
     In October 2007, we received a Complaint from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Water Act related to a 2006 oil spill at our Bayway
Refinery and proposing a penalty of $156,000. ConocoPhillips is working with the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to resolve this matter.      In
2009, ConocoPhillips notified the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) it had self-identified certain compliance issues related to Benzene Waste Operations National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants requirements at its Trainer,
Pennsylvania, and Borger, Texas, facilities. On January 6, 2010, the DOJ provided its initial penalty demand for this matter as part of our confidential settlement negotiations. ConocoPhillips has reached an agreement with the EPA and DOJ
regarding an appropriate penalty amount, which will be reflected in the third amendment to the consent decree in Civil Action No. H-05-258 (the agreed-upon penalty amount remains confidential until that time).   
  On May 19, 2010, the Lake Charles Louisiana Refinery received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) alleging various violations of applicable air emission regulations, as well as certain provisions of the consent decree in Civil Action No. H-01-4430. ConocoPhillips is working with the LDEQ to resolve this
matter.      In October 2003, the District Attorney s Office in Sacramento, California, filed a complaint in California Superior Court for
alleged methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) contamination in groundwater. On April 4, 2008, the District Attorney s Office filed an amended complaint that included alleged violations of state regulations relating to operation or maintenance
of underground storage tanks. There are numerous defendants named in the suit in addition to ConocoPhillips. On December 19, 2011, the Court approved a settlement of this lawsuit which includes the payment of $500,000 which will be treated as a
civil penalty. This matter is now resolved.         Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

 earnings  and  loss  as used in Management s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips.        BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW       ConocoPhillips is an international,
integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 29,800 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2011 had assets of $153 billion. Our stock is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  COP.       Our business is organized into six operating segments:   

Exploration and Production (E P)  This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas,
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.      

Midstream  This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets
natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.      

Refining and Marketing (R M)  This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the
United States, Europe and Asia.      

LUKOIL Investment  This segment consists of our past investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil
and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.      

Chemicals  This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50
percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).      

Emerging Businesses  This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations.

   Our earnings depend largely on the profitability of our E P and R M segments. Crude oil and natural
gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors affecting our profitability. In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced extreme volatility. As a result, in late 2009, we announced
several strategic initiatives designed to improve our financial position and increase returns on capital. We have made significant progress on our three-year strategic plan through portfolio optimization, debt reduction and increased shareholder
distributions. During 2011, we announced plans to sell an additional $5 $10 billion of noncore assets over the next two years, bringing the total asset divestiture program target to $15 $20 billion for the years 2010 through 2012. As of
year-end 2011, we have generated approximately $10.7 billion from asset dispositions, the proceeds of which were primarily targeted toward share repurchases and debt reduction.      We also completed the sale of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011, which generated total proceeds of $9.5 billion in 2010 and 2011. These proceeds were largely used to fund share
repurchases. In December 2011, our Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the next two years. This increased the share repurchase program from $15 billion to $25 billion. Since the inception of
the share repurchase programs, we have repurchased 15 percent of our shares outstanding for a total of $15 billion. During 2011, we also increased the amount of our quarterly dividend rate by 20 percent, paid dividends on our common stock of
$3.6 billion for the full year and reduced our debt by 4 percent.      Our total capital program in 2012 is expected to be $15.5 billion, a
$1.5 billion increase from $14.0 billion in 2011. We also expect 2012 production to be approximately 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), excluding the impact of any additional asset sales.   
  Consistent with our strategy to focus on value creation for our shareholders, in July 2011, our Board approved pursuing the separation of our refining,
marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as
our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment. We believe the separation will enable each company to pursue a more focused strategy, which will enable the management of each company to concentrate
their resources on its particular market segments, customers and core businesses. The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final
Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012.      Upon completion of the separation, ConocoPhillips will be a
large and geographically diverse pure-play exploration and production company. Our strategy of enhancing returns on capital through developing new resources, growing reserves and production per share, continuing the asset sale program and increasing
shareholder distributions will not change.      Phillips 66 will be an integrated downstream company, with operations encompassing natural gas
gathering and processing, crude oil refining, petroleum products marketing, transportation, power generation and petrochemicals manufacturing and marketing.      We believe the execution of our strategic plan will position the two companies to be successful and competitive in the long term. Other important factors that we must continue to manage well in order to
sustain our long-term competitive position include:       

Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner.  Safety is
our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing
fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins.         During 2011,
our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent, compared with 81 percent in 2010. The increase in 2011 primarily resulted from the removal of the Wilhelmshaven Refinery (WRG) from our refining capacities effective
January 1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned maintenance.   
         40

   There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result
of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well
Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work
internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom.   

Adding to our proved reserve base.  We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:      

o  
  Successful exploration and development of new fields.     

o  
  Acquisition of existing fields.     

o  
  Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.     
  Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and
proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 102 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and expropriations.
     Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while
fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation
may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.   

Controlling costs and expenses.  Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs,
within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit
basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 1 percent in 2011,
compared with 2010.          

Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars.  We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must
often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, construct pipelines and LNG facilities, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest
in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial
returns.         The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $13.3 billion in
2011, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $14.8 billion in 2012. The increase reflects our strategic emphasis on delivering value by investing in the most profitable opportunities. We expect competitive returns
from increased investments in unconventional resource projects, such as our oil sands business in Canada, liquids-rich shale plays in the U.S. Lower 48 and the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) joint venture. As our production profile adjusts over time
to reflect our increased levels of investment in liquids plays and lower levels in North American conventional natural gas, we expect higher returns in E P, absent changes in market factors.   

Managing our asset portfolio.  We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic plans or should be sold or
otherwise disposed. As part of our $15 $20 billion asset divestiture program for 2010 2012, during 2010, we sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil      
         41   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

sands mining operation; our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties, a joint venture which owned and operated  Flying J -branded truck and travel plazas; and several E P properties located
in the Lower 48 and western Canada. In 2011, we continued to divest low-return, noncore assets in the Lower 48 and western Canada. We also sold WRG, Seaway Products Pipeline Company, and our equity interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway
Crude Pipeline Company. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.         East Coast refining has been under severe market pressure for several years. As a result, in September 2011, we announced our intention to sell the Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, Pennsylvania.
The refinery has been idled and will permanently close by the end of the first quarter of 2012 if a sales transaction is unsuccessful. In addition, in E P we recently entered into agreements to sell our Vietnam business, as well as certain North
Sea assets. These sales are expected to close in the first half of 2012.       

Developing and retaining a talented work force.  We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to
implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development
programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills.         Other significant factors that can affect our
profitability include:       

Commodity prices . In 2011, the global economic rate of growth slowed, leading to lower oil demand growth. Oil prices, however, increased in
2011, as supply concerns, including concerns over the loss of Libyan production, outweighed the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe. U.S. natural gas prices remained under pressure during 2011, as increased production from shale
plays outpaced demand growth. As a result, storage inventory levels reached record highs by the end of 2011. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices, resulting in limited U.S. LNG imports in the near- to mid-term.
        In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased
industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short- and long-term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also
have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; cancelation or delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope and Canadian
Arctic natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities and certain natural gas pipelines. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible.   

Impairments.  As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when, for example,
our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of
money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2011 totaled $1.3 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Trainer
Refinery, our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG) and certain Canadian natural gas properties. Before-tax impairments in 2010 totaled $2.4 billion and primarily related to the $1.5 billion property impairment of WRG and the
$0.6 billion impairment of our equity investment in NMNG.          

Effective tax rate . Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable
commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the  mix  of pretax earnings within our global operations.      
         42   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

Fiscal and regulatory environment  .  Our operations, primarily in E P, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political
environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted
our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were temporarily suspended in 2011 during Libya s period of
civil unrest. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our
management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries.      
    Segment Analysis        Earnings for
the E P segment are generally closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry
crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2011, compared with 2010, averaging $95.05 per barrel in 2011, an increase of 20 percent. Industry natural gas prices at Henry Hub decreased 8 percent during 2011 to an average
price of $4.04 per million British thermal units.      The Midstream segment s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices.
The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream s natural gas liquids prices increased 23 percent in 2011.   
  Refining margins, refinery capacity utilization and cost control primarily drive the R M segment s results. Refining margins are subject to
movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins significantly improved during 2011, compared with
2010. The U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread, which is primarily WTI-based, increased 126 percent in 2011, while the N.W. Europe benchmark increased 20 percent. The improvement in domestic refining margins primarily resulted from increased production from
shale plays and high inventory levels in the Midcontinent area, causing WTI to trade at a deeper discount relative to waterborne crudes for most of 2011. This discount, however, began to narrow toward the end of 2011. During the periods of large
WTI-Brent spreads, refineries capable of processing WTI and crude oils that are WTI-based benefitted from the lower regional feedstock prices. In contrast, East Coast refining, which relies primarily on Brent-based crudes, has been under severe
market pressure. Product imports, weakness in motor fuel demand, and costly regulatory requirements are key challenges in this difficult environment.      The LUKOIL Investment segment consisted of our prior investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. We disposed of our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.   
  The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the
margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia.   
  The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within
this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these
technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years.      Our key performance indicators are shown in the
statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include commodity prices, production and refining capacity utilization.

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Consolidated Results       A summary of the company s net income attributable to
ConocoPhillips by business segment follows:       
     2011 vs. 2010       Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 9 percent in 2011. The improvement was mainly due to:       

Higher commodity prices in our E P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes.

Improved results from our R M operations, reflecting significantly higher U.S. refining margins.      
    These items were partially offset by:       

The absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest.      

Lower production volumes from our E P segment.          2010 vs. 2009       The improved results in 2010 were primarily the result of:   

Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL) and LNG in our E P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by
increased production taxes.      

Gains of $4,583 million after-tax from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales.      

Improved results from our domestic R M operations, reflecting higher refining margins.      
  These items were partially offset by:       

Lower production volumes from our E P segment.

    Income Statement Analysis        2011 vs. 2010        Sales and other operating revenues  increased 29 percent in 2011,
while  purchased crude oil, natural gas and products  increased 37 percent. The increases were mainly due to significantly higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGLs.       Equity in earnings of affiliates  increased 30 percent in 2011. The increase primarily resulted from:       

Earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), primarily due to sales of LNG following production startup, which occurred in October
2010.      

Improved earnings from WRB Refining LP, primarily due to higher refining margins.      

Improved earnings from CPChem, mainly due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line.      

Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment, and 2010 equity earnings included a
$645 million impairment.      

Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership, mostly due to higher commodity prices and volumes.      

Improved earnings from DCP Midstream, LLC, mainly as a result of higher NGL prices.      
  These increases were partially offset by the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest.   
   Gain on dispositions  decreased 65 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of Seaway Products Pipeline Company, our
interests in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, certain E P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the remaining divestiture of our LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our
equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent and the loss on disposition of WRG. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878 million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the
divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. For additional information, see Note 5 Assets Held
for Sale or Sold and Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   
   Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A)  decreased 12 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with our E P segment,
reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit-of-production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011.       Impairments  decreased 56
percent in 2011, primarily due to the $1,514 million impairment of WRG in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by the impairment of the Trainer Refinery and various North American E P natural gas properties in 2011. For additional
information, see Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.       Taxes other than income taxes  increased
9 percent in 2011, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales.       Interest and debt expense  decreased 18 percent in 2011, primarily due to lower debt levels.      See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our  provision for income taxes  and effective tax rate.

    2010 vs. 2009        Sales and other operating revenues  increased 27 percent in 2010, while  purchased crude oil, natural gas and products  increased 33 percent. These increases were primarily due to higher prices
for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG.       Equity in earnings of affiliates  increased 24 percent in
2010. The increase primarily resulted from:       

Improved earnings from CPChem primarily due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line.      

Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher commodity prices and volumes.      

Improved earnings from Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) as a result of improved margins and volumes.      
  These increases were partially offset by a $645 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG.   
   Gain on dispositions  increased $5,643 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the $2,878 million gain realized from the Syncrude
sale, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties.   
   Impairments  increased $1,245 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the 2010 WRG impairment.   
   Taxes other than income taxes  increased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and
higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales.       Interest and debt expense  decreased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to lower debt
levels.      See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our  provision for
income taxes  and effective tax rate.

    2011 vs. 2010       Earnings from our E P segment were $8,242 million in 2011, a 10 percent decrease compared with earnings of $9,198 million in 2010. See the  Business Environment and Executive Overview 
section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices.        U.S. E P     
  U.S. E P earnings were $3,254 million in 2011, an 18 percent increase compared with earnings of $2,768 million in 2010. The increase primarily
resulted from higher crude oil and NGL prices, and, to a lesser extent, lower DD A. These increases were partially offset by higher production taxes, mainly in Alaska, lower sales volumes, higher operating expenses and lower gains from asset
sales in the Lower 48.      U.S. E P production averaged 653,000 BOED in 2011, a decrease of 5 percent from 686,000 BOED in 2010. The
decrease was primarily due to field decline and asset dispositions, which was partially offset by new production, mostly from the Lower 48.   
    International E P     
  International E P earnings were $4,988 million in 2011, a 22 percent decrease compared with earnings of $6,430 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011
included $316 million in additional income tax expense, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in July 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210
million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. In 2011, earnings also included impairments of our investment in NMNG and various natural gas properties located
in Canada, in addition to a $279 million loss on the dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Earnings in 2010 included gains from the sale of Syncrude and certain Canadian properties and an impairment of NMNG.
Excluding the impact from these items, earnings increased in 2011, primarily due to higher prices, a full year of LNG sales from QG3 and lower DD A. These increases to earnings were partially offset by lower volumes and higher taxes.   
  International E P production averaged 966,000 BOED in 2011, a decrease of 9 percent from 1,066,000 BOED in 2010. The decrease
primarily resulted from suspended operations in Libya and in Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production.       2010 vs. 2009       Earnings from our E P segment were $9,198 million in 2010, compared
with earnings of $3,604 million in 2009.        U.S. E P        U.S. E P earnings increased 84 percent in 2010, from $1,503 million in 2009 to $2,768 million in 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs.
Earnings also benefitted from higher gains from asset sales in our Lower 48 portfolio and lower DD A. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes, higher production taxes, primarily in Alaska, and an
unfavorable tax ruling.      U.S. E P production averaged 686,000 BOED in 2010, a decrease of 9 percent from 755,000 BOED in 2009. The
decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime, which was somewhat offset by new production.

     International E P        International E P earnings were $6,430 million in 2010, compared with $2,101 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was mostly due to gains from the sale of Syncrude and other assets and higher crude
oil, natural gas and LNG prices. These increases were partially offset by the NMNG impairment, lower synthetic oil and natural gas volumes, higher petroleum taxes as a result of higher prices and an $81 million after-tax charge to exploration
expenses for project costs resulting from our decision to end participation in the Shah Gas Field Project in Abu Dhabi.      International E P
production averaged 1,066,000 BOED in 2010, a decrease of 3 percent from 1,099,000 BOED in 2009. The decrease was largely due to field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of Syncrude.
These decreases were partially offset by production from major projects, primarily in China, Canada, Qatar and Australia.       Midstream
       
       *Includes our share of equity affiliates.        **Excludes DCP Midstream.       The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers
and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract NGLs from the raw gas stream. The remaining  residue  gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial
users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the NGLs are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or refinery blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of
our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and NGL fractionation, trading and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad.   
   2011 vs. 2010       Earnings from the
Midstream segment increased 50 percent in 2011, reflecting higher equity earnings from DCP Midstream and improved results from our other Midstream operations. Both DCP Midstream and our equity affiliate in Trinidad benefited from significantly
higher NGL prices, which generally tracked the improved crude oil price environment in 2011. Also benefiting 2011 earnings were higher fees received for NGL fractionation services, reflecting favorably renegotiated contracts. These items were
partially offset by higher costs at DCP Midstream, primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs and increased DD A.

    2010 vs. 2009       Midstream earnings decreased 2 percent in 2010. Higher NGL prices and, to a lesser extent, improved volumes from our equity affiliate in Trinidad, were more than offset by the absence of the 2009
recognition of an $88 million after-tax benefit, which resulted from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. In addition, higher operating expenses contributed to the decrease in earnings.

   Our R M segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline,
distillates and aviation fuels); buys, sells and transports crude oil; and buys, transports, distributes and markets petroleum products. R M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.   
   2011 vs. 2010       R M reported
earnings of $3,751 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $192 million in 2010. See the  Business Environment and Executive Overview  section for additional information on industry refining margins.   
    U.S. R M        Earnings from U.S.
R M were $3,595 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $1,022 million in 2010. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset sales of $1,577
million after-tax mainly resulted from the sales of Seaway Products Pipeline Company and our equity investments in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, while 2010 included the $113 million after-tax gain on sale of our 50
percent interest in CFJ Properties. These increases were partially offset by the $303 million after-tax impairment and warehouse inventory write-down associated with our Trainer Refinery in 2011.   
  Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2011, compared with 90 percent in 2010. The increase mainly resulted from
lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned and unplanned downtime.        International R M     
  International R M reported earnings of $156 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $830 million in 2010. The increase in earnings was mostly due to
the absence of the 2010 WRG impairment, in addition to higher refining volumes and foreign currency gains in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower refining margins and the $86 million after-tax loss on sale of WRG and related
warehouse inventory write-downs in 2011.      Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2011, compared with
56 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from the removal of WRG from our refining capacities effective January 1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity.       2010 vs. 2009       R M reported earnings of $192 million in 2010, compared with earnings
of $37 million in 2009.        U.S. R M        Earnings from U.S. R M were $1,022 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $192 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and the gain on
sale of CFJ. Higher refining and marketing volumes also contributed to the improvement in earnings.      Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity
utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 87 percent in 2009. The increase in 2010 was largely due to lower turnaround activity, lower run reductions due to market conditions, and less unplanned downtime.   
    International R M     
  International R M reported a loss of $830 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $229 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 mainly resulted from the
WRG impairment and a $29 million after-tax impairment resulting from our decision to end participation in the Yanbu Refinery Project. Excluding these impairments, earnings were improved due to higher refining margins, partially offset by foreign
currency losses.      Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 56 percent in 2010, compared with 74 percent in
2009. The 2010 rate primarily reflected run reductions at WRG in response to market conditions.

    LUKOIL Investment        
    This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and
gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.       2011 vs. 2010    
  Earnings in 2011 primarily represented the realized gain on remaining share sales. Earnings in 2010 primarily reflected earnings from the equity
investment in LUKOIL we held at the time, in addition to gains on the partial sale of our LUKOIL investment.       2010 vs. 2009    
  LUKOIL segment earnings increased $1,284 million in 2010, which primarily resulted from the $1,251 million after-tax gain on our LUKOIL shares sold
during 2010.       Chemicals        
    The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem
uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals.       2011 vs. 2010       Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased 50 percent in 2011, primarily
due to higher margins, volumes and equity earnings in the olefins and polyolefins business line. The specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line also contributed to the increase in earnings due to higher margins.   
   2010 vs. 2009       Earnings from the
Chemicals segment increased $250 million in 2010, primarily due to substantially higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line and, to a lesser extent, improved margins from the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line.
Higher operating costs partially offset these increases.

    Emerging Businesses        

    The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of
operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the
environment.       2011 vs. 2010    
  The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $26 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $59 million in 2010. The increase in
 Power  earnings was primarily due to the absence of 2010 impairment charges related to a U.S. cogeneration plant, which was sold in December 2010, combined with higher international power generation results. Higher technology development
expenses contributed to the increase in  Other  losses in 2011.       2010 vs. 2009    
  The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $59 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3 million in 2009. The decrease in
 Power  earnings was mainly due to higher operating costs and lower margins in international power generation, in addition to the impairment charges and loss on sale of the U.S. cogeneration plant. Higher technology development expenses
contributed to the increase in  Other  losses in 2010.       Corporate and Other    
   
     2011 vs. 2010       Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 31 percent in
2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, which resulted from lower debt levels; the absence of a $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement, which occurred in 2010; and slightly higher interest income.   
  Separation costs consist of expenses incurred for the planned separation of our downstream businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded company,
Phillips 66. Expenses incurred in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs.

   The category  Other  includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental
costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the  Other  category primarily resulted from foreign currency transaction gains and lower environmental
costs, partially offset by a $20 million after-tax property impairment.       2010 vs. 2009    
  Net interest increased 13 percent in 2010, mostly due to the $114 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and a lower effective tax rate.
These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt levels.      Corporate general and administrative expenses
increased $101 million in 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans.      Changes in the
 Other  category primarily reflected foreign currency transaction losses.

    CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY        Financial Indicators        
       *Capital includes total debt and total equity.        **Includes effect of interest rate swaps.       To meet our short- and long-term liquidity
requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2011, we received $4,820 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2011, the primary uses of our
available cash were $13,266 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $11,123 million to repurchase common stock; $3,632 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $961 million to repay debt.
During 2011, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3,674 million to $5,780 million.      In addition to cash flows from operating
activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and short-term investment
balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the  Significant Sources of Capital  section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term,
including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL.       Significant
Sources of Capital         Operating Activities        During 2011, cash of $19,646 million was provided by operating activities, a 15 percent increase from cash from operations of $17,045 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity
prices in our E P segment and higher U.S. refining margins in our R M segment.      During 2010, cash flow from operations increased
$4,566 million, compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher crude oil prices in our E P segment and higher refining margins in our R M segment.      While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen,
natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. Crude oil prices increased in 2009, 2010 and 2011, although natural gas prices remained weak. Global refining margins were under pressure during 2009 and 2010.
Domestic refining margins significantly improved during the first three quarters of 2011, followed by a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 2011. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over
which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.   
         56

   The level of our production volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts
our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through
exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by
commodity prices.      Our E P production for 2011 averaged 1.62 million BOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties,
including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major
turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production in 2012, excluding the impact of any additional dispositions, is expected to be approximately 1.6 million BOED. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates
for our disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2012 and future years  production levels.   
  To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2011 was 112 percent,
including 117 percent from consolidated operations. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, the reserve replacement was 120 percent of 2011 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2011, our reserve
replacement was 30 percent (including 64 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL, the expropriation of our assets in Venezuela and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding
these items and acquisitions, our five-year reserve replacement was 102 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales)
divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the  Oil and Gas Operations  section of this report.
     We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has
become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil
companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow
us to replace our production over subsequent years.      As discussed in the  Critical Accounting Estimates  section, engineering
estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, revisions
increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.      In our R M
segment, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather
conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins.   
    Asset Sales        Proceeds from asset
sales in 2011 were $4.8 billion, compared with $15.4 billion in 2010. The 2011 proceeds from asset sales included $2.0 billion from the sale of our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and $1.2 billion
from the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL. Other asset sales primarily included mature North American natural gas assets and a products pipeline. We plan to raise an additional $5 billion to $10 billion from asset sales in 2012.

     Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities     
  In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35 billion revolving credit
facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in August 2016. The terms of the new revolving credit facility are similar to the terms of the replaced facility. We also have a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit
facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial
institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay
principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.      Credit
facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United
States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
     Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial
paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3 Project. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no
direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,128 million of commercial paper was outstanding at
December 31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December 31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity
under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2011.      Our senior long-term debt is rated  A1  by Moody s Investors
Service and  A  by both Standard and Poor s Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event
of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion and $500 million revolving credit
facilities.        Shelf Registration        We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt
and equity securities.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and
apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.      We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, an integrated project to produce and
liquefy natural gas from Qatar s North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui   Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned
company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. QG3 secured project financing of $4 billion in 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA),
$1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial
completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2011, QG3 had approximately $3.9 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, including $1.2 billion owed to ConocoPhillips.

   For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.       Capital Requirements    
  Our debt balance at December 31, 2011, was $22.6 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion during 2011, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 26
percent at year-end 2011, versus 25 percent at the end of 2010. The slight increase in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to a decrease in total equity resulting from the share repurchase programs in 2011, partially offset by the debt reduction. Our
debt-to-capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent.      In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. As part of
this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. Quarterly principal and interest payments
of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $732 million was short-term and was included in the  Accounts payable related parties 
line on our December 31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $695 million in 2011, is included in the  Other  line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement
of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the  Capital expenditures and
investments  line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.      During 2011, WRB Refining LP repaid $550 million of loan financing to
ConocoPhillips that had been provided to assist WRB in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. No outstanding balance remained at December 31, 2011.      In February 2012, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2012, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 21, 2012.   
  On March 24, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. Repurchase of shares under
this authorization was completed in the first quarter of 2011. On February 11, 2011, the Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. Repurchase of shares under this
authorization was completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under both programs, repurchases totaled 220 million shares at a cost of $15 billion through December 31, 2011. On December 2, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the
purchase of up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years.

    Contractual Obligations       The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2011:       

(a)  
  Includes $449 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

(b)  
  Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase
commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator.        The majority of the purchase
obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids, natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and
fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $71,737 million. In addition, $50,741 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and natural gas

  Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $918 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably
estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.         Capital Spending        
    Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ending December 31, 2011, totaled
$33.9 billion, with 87 percent allocated to our E P segment.      Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2012 is $14.8
billion. Included in this amount is approximately $0.4 billion in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 90 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E P and 8 percent to R M. With the addition of principal
contributions related to funding our portion of the FCCL business venture, our total capital program for 2012 is approximately $15.5 billion.        E P        Capital expenditures and investments for E P during the three-year
period ended December 31, 2011, totaled $29.4 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including:       

Oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming
and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.

     R M        Capital spending for R M during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, was primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery
upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R M capital spending was
$3.8 billion, which represented 11 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments.      Key projects during the three-year
period included:       

Installation of a 20,000-barrel-per-day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery.      

Installation of a 225-ton-per-day sulfur plant at the Sweeny Refinery.      

Installation of facilities to reduce emissions from the Fluid Catalytic Crackers at the Alliance and Sweeny refineries.      

Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the crude furnace and installation of a new vacuum furnace at the Bayway Refinery.

Completion of gasoline benzene reduction projects at the Alliance and Ponca City refineries.      
  Major construction activities in progress include:       

Installation, revamp and expansion of equipment at the Bayway Refinery to enable production of low benzene gasoline.      

U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions.         2012 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET      R M s 2012 capital expenditures and
investments budget is $1.2 billion, a 21 percent increase from actual spending in 2011, with about $1.0 billion targeted in the United States and $0.2 billion internationally. These funds will be used primarily for projects related to
sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance, efficiency and reliability.        Emerging
Businesses        Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, was primarily for an
expansion and other capital improvements at the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom.       Contingencies       A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against
ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at
various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss
is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these
liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted
loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.      Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote
that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we
reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated
future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and

the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as
additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.        Legal and Tax Matters     
  Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation
management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been
scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the
adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about
income-tax-related contingencies.        Environmental        We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and
regulations include, among others, the:       

U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.      

U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.      

European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).      

U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and
arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.      

U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.

U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area
in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.      

U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local
emergency planning committees and response departments.      

U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.      

U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of
pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.      

European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.      
  These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also,
in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In
addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.

   Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws
and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across
state and international borders.      The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor
easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about
global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation
obligations in the United States.      An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide
increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide
additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels that include a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with
advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements.      Another example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential
completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing
operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the
Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall
profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve
as technology improves and regulations change.      We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation
obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage
tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and
remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.      At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA,
which is often referred to as  Superfund,  the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be
required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may
fluctuate significantly.      We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state
environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests,
notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2010, we reported we had been
notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 73 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2011, we had been notified of 8 new sites, settled 5 sites and closed 2 sites, bringing the number to 74 unresolved
sites with potential liability.   
         65   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation
costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites
and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not
be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially
responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties
obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all
CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.      Expensed
environmental costs were $1,039 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $1,100 million per year in 2012 and 2013. Capitalized environmental costs were $573 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $875 million per year in 2012 and
2013.      Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are
not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).      Many of these liabilities
result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The
accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or
other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.      Remediation activities vary
substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable
third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.      At December 31, 2011, our
balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $922 million, compared with $994 million at December 31, 2010. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.   
  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent
concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as
a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.        Climate Change     
  There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed
or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or
our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect
our operations include:       

European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.
     
         66

California s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that
will target reduction of California s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020.      

Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility
with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of
12 percent of baseline emissions.      

The EPA s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as  Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act
Permitting Programs,  75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA s and U.S. Department of Transportation s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may
trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.      

Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.      

Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation which is scheduled to take effect July 2012.
        In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with
EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme.   
  In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions.
Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or
trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.      Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived
products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial
performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:       

Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted.      

The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).      

The GHG reductions required.      

The price and availability of offsets.      

The amount and allocation of allowances.      

Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.      

Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in
temperature).      

Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
         Other       We
have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized.
Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions
in future taxable income.

    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting
policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting
estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset
valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the
susceptibility of such matters to change.       Oil and Gas Accounting       Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the
discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether
proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.        Property Acquisition Costs     
  For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold
acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with
others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the
leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.      This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent
leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2011, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic
leasehold impairment calculation was $1,880 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $487 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 47 percent, and the weighted-average
amortization period was approximately four years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2012 would increase by approximately $22 million. The remaining
$5,966 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2011 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, suspended exploratory wells,
and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3.0
billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $97 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2012.        Exploratory Costs        For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily
capitalized, or  suspended,  on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well.   
  If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as
sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of  sufficient progress  is a judgmental area, but
  
         68

  Index to Financial Statements  

the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make
the project s development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is
ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are
moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we
perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not
encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.   
  Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and
expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and
hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment.   
  At year-end 2011, total suspended well costs were $1,037 million, compared with $1,013 million at year-end 2010. For additional information on
suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   
    Proved Reserves        Engineering
estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of
in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both
the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.      Despite the
inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of  proved  reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a
company s E P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as  proved.  Our reservoir engineering organization has policies
and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
     Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account
recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and
year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.   
  Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the  economic interest 
method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For
example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the
denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of DD A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2011, the net book value of productive E P properties, plants and equipment (PP E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation
was approximately $57 billion and the DD A   
         69

  Index to Financial Statements  

recorded on these assets in 2011 was approximately $6.6 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2010 and 5.1
billion BOE at the end of 2011. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD A in 2011 would have increased by an estimated $347 million.
      Impairments       Long-lived
assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter
following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are
grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field-by-field basis for
exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present
values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where
possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project
decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.      Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to
corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair
value less than the investment s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment s
carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee s
financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market
prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets
owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.      Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs       Under various contracts, permits and
regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and
disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued
into PP E at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in
the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance
considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.      Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end
of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset   
         70   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair
value of these properties.      In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have
certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future
environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the
determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.       Business Acquisitions    
    Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed        Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities,
the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving PP E and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value
determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations.   
    Intangible Assets and Goodwill     
  At December 31, 2011, we had $701 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This
judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to
commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management s judgment of the estimated fair value
of these intangible assets.      At December 31, 2011, we had $3,332 million of goodwill on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable
to the Worldwide R M reporting unit. See Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill.       Projected Benefit Obligations       Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our
defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit
obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future
health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations
and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining
required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for
the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used
in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the
discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining the discount rate,
we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.

    OUTLOOK         Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses        On July 14, 2011, we announced
approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be
headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain
technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company. The separation is to be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips
stock held by ConocoPhillips  shareholders on the record date for the share distribution.      In October 2011, we requested a private letter
ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66 Form 10 registration statement
with the SEC on November 14, 2011, and an amendment on January 3, 2012.      The separation is subject to market conditions, customary
regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012.      As part of the separation, we expect to receive a cash distribution from Phillips 66. These funds will primarily be used to repay debt, with the balance directed to share repurchases and dividends. In
conjunction with the separation, we expect to incur one-time legal, information technology, audit, advisor, and deferred and cash tax costs, resulting in an estimated pre-separation earnings impact of approximately $150 million after-tax, of which
$25 million was incurred in 2011.        China Bohai Bay        On July 13, 2011, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) in the People s Republic of China instructed us to suspend production from the Peng Lai 19-3 Field Platforms B and C, as a result of two
separate seepage incidents which occurred near the platforms. On September 2, 2011, the SOA ordered us to halt operations at the Peng Lai 19-3 Field, pending additional cleanup efforts and reservoir depressurization activities to ensure any
residual seepage had stopped. The incidents resulted in a total release of approximately 700 barrels of oil into Bohai Bay and approximately 2,600 barrels of mineral oil-based drilling mud onto the seafloor. The mineral oil-based drilling mud
was recovered and cleaned up from the seafloor. The sources of the seeps have been sealed and containment devices deployed as a preventative measure to capture any residue.      The SOA also required implementation of preventative measures to avoid recurrence, in addition to the filing of an updated environmental impact assessment and development plan for approval. A revised
development plan was submitted to China s National Development and Reform Commission in November 2011 and is currently under review. A revised environmental impact assessment was submitted to the SOA in February 2012.   
  The approved depressurization plan, combined with limited development and field optimization, reduced 2011 average daily net production from the field by
14,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to 2010 production levels. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.      In January
2012, we and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced an agreement with China s Ministry of Agriculture to resolve fishery-related issues in connection with the seepage incidents. Under this agreement, approximately $160 million
will be paid as compensation to settle private claims of potentially affected fishermen in relevant Bohai Bay communities, and public claims for alleged fishery damage. We hold a 49 percent ownership interest in the Peng Lai fields. The agreement
fulfills the objectives of the compensation fund we announced in September 2011. As part of this agreement, we have also designated approximately $16 million of our previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources and
for related projects.

    CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES
LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995       This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words  anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   budget,

 objective,   projection,   forecast,   goal,   guidance,   outlook,   effort,   target  and similar expressions.   
  We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in
general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based
many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking
statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following:       

Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals
business.      

Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to
operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance.      

Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage.      

Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance.      

Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production,
manufacturing, refining or transportation projects.      

Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including chemicals products.

Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, bitumen, LNG and refined
products.      

Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects, construction of LNG terminals or
regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance.      

Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and
production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects.      

Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism or
cyber attacks.      

International monetary conditions and exchange controls.      

Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations.

Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations.      

Liability resulting from litigation.      

General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental
policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations.

Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business.

Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial
markets.      

Delays in, or our inability to implement, our asset disposition plan.      

Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes.

The factors generally described in Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.      
     Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
   Financial Instrument Market Risk       We
and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and
commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market
opportunities.      Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an  Authority Limitations  document approved by our Board of
Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company,
and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The senior vice president of Commercial
monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks related to our upstream and downstream
businesses.        Commodity Price Risk        We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities.
These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities.   
  Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our
risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives:       

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by
physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demands.      

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales
contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to floating market prices.      

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions.

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more
profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities.      
  We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market
conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2011, as derivative instruments. Using
Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net
income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips.

     Interest Rate Risk        The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related
weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the
fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL
Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at year-end 2011 and 2010 effective yield rates of 1.24 percent and 1.87 percent, respectively, based on yields of
U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips  average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.   
   
    During the second quarter of 2010, we executed interest rate swaps to synthetically convert $500 million of our 4.60%
fixed-rate notes due in 2015 to a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting. The short-cut method permits the
assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. These adjustments to the fair values of the interest rate swaps
and hedged debt have not been material.   
         75   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

     Foreign Currency Exchange Risk        We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge
certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.   
  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange
swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change
in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender
or borrower, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2011, or 2010, exchange rates. The notional
and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2011 and 2010, were as follows:       
       *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR).    
   **Denominated in U.S. dollars.       For
additional information about our use of derivative instruments, see Note 16 Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Report of Management       Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements present fairly the
company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based
on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company s financial statements have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit
and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst   Young LLP all of the company s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders  and
directors  meetings.       Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
  Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips  internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.      All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.      Management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in  Internal Control Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment,
we believe the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.      Ernst   Young
LLP has issued an audit report on the company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, and their report is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders   
  ConocoPhillips      We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the related condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at Item 8 and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements, condensed
consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule based
on our audits.      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ConocoPhillips  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on        Internal Control Over Financial Reporting       The Board of Directors and Stockholders
     ConocoPhillips      We have audited
ConocoPhillips  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips  management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included
under the heading  Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  in the accompanying  Report of Management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.      We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.      A company s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.      Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.      In our opinion, ConocoPhillips
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2011 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report dated
February 21, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
    Note 1 Accounting Policies    

Consolidation Principles and Investments  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled
subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. The equity method is used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates  operating and
financial policies. When we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, the investment is either classified as available-for-sale if fair value is readily determinable, or the cost method is used if fair value is not readily
determinable. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.      

Foreign Currency Translation  Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into
U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in common stockholders  equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Most of our foreign operations use their local currency as the
functional currency.      

Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition  Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids,
petroleum and chemical products, and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer, which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs, either immediately or within a fixed delivery
schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry.         Revenues associated with producing properties in
which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working interest, which are deemed to be
nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant.   
  Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same
counterparty are entered into  in contemplation  of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).   

Shipping and Handling Costs  Our Exploration and Production (E P) segment includes shipping and handling costs in production and
operating expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to E P marketing activities are recorded in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. The Refining and Marketing (R M) segment records shipping and handling
costs in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. Freight costs billed to customers are recorded as a component of revenue.      

Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have
original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.      

         86   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

Short-Term Investments  Investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) with
original maturities of greater than 90 days but less than one year are classified as short-term investments. See Note 16 Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, for additional information on these held-to-maturity financial instruments.

Inventories  We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type
of inventory. Crude oil and petroleum products inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as
permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues and to meet tax-conformity requirements. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or
product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various
methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, consistent with industry practice.      

Fair Value Measurements  We categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the
observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by
market participants.      

Derivative Instruments  Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists and certain
other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
        Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative
to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair
value hedge, the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
Gains or losses from derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity are recognized in other comprehensive income and appear on the balance sheet in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings; however, to the extent the change in the value of the derivative exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses will
be recognized immediately in earnings.   

Oil and Gas Exploration and Development  Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method
of accounting.          Property Acquisition Costs  Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are
capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment (PP E). Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management s judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for
reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.       Exploratory
Costs  Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or  suspended,  on the balance sheet pending further
evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and
gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex
  
         87   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the
potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and
the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.      Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly,
continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. See Note
8 Suspended Wells, for additional information on suspended wells.       Development Costs  Costs incurred to drill
and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.       Depletion and
Amortization  Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method
using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.   

Capitalized Interest  Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or
longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.      

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill  Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over their
useful lives. Intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets not being amortized to determine
whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful lives. These indefinite lived intangibles are considered impaired if the fair value of the intangible asset is lower than net book value. The fair value of intangible assets is
determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value of intangible assets is determined based upon the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates
believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or upon estimated replacement cost, if expected future cash flows from the intangible asset are not determinable.      

Goodwill  Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. If the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than the recorded book value of the reporting unit s assets (including goodwill), less liabilities, then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed on the reporting unit s assets and liabilities using
the fair value of the reporting unit as the purchase price in the calculation. If the amount of goodwill resulting from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the recorded amount of goodwill, the recorded goodwill is written down
to the new amount. For purposes of goodwill impairment calculations, two reporting units have been determined: Worldwide Exploration and Production and Worldwide Refining and Marketing.      

Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization of PP E on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain pipeline assets
(those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other PP E are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the
group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).      

Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment  PP E used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and
circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of
     
         88   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation
provisions and reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for
long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or based on a
multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value,
less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.      
  The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production
volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review. If the future production price risk has been hedged, the hedged price is used in the calculations for the period and quantities hedged. For E P assets, the
impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of
these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.   

Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities  Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes
in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment
is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by
principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.      

Maintenance and Repairs  Costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred. Major
refinery turnarounds are expensed as incurred.      

Advertising Costs  Production costs of media advertising are deferred until the first public showing of the advertisement. Advances to
secure advertising slots at specific sporting or other events are deferred until the event occurs. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred, unless the cost has benefits that clearly extend beyond the interim period in which the
expenditure is made, in which case the advertising cost is deferred and amortized ratably over the interim periods that clearly benefit from the expenditure.      

Property Dispositions  When complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are
eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the  Gain on dispositions  line of our consolidated income statement. When less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired, the difference between asset cost and
salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.      

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs  The fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are
recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related
PP E. Over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in PP E is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. For additional information, see Note 11 Asset Retirement
Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for additional information.      
         89   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic
benefit. Expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a
purchase business combination) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties, such as state reimbursement funds, are recorded as
assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.   

Guarantees  Fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is
subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the
guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We
amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable,
based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.      

Stock-Based Compensation  We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of
time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for
the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.      

Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are
applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest expense, and penalties in production and operating expenses.      

Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities  Excise taxes are reported gross within sales and other operating
revenues and taxes other than income taxes, while other sales and value-added taxes are recorded net in taxes other than income taxes.      

Net Income Per Share of Common Stock  Basic net income per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the year, including unallocated shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Also, this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have not been issued. Diluted
net income per share of common stock includes the above, plus unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share.
For the purpose of the 2009 earnings per share calculation, net income attributable to ConocoPhillips was reduced by $12 million for the excess of the amount paid for the redemption of a noncontrolling interest over its carrying value, which was
charged directly to retained earnings. Treasury stock and shares held by grantor trusts are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations.

Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles    

    Comprehensive Income       Effective December 31, 2011, we early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05,  Presentation of Comprehensive Income.  This
ASU amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 220,  Comprehensive Income,  by requiring a more prominent presentation of the components of other comprehensive income. We elected the two-statement approach presenting other
comprehensive income in a separate statement immediately following the income statement. On December 23, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12,  Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items
Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05.  ASU 2011-12 defers the ASU 2011-05 requirement to present items reclassified into net income from other comprehensive income. This deferral only impacted the presentation
requirement on the consolidated income statement.   

    Note 3 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)    
   We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. Information
on our significant VIE follows:      We have an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in an LNG receiving
terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in Freeport LNG; however, we own a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc. (Freeport GP), which serves as the general partner managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with
Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity. The terminal became
operational in June 2008, and we began making payments under the terminal use agreement. Freeport LNG began making loan repayments in September 2008, and the loan balance outstanding as of December 31, 2011, was $612 million. Freeport LNG
is a VIE because Freeport GP holds no equity in Freeport LNG, and the limited partners of Freeport LNG do not have any substantive decision making ability. We performed an analysis of the expected losses and determined we are not the primary
beneficiary. This expected loss analysis took into account that the credit support arrangement requires Freeport LNG to maintain sufficient commercial insurance to mitigate any loan losses. The loan to Freeport LNG is accounted for as a financial
asset, and our investment in Freeport GP is accounted for as an equity investment.

Note 4 Inventories    
   Inventories at December 31 were:       

Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $3,387 million and $4,051 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories amounted to approximately $8,400 million and $6,800 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, a liquidation of LIFO inventory values
increased net income attributable to ConocoPhillips $160 million, of which $155 million was attributable to the R M segment.   
    Note 5 Assets Held for Sale or Sold    
   In December 2011, we sold our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. The total carrying
value of these assets, which were included in our R M segment, was $348 million, which included $104 million of investment in equity affiliates and $244 million of allocated goodwill. The $1,661 million before-tax gain on these dispositions
was included in the  Gain on dispositions  line in the consolidated income statement.      In June 2010, we sold our 9.03 percent
interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture for $4.6 billion. The $2.9 billion before-tax gain was included in the  Gain on dispositions  line of our consolidated income statement. At the time of disposition, Syncrude had a net
carrying value of $1.75 billion, which included $1.97 billion of PP E, and was included in the E P segment.      In February 2012, we
signed definitive agreements to sell our Vietnam E P business for $1.29 billion, excluding customary working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012. At December 31, 2011, this business had a net
carrying value of approximately $150 million, which included PP E of $350 million.      See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term
Receivables, for information on the disposition of our investment in OAO LUKOIL during 2010 and 2011.

    Equity Investments       Affiliated companies in which we had a significant equity investment at December 31, 2011, included:       

Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) 42.5 percent owned joint venture with Origin Energy (42.5 percent) and China Petrochemical Corporation
(Sinopec) (15 percent) to develop coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, as well as process and export LNG.      

FCCL Partnership 50 percent owned business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. produces bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern
Alberta and sells the bitumen blend.      

WRB Refining LP 50 percent owned business venture with Cenovus owns the Wood River and Borger refineries, which process crude oil into
refined products.      

Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited 3 (QG3) 30 percent owned joint venture with affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui  
Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent) produces and liquefies natural gas from Qatar s North Field.      

DCP Midstream, LLC 50 percent owned joint venture with Spectra Energy owns and operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage
facilities and fractionation plants.      

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) 50 percent owned joint venture with Chevron Corporation manufactures and markets
petrochemicals and plastics.         Summarized 100 percent financial information for equity method investments in affiliated
companies, combined, was as follows (information includes LUKOIL until loss of significant influence):       

Our share of income taxes incurred directly by the equity companies is reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is not
included in income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.      At December 31, 2011, retained earnings included $2,814 million
related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies. Dividends received from affiliates were $3,670 million, $2,282 million and $1,727 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   
   APLNG       In 2008, we closed on a
transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. APLNG is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and
LNG processing and export sales. This transaction gives us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position with the expected creation of an additional LNG hub targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin is the operator
of APLNG s production and pipeline system, while we will operate the LNG facility.      In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive
agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin
Energy s ownership interest diluting to 42.5 percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011, and we recorded a loss on disposition of $279 million before- and after-tax from the dilution. The book value of our investment
in APLNG was reduced by $795 million, and we reduced the currency translation adjustment associated with our investment by $516 million.   
         93   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   In November 2011, APLNG signed a binding Heads of Agreement with Japan-based Kansai Electric for the sale of
approximately 1 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Kansai Electric will be supplied LNG beginning in mid-2016. The agreement is also subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train,
which is expected in the first half of 2012.      In January 2012, APLNG and Sinopec signed an amendment to their existing LNG sales agreement for
the sale and purchase of an additional 3.3 million tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train. This agreement, in combination with the Kansai Electric agreement, finalizes the marketing
of the second train. In conjunction with the LNG sale, the parties have also agreed for Sinopec to subscribe for additional shares in APLNG, which will raise its equity interest from 15 percent to 25 percent. As a result, both our
ownership interest and Origin Energy s ownership interest would dilute from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. We expect to record a loss of approximately $135 million after-tax from the dilution.   
  At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $9,467 million, which includes $2,716 million of cumulative
translation effects due to a strengthening Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our 42.5 percent share of the historical cost basis net assets of APLNG on its books under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles was $2,380
million, resulting in a basis difference of $7,087 million on our books. The amortizable portion of the basis difference, $5,192 million associated with PP E, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual exploration and
production license areas owned by APLNG, most of which are not currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators
of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference amortization. As the joint venture begins producing natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the
unit-of-production method. Included in net income attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was after-tax expense of $17 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference
on currently producing licenses.       FCCL and WRB       We have two 50/50 North American heavy oil business ventures with Cenovus Energy Inc.: FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, and WRB Refining LP, a U.S. downstream limited
partnership. We use the equity method of accounting for both entities, with the operating results of our investment in FCCL reflecting the use of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.
     At December 31, 2011, the book value of our investment in FCCL was $9,044 million. FCCL s operating assets consist of the Foster
Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Cenovus is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. We are obligated to contribute
$7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period that began in 2007. For additional information on this obligation, see Note 13 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation.      At December 31, 2011, the book value of our investment in WRB was $3,722 million. WRB s operating assets consist of the Wood River and Borger refineries, located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger,
Texas, respectively. As a result of our contribution of these two assets to WRB, a basis difference was created due to the fair value of the contributed assets recorded by WRB exceeding their historical book value. The difference is primarily
amortized and recognized as a benefit evenly over a period of 26 years, which was the estimated remaining useful life of the refineries  PP E at the closing date. The basis difference at December 31, 2011, was $3,918 million. Equity
earnings in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were increased by $185 million, $243 million and $209 million, respectively, due to amortization of the basis difference. We are the operator and managing partner of WRB. Cenovus is obligated to contribute
$7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year period that began in 2007.       QG3    
  QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance
of $1,159 million as described below under  Loans and Long-term Receivables.  At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in QG3 was   
         94

$931 million. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Port Arthur, Texas, in which we have a 12.4 percent
interest, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. However, currently the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the United States.   
   DCP Midstream       DCP Midstream owns and
operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation plants. At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in DCP Midstream was $927 million. DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas
liquids to us and CPChem under a supply agreement that continues at the current volume commitment with a primary term ending December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an  if-produced, will-purchase  basis and so has no fixed
production schedule, but has had, and is expected over the remaining term of the contract to have, a relatively stable purchase pattern. Natural gas liquids are purchased under this agreement at various published market index prices, less
transportation and fractionation fees.       CPChem       CPChem manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. At December 31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in CPChem was $2,998 million. We have multiple supply and purchase
agreements in place with CPChem, ranging in initial terms from one to 99 years, with extension options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined products, solvents, and petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as
fuel oils and gases. Delivery quantities vary by product, and are generally on an  if-produced, will-purchase  basis. All products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices.
     In anticipation of the separation of our downstream businesses (including CPChem), we reached agreement with Chevron Corporation regarding
CPChem that provides for CPChem to: (i) prior to the separation, suspend all cash distributions to its owners and accumulate its excess cash; and (ii) after the separation, use the accumulated cash and its excess cash flow to pay down $1
billion of its outstanding fixed-rate bonds on an accelerated basis. During this period of bond repayment, CPChem is not required to make any cash distributions to its owners.       LUKOIL       LUKOIL is an integrated energy company headquartered in Russia. We completed the
disposition of our interest in LUKOIL during the first quarter of 2011, realizing a before-tax gain of $360 million, which was included in the  Gain on dispositions  line of our consolidated income statement, and cash proceeds of
$1,243 million. Our ownership interest was 2.25 percent at December 31, 2010, and 20 percent at December 31, 2009.      On
July 28, 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL, then consisting of 163.4 million shares. This decision was implemented as follows:   

On July 28, 2010, we entered into a stock purchase and option agreement (the Agreement) with a wholly owned subsidiary of LUKOIL, pursuant to
which such subsidiary purchased 64.6 million shares from us at a price of $53.25 per share, or $3,442 million in total. This transaction closed on August 16, 2010.      

Also pursuant to the Agreement, the LUKOIL subsidiary had a 60-day option, expiring on September 26, 2010, to purchase any or all of our interest
remaining at the time of exercise of the option, at a price of $56 per share. Upon exercise of this option, we sold 42.5 million shares on September 29, 2010, for proceeds of $2,380 million.      

Finally, we sold our remaining shares in the open market subject to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, with the final disposition of all shares
occurring in the first quarter of 2011. The cost basis for shares sold was average cost.      
         95   

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   During the third quarter of 2010, our ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able
to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, we stopped applying the equity method of accounting for our remaining investment in LUKOIL, and we
reclassified the investment from  Investments and long-term receivables  to current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as an available-for-sale equity security.      In total, during 2010, we sold 151 million shares of LUKOIL for $8,345 million, realizing a before-tax gain on disposition of $1,749 million, which was included in the  Gain on
dispositions  line of our consolidated income statement. Included in these amounts were sales proceeds of $1,793 million and a realized before-tax gain of $437 million incurred subsequent to classifying the investment as
available-for-sale. The cost basis for shares sold is average cost.      At December 31, 2010, our then remaining investment in LUKOIL was
carried at fair value of $1,083 million, reflecting a closing price of LUKOIL American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the London Stock Exchange of $56.50 per share. The carrying value reflected a pre-tax unrealized gain over our cost basis of
$247 million. This unrealized gain, net of related income taxes, was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value was categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.   
  While applying the equity method of accounting, a negative basis difference existed which was primarily amortized on a straight-line basis over a 22-year
useful life as an increase to equity earnings. Equity earnings in 2010 and 2009 were increased $155 million and $157 million, respectively, due to amortization of this basis difference.       Loans and Long-term Receivables       As part of our normal ongoing business operations and
consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans and long-term receivables to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies. Loans are
recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or non-affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance and will decrease as
interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreement s stated interest rate. Loans and long-term receivables are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance may not be fully recovered.
     At December 31, 2011, significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:   

$612 million in loan financing to Freeport LNG Development, L.P. for the construction of an LNG receiving terminal that became operational in June
2008. Freeport began making repayments in 2008 and is required to continue making repayments through full repayment of the loan in 2026. Repayment by Freeport is supported by  process-or-pay  capacity service payments made by us to
Freeport under our terminal use agreement.          

$1,159 million in project financing to QG3. We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, for which we use the equity method of accounting. The other
participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum and Mitsui. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial
banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan
facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. Bi-annual repayments began in January 2011 and will extend through July 2022.         The long-term portion of these loans are included in the  Loans and advances related parties  line on the consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in  Accounts and
notes receivable related parties.       WRB Refining LP fully repaid its outstanding loans from us with payments of $550 million in
2011.   
         96

   In November 2011, a long-term loan to a non-affiliated company related to seller financing of U.S. retail
marketing assets was refinanced, which resulted in a receipt of $365 million. As part of the refinancing, we provided loan guarantees in support of $191 million of the total refinancing.      Long-term receivables and the long-term portion of these loans are included in the  Investments and long-term receivables  line on the consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion
related to non-affiliate loans is in  Accounts and notes receivable.        Other    
  We have investments remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis to support certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair value of these
assets at December 31, 2011, was $336 million, and at December 31, 2010, was $325 million. Substantially the entire value is categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. These investments are measured at fair value using a
market approach based on quotations from national securities exchanges.      Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) owns a delayed coker and related facilities
at the Sweeny Refinery. MSLP processes our long residue, which is produced from heavy sour crude oil, for a processing fee. Fuel-grade petroleum coke is produced as a by-product and becomes the property of MSLP. Prior to August 28, 2009, MSLP
was owned 50/50 by us and Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Under the agreements that govern the relationships between the partners, certain defaults by PDVSA with respect to supply of crude oil to the Sweeny Refinery gave us the right to
acquire PDVSA s 50 percent ownership interest in MSLP, which we exercised on August 28, 2009. PDVSA has initiated arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce challenging the exercise of the call right and claiming it was
invalid. The arbitral tribunal is scheduled to hold hearings on the merits of the dispute in December 2012. We continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in MSLP.   
    Note 7 Properties, Plants and Equipment    
   PP E is recorded at cost. Within the E P segment, depreciation is mainly on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life
will vary by field. In the R M segment, investments in refining manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life, and pipeline assets over a 45-year life. The company s investment in PP E,
with accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (Accum. DD A), at December 31 was:

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

     2011        In 2011, we recorded a $467 million impairment of our refinery and associated pipelines and terminals in Trainer, Pennsylvania. In September 2011, we announced plans to seek a buyer for the refinery and
have idled the facility. If unable to sell the refinery, we expect to permanently close the plant by the end of the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we recorded property impairments of $288 million in our E P segment, primarily as a result
of lower natural gas price assumptions and reduced volume forecasts.        2010     
  During 2010, we recorded a $1,514 million impairment of our refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, due to canceled plans for a project to upgrade the
refinery, as well as a $98 million impairment as a result of our decision to end our participation in a new refinery project in Yanbu Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. We also recorded various property impairments of $81 million in our E P segment.
       2009        During 2009, we
recorded property impairments of $417 million in our E P segment, primarily as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions, reduced volume forecasts, and higher royalty, operating costs and capital expenditure assumptions. Additionally, we
recorded a noncash charge of $51 million before- and after-tax related to the full impairment of our exploration and production investments in Ecuador, due to their expropriation. An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March
2011, and the arbitration process is ongoing. Property impairments of $66 million in our R M segment, primarily associated with planned asset dispositions, were also recorded during 2009.       Fair Value Remeasurements       The following table shows the values of assets, by major
category, measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition:       

      * Represents the fair value at the time of the impairment.    
  ** Includes a $55 million leasehold impairment charged to exploration expenses.    
     2011        During
2011, net PP E held for use with a carrying amount of $427 million was written down to a fair value of $162 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $265 million. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow
models using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and cash flow multiples for similar assets and alternative use.   
  Also during 2011, certain equity method investments were determined to have fair values below their carrying amount, and the impairments were considered
to be other than temporary. This primarily included an investment associated with our E P segment with a book value of $651 million, which was written down to its fair value of $256 million, resulting in a charge of $395 million
before-tax. This was included in the  Equity in earnings of affiliates  line of our consolidated income statement. The fair value was determined by the application of an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future
production, prices, costs and a   
         101

discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. In addition, the fair value was determined by the comparison of market data for certain similar
undeveloped properties.        2010        During 2010, net PP E held for use with a carrying amount of $1,911 million was written down to a fair value of $307 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $1,604 million. The fair values
were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and cash flow multiples for similar
assets and alternative use.      Also during 2010, net PP E held for sale with a carrying amount of $64 million was written down to a
fair value of $23 million less cost to sell of $2 million for a net $21 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $43 million. The fair values were primarily determined by binding negotiated selling prices with third parties, with some
adjusted for the fair value of certain liabilities retained.      In addition, an equity method investment associated with our E P segment was
determined to have a fair value below carrying amount, and the impairment was considered to be other than temporary. This investment with a book value of $1,380 million was written down to its fair value of $735 million, resulting in a charge
of $645 million before-tax, which was included in the  Equity in earnings of affiliates  line of our consolidated income statement. The fair value was determined by the application of an internal discounted cash flow model using
estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. In addition, the equity investment fair value was determined by the comparison of market data for certain
similar undeveloped properties.   
    Note 11 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs    
   Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31 were:   

* Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet, under the caption  Other accruals.     
    Asset Retirement Obligations       We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded,
we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the
related asset.      We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently
taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve plugging
and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries.   
         102

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   During 2011 and 2010, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows:   

Accrued Environmental Costs       Total accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2011 and 2010, were $922 million and $994 million, respectively. The 2011 decrease in total accrued environmental costs is due to payments and
settlements during the year exceeding new accruals, accrual adjustments and accretion.      We had accrued environmental costs of
$571 million and $624 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and
the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $274 million and $278 million of environmental costs associated with nonoperator sites at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In
addition, $77 million and $92 million were included at both December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.   
  Because a large portion of the accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected
expenditures for acquired environmental obligations are discounted using a weighted-average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $427 million at December 31, 2011. The
expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $58 million in 2012, $44 million in 2013, $22 million in 2014, $19 million in 2015, $20 million in 2016, and
$373 million for all future years after 2016.

Note 12 Debt    
   Long-term debt at December 31 was:   

104

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   Maturities of long-term borrowings, inclusive of net unamortized premiums and discounts, in 2012 through
2016 are: $1,013 million, $1,275 million, $1,527 million, $1,571 million and $2,364 million, respectively. At December 31, 2011, we classified $1,058 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to
refinance the obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facilities.      During 2011, the following debt instruments were repaid
at their maturity:       
 
    In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in
August 2016. We also have a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our
commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings.
The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.   
  Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin
above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our
current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.      We have two commercial paper programs: the
ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion program, primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3
Project. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued. In
addition, under the two commercial paper programs, there was $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December 31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper
outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2011.   
    Note 13 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation    
   In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus. As a part of the transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus
interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL Partnership, formed as a result of the transaction.   
  Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the
principal obligation amount, $732 million was short-term and was included in the  Accounts payable related parties  line on our December 31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled
$695 million in 2011, is included in the  Other  line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of
the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the  Capital expenditures and investments  line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Note 14 Guarantees    
   At December 31, 2011, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described
below. We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because
the guarantees were issued prior to December 31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future
performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.       Construction Completion Guarantees    
  In December 2005, we issued a construction completion guarantee for 30 percent of the $4 billion in loan facilities of QG3, which are being used
to finance the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. Of the $4 billion in loan facilities, we committed to provide $1.2 billion. Effective December 15, 2011, the project achieved financial completion, the financing became nonrecourse
to ConocoPhillips and our guarantee was released.       Guarantees of Joint Venture Debt    
  At December 31, 2011, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 24 years. The
maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees is approximately $100 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations.       Other Guarantees        

In conjunction with our purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy in October 2008, we agreed to participate, if and when requested,
in any parent company guarantees that were outstanding at the time we purchased our interest in APLNG. These parent company guarantees cover the obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements with remaining terms of 5 to
20 years. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $1,261 million ($2,820 million in the event of intentional or reckless breach) at December 2011 exchange rates based on
our 42.5 percent share of the remaining contracted volumes, which could become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the
payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG. Additionally, we have guaranteed
the performance of APLNG with regard to certain contracts executed in connection with APLNG s issuance of the Train 1 Notice to Proceed. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is estimated to be
$171 million at December 2011 exchange rates based on our 42.5 percent ownership in APLNG.          

We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling $450 million, which consist primarily of guarantees to fund the
short-term cash liquidity deficits of certain joint ventures, a guarantee of minimum charter revenue for two LNG vessels, one small construction completion guarantee, guarantees relating to the startup of a refining joint venture, guarantees of the
lease payment obligations of a joint venture, guarantees of the residual value of leased corporate aircraft, and guarantees of the performance of a business partner or some of its customers. These guarantees generally extend up to 13 years or
life of the venture.          Indemnifications       Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. Agreements associated
with these sales include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, permits and licenses, employee claims, real estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The
  
         106

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amount
recorded for these indemnifications at December 31, 2011, was $362 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In
cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification
exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments.
Included in the recorded carrying amount were $218 million of environmental accruals for known contamination that are included in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2011. For additional information
about environmental liabilities, see Note 15 Contingencies and Commitments.   
    Note 15 Contingencies and Commitments    
   A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of
business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the
need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a
range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.
If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than
certain. See Note 20 Income Taxes, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.      Based on currently available
information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new
facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental
remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required,
and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the
administrative and litigation processes.       Environmental       We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based
on management s best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account
stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies  cleanup experience, and data released by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.   
  Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently
so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially
responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned.
Prior to actual cleanup,

those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a
settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals
accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnifications are
subject to dollar limits and time limits.      We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal
Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted
basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the
future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings. See Note 11 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.   
   Legal Proceedings       Our legal
organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the
early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these
litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new
accruals, is required.       Other Contingencies       We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide
any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2011, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $1,954
million (of which $40 million was issued under the provisions of our revolving credit facility, and the remainder was issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and items
of permanent investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business.      In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with
respect to our migration to an  empresa mixta  structure mandated by the Venezuelan government s Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela s national oil company, PDVSA, or its affiliates, directly assumed control over
ConocoPhillips  interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the
World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we are currently awaiting an interim decision on key legal and factual
issues. A separate arbitration hearing was held in January 2012 before the International Chamber of Commerce on ConocoPhillips  separate claims against PDVSA for certain breaches of their Association Agreements prior to the expropriation.
     In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of
Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and
its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil. In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim.
An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011. On September 30, 2011, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe will not be material. The arbitration process is ongoing. For
additional information, see Note 10 Impairments.

    Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements    
  We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or
crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of the company s business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements are: 2012 $468 million; 2013 $467 million; 2014 $467 million;
2015 $458 million; 2016 $364 million; and 2017 and after $4,890 million. Total payments under the agreements were $429 million in 2011, $216 million in 2010 and $114 million in 2009.   
    Note 16 Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts    
    Financial Instruments    
  We invest excess cash in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various currency pools we manage. The maturities of
these investments may from time to time extend beyond 90 days. The types of financial instruments in which we currently invest include:       

Time Deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with approved financial institutions.      

Commercial Paper: Unsecured promissory notes issued by a corporation, commercial bank, or government agency purchased at a discount, maturing at par.

Government or government agency obligations: Negotiable debt obligations issued by a government or government agency.      
  These financial instruments appear in the  Cash and cash equivalents  line of our consolidated balance sheet if the maturities at the time we
made the investments were 90 days or less; otherwise, these held-to-maturity investments are included in the  Short-term investments  line. At December 31, we held the following financial instruments:   

* Carrying value approximates fair value.    
    Derivative Instruments    
  We use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and
interest rates, or to capture market opportunities. Since we are not currently using cash-flow hedge accounting, all gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from derivative contracts have been recognized in the consolidated income statement. Gains
and losses from derivative contracts held for trading not directly related to our physical business, whether realized or unrealized, have been reported net in other income.      Purchase and sales contracts with fixed minimum notional volumes for commodities that are readily convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil, natural gas and gasoline) are recorded on the balance sheet as
derivatives   
         109

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

unless the contracts are eligible for and we elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception (i.e., contracts to purchase or sell quantities we expect to use or sell over a reasonable
period in the normal course of business). We record most of our contracts to buy or sell natural gas and the majority of our contracts to sell power as derivatives, but we do apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception to certain long-term
contracts to sell our natural gas production. We generally apply this normal purchases and normal sales exception to eligible crude oil and refined product commodity purchase and sales contracts; however, we may elect not to apply this exception
(e.g., when another derivative instrument will be used to mitigate the risk of the purchase or sales contract but hedge accounting will not be applied, in which case both the purchase or sales contract and the derivative contract mitigating the
resulting risk will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value).      We value our exchange-traded derivatives using closing prices provided
by the exchange as of the balance sheet date, and these are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Where exchange-provided prices are adjusted, non-exchange quotes are used, or when the instrument lacks sufficient liquidity, we generally
classify those exchange-cleared contracts as Level 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps and physical commodity forward purchase and sales contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers and price index developers, such as
Platts and Oil Price Information Service. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are classified as Level 2. In certain less liquid markets or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these
circumstances, OTC swaps and physical commodity purchase and sales contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships among various commodities that result in management s best estimate of fair
value. These contracts are classified as Level 3. A contract that is initially classified as Level 3 due to absence or insufficient corroboration of broker quotes over a material portion of the contract will transfer to Level 2 when the portion of
the trade having no quotes or insufficient corroboration becomes an insignificant portion of the contract. A contract would also transfer to Level 2 if we began using a corroborated broker quote that has become available. Conversely, if a
corroborated broker quote ceases to be available or used by us, the contract would transfer from Level 2 to Level 3. There were no material transfers in or out of Level 1.      Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors,
and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the options are classified as Level 2 or 3.   
  We use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid and ask prices). When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit
considerations, generally based on available market evidence.      The fair value hierarchy for our derivative assets and liabilities accounted
for at fair value on a recurring basis was:

   The derivative values above are based on analysis of each contract as the fundamental unit of account;
therefore, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are not reflected net where the right of setoff exists. Gains or losses from contracts in one level may be offset by gains or losses on contracts in another level or by changes
in values of physical contracts or positions that are not reflected in the table above.      As reflected in the table above, Level 3 activity was
not material.       Commodity Derivative Contracts   We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined product, natural gas, LNG,
natural gas liquids and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our
policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, we use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to balance physical systems, meet customer needs, manage price exposures on specific transactions, and do a
limited, immaterial amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. We also use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations,
storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be used to optimize these activities which may move our risk profile away from market average prices.   
  The fair value of commodity derivative assets and liabilities and the line items where they appear on our consolidated balance sheet were:   

Hedge accounting has not been used for any item in the table. The amounts shown are presented gross (i.e., without

   The table below summarizes our material net exposures resulting from outstanding commodity derivative
contracts. These financial and physical derivative contracts are primarily used to manage price exposures on our underlying operations. The underlying exposures may be from non-derivative positions such as inventory volumes or firm natural gas
transport contracts. Financial derivative contracts may also offset physical derivative contracts, such as forward sales contracts.       

Interest Rate Derivative Contracts   During the second quarter of 2010, we executed interest rate swaps to synthetically
convert $500 million of our 4.60% fixed-rate notes due in 2015 to a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting. The
short-cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness.   
  The adjustments to the fair values of the interest rate swaps and hedged debt have not been material.   
   Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives   We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not
comprehensively hedge the exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments,
dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.      The fair value of foreign
currency exchange derivative assets and liabilities, and the line items where they appear on our consolidated balance sheet were:       

     Hedge accounting has not been used for any item in the table. The amounts shown are presented gross.

   We had the following net notional position of outstanding foreign currency exchange derivatives:   

*Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euros (EUR).    
     **Primarily euro, Canadian dollar, Norwegian krone and British pound.        ***Primarily Norwegian krone and British pound.    
    Credit Risk       Financial
instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, OTC derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper,
money market funds, government debt securities and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.      The credit risk
from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when
appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin
requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.   
  Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our
exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require collateral
to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed
by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due us.      Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post
collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically
decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit
as collateral.      The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a
liability position on December 31, 2011, was $237 million, for which $3 million of collateral was posted. If our credit rating were lowered one level from its  A  rating (per Standard and Poor s) on December 31, 2011, we
would be required to post no additional collateral to our counterparties. If we were downgraded below investment grade, we would be required to post $234 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.

    Fair Values of Financial Instruments       We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:       

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.

Accounts and notes receivable: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.      

Investment in LUKOIL shares: We completed the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL during the first quarter of 2011. At December 31, 2010, our
investment in LUKOIL was carried at fair value of $1,083 million, reflecting a closing price of LUKOIL ADRs on the London Stock Exchange of $56.50 per share.      

Debt: The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is estimated based on quoted market
prices.      

Fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation: Fair value is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows,
discounted at December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, using effective yield rates of 1.24 percent and 1.87 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of similar average duration adjusted for our average
credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal. See Note 13 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, for additional information.      

Commodity swaps: Fair value is estimated based on forward market prices and approximates the exit price at period end. When forward market prices are
not available, fair value is estimated using the forward prices of a similar commodity with adjustments for differences in quality or location.      

Futures: Fair values are based on quoted market prices obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) Futures, or
other traded exchanges.      

Interest rate swap contracts: Fair value is estimated based on a pricing model and market-observable interest rate swap curves obtained from a
third-party market data provider.      

Forward-exchange contracts: Fair values are estimated by comparing the contract rate to the forward rates in effect at the end of the respective
reporting periods, and approximate the exit prices at those dates.         Our commodity derivative and financial instruments were:

The amounts shown for derivatives in the preceding table are presented net (i.e., assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are
netted where the right of setoff exists). In addition, the December 31, 2011, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of no obligations to return cash collateral and $244 million of rights to reclaim cash collateral. The
December 31, 2010, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of $5 million of obligations to return cash collateral and $324 million of rights to reclaim cash collateral, respectively. No collateral was deposited or held for
the foreign currency derivatives or interest rate derivatives.

Note 17 Equity    
    Common Stock       The
changes in our shares of common stock, as categorized in the equity section of the balance sheet, were:       

Preferred Stock       We
have authorized 500 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, none of which was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010.       Noncontrolling Interests       At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had outstanding $510
million and $547 million, respectively, of equity in less-than-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest owners. The noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The
largest of these, amounting to $482 million and $520 million at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, was related to Darwin LNG operations, located in Australia s Northern Territory.   
   Preferred Share Purchase Rights       In
2002, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and directed the issuance of one right per common share for any newly issued shares. The rights
have certain anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire ConocoPhillips on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. However, since the rights may either be redeemed or
otherwise made inapplicable by ConocoPhillips prior to an acquirer obtaining beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips  common stock, the rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the
Board of Directors prior to that occurrence. The rights, which expire June 30, 2012, will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the company s common stock or commences a tender offer that would result in
ownership of 15 percent or more of the common stock. Each right would entitle stockholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of $300. If an acquirer obtains 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips 
common stock, then each right will be adjusted so that it will entitle the holder (other than the acquirer, whose rights will become void) to purchase, for the then exercise price, a number of shares of ConocoPhillips  common stock equal in
value to two times the exercise price of the right. In addition, the rights enable holders to purchase the stock of an acquiring company at a discount, depending on specific circumstances. We may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, for one
cent per right.

Note 18 Non-Mineral Leases    
   The company leases ocean transport vessels, tugboats, barges, pipelines, railcars, corporate aircraft, service stations, drilling
equipment, computers, office buildings and other facilities and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased
property for the fair market value at the end of the lease term. There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the leasing agreements with regard to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing ability. Leased assets under capital leases were
not significant in any period presented.      At December 31, 2011, future minimum rental payments due under noncancelable leases were:

*Includes $64 million related to subleases to related parties.    
   Operating lease rental expense for the years ended December 31 was:   

*Includes $35 million, $22 million and $21 million of contingent rentals in 2011,

For our tax-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, the
accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan assets were $8,481 million, $7,377 million, and $6,098 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and $7,661 million, $6,718 million, and $5,706 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2010.      For our unfunded nonqualified key employee supplemental pension plans, the projected benefit
obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation were $499 million and $374 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and were $479 million and $407 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.   
  The components of net periodic benefit cost of all defined benefit plans are presented in the following table:   

119

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   We recognized pension settlement losses of $21 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2009. None were recognized
in 2010.      We recognized special termination benefits of $5 million in 2009. None were recognized in 2011 and 2010.   
  In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average remaining
service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.      We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and company
contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 7.75 percent in 2012 that declines to 5 percent by
2023. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would be immaterial to ConocoPhillips.       Plan
Assets  We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes, investment managers, and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are
considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to
time. The target allocations for plan assets are 56 percent equity securities, 35 percent debt securities, 6 percent real estate and 3 percent in all other types of investments. Generally, the investments in the plans are publicly traded,
therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.      Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan
assets. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2011 and 2010.       

Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 1 are primarily based on quoted market prices.

Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 2 are estimated
using recently executed transactions and market price quotations. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair market value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other
securities with actual market prices. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades and
issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.          

Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.

Fair values of mutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.      

Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of cash equivalents categorized in Level 2 are valued using observable yield curves,
discounting and interest rates.          

Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives classified in Level 2, the
values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-party sources.          

Private equity funds are valued at net asset value as determined by the issuer based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
     
         120

Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the Plans 
participants.          

Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party
sources and sales comparables where available.          

A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract. This participating interest is calculated
as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The participation interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a
combination of comparison to quoted market prices and estimation using recently executed transactions and market price quotations for contract assets, and an actuarial present value computation for contract obligations. At December 31, 2011,
the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $144 million and consisted of $391 million in debt securities, less $247 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December 31, 2010, the
participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $92 million and consisted of $357 million in debt securities, less $265 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The net change from 2010 to 2011
is due to an increase in the fair market value of the underlying investments of $34 million and a decrease in the present value of the contract obligation of $18 million. The participating interest is not available for meeting general pension
benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

   Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2012, we expect to contribute approximately $690 million to our domestic
qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans and $235 million to our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.      The following benefit payments, which are exclusive of amounts to be paid from the participating annuity contract and which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

Defined Contribution Plans       Most U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP). Employees can deposit up to 75 percent of their eligible pay up to the statutory limit ($16,500 in 2011) in the
thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 39 investment funds. ConocoPhillips matches contribution deposits, up to 1.25 percent of eligible pay. Company contributions charged to expense for the CPSP and predecessor plans,
excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below), were $25 million in 2011, $24 million in 2010, and $23 million in 2009.      The stock
savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Employees may elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of eligible pay and receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate
to the amount of contribution.      In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings feature of the
CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of company common stock. Since the company guarantees the CPSP s borrowings, the unpaid balance is reported as a liability of the company and unearned compensation is
shown as a reduction of common stockholders  equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common stock held by the
plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service payments on CPSP borrowings. In addition, during the period from 2012 through
2014, when no debt principal payments are scheduled to occur, we have committed to make direct contributions of stock to the stock savings feature of the CPSP, or make prepayments on CPSP borrowings, to ensure a certain minimum level of stock
allocation to participant accounts.      We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair market value of the
stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to the stock savings feature of $77 million, $92 million and $83 million in 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively, all of which was compensation expense. In 2011, we made cash contributions to the CPSP of $4 million. No cash contributions were made in 2010 and 2009. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we contributed 660,755 shares, 1,776,873
shares and 2,018,692 shares, respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits Trust. The shares had a fair market value of $84 million, $103 million and $94 million, respectively. Also in 2011, we
contributed 475,696 shares of company common stock from Treasury stock. Dividends used to service debt were $45 million, $41 million and $39 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of
compensation expense recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively.   
         123

   The total CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December 31 were:   

The fair value of unallocated shares at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was $59 million and $231 million, respectively.
     We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and eligibility depending on location.
Total compensation expense recognized for these international plans was approximately $56 million in 2011, $52 million in 2010 and $51 million in 2009.       Share-Based Compensation Plans       The 2011 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of
ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2011. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 100 million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees, directors and consultants; however, as of
the effective date of the Plan, (i) any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii) any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are
canceled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Of the
100 million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40 million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options, and no more than 40 million shares are available for awards in stock.   
  Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award)
for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement. For share-based awards granted prior to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), codified into FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation Stock
Compensation,  we recognize expense over the period of time during which the employee earns the award, accelerating the recognition of expense only when an employee actually retires. For share-based awards granted after our adoption of ASC 718
on January 1, 2006, we recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an
employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture.      Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). For awards granted
prior to our adoption of ASC 718 that vest ratably, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separate vesting portion of the award (i.e., as if the award was multiple awards with different requisite service
periods). For share-based awards granted after our adoption of ASC 718, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.   
         124

   Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income and the associated tax benefit for the years
ended December 31, were as follows:       

Stock Options  Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and earlier plans permit purchase of our common stock
at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable
on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period.
     The following summarizes our stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2011:   

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of vested options and exercisable options at December 31, 2011, was 3.95 years and
3.4 years, respectively.      During 2011, we received $197 million in cash and realized a tax benefit of $119 million from the exercise of
options. At December 31, 2011, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $16 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 19 months, the longest period being 25 months.   
         125

   The significant assumptions used to calculate the fair market values of the options granted over the past
three years, as calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, were as follows:       

    The ranges in the assumptions used were as follows:   

We calculate volatility using the most recent ConocoPhillips end-of-week closing stock prices spanning a period equal to the expected
life of the options granted. We periodically calculate the average period of time lapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants to estimate the expected life of new option grants.   
   Stock Unit Program  Generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the Plan and vest ratably, with one-third
of the units vesting in 36 months, one-third vesting in 48 months, and the final third vesting 60 months from the date of grant. In addition to these regularly scheduled annual awards, restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or
retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units vest vary by award. Upon vesting, the units are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to employees already
eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those units are not issued as shares until the end of the normal vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend
equivalent that is charged to expense. The grant date fair value of these units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while
unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.   
         126

   The following summarizes our stock unit activity for the three years ended December 31, 2011:

At December 31, 2011, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested units was $188 million, which will be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 30 months, the longest period being 100 months.       Performance Share Program  Under
the Plan, we also annually grant to senior management restricted performance share units (PSUs) that do not vest until either (i) with respect to awards for performance periods beginning before 2009, the employee becomes eligible for retirement
by reaching age 55 with five years of service or (ii) with respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009, five years after the grant date of the award (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until
retirement after reaching age 55 with five years of service), so we recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the date of grant and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are authorized three years
prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for such retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. These PSUs are settled
by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Until issued as stock, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. In its current form, the first grant of PSUs under this
program was in 2006.

   The following summarizes our Performance Share Program activity for the three years ended December 31,
2011:       

At December 31, 2011, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested Performance Share awards was $27 million, which
will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 46 months, the longest period being 15 years.       Other      In
addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were either issued to replace awards held by employees of companies we acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that
has been discontinued. Generally, the recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.   
         128

   The following summarizes the aggregate activity of these restricted shares and units for the three years
ended December 31, 2011:       

At December 31, 2011, there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested units.   
   Compensation and Benefits Trust       The
Compensation and Benefits Trust (CBT) was an irrevocable grantor trust, administered by an independent trustee and designed to acquire, hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund certain future compensation and benefit obligations of the
company. The trustee voted shares held by the CBT in accordance with voting directions from eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement with the trustee. We sold 58.4 million shares of previously unissued company common stock to the
CBT in 1995 for $37 million of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us, and a promissory note from the CBT to us of $952 million. The CBT was consolidated by ConocoPhillips; therefore, the cash contribution and promissory note were
eliminated in consolidation. Shares held by the CBT were valued at cost and did not affect earnings per share or total common stockholders  equity until after they were transferred out of the CBT. In 2010, 1,776,873 shares were transferred
out of the CBT.      In August 2011, all of the approximately 36 million shares of company common stock held by the CBT were transferred to
ConocoPhillips, and those shares are now held as non-voting treasury stock. Because the CBT was consolidated by us, the transfer of its shares from  Grantor trusts  to  Treasury stock  in the equity section of our balance sheet
was recorded at the shares  historical carrying value of $610 million. This transfer did not affect total equity, shares outstanding, or earnings per share. The CBT no longer holds any assets. Two smaller grantor trusts also disposed of all
their shares of company stock during 2011.

Note 20 Income Taxes    
   Income taxes charged to income were:       

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. Major components of deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31 were:       

Current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities included deferred taxes of $788 million, $183
million, $9 million and $18,055 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and $562 million, $160 million, $21 million and $17,335 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.   
  We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire between 2012 and 2031 with some carryovers having
indefinite carryforward periods.   
         130

   Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely
than not, be realized. During 2011, valuation allowances increased a total of $87 million. This reflects increases of $174 million primarily related to U.S. foreign tax credit and foreign loss carryforwards, partially offset by decreases
of $87 million, primarily related to utilization of U.S. foreign tax credit and state loss carryforwards, currency effects and asset relinquishment. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning
strategies, management expects remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income.   
  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures
totaled approximately $4,227 million and $4,134 million, respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income if distributed.      The following table shows a
reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits for 2011, 2010 and 2009:       

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $815 million, $914 million and $931 million,
respectively, which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.      At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, accrued liabilities for
interest and penalties totaled $141 million, $171 million and $166 million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in a charge to earnings in 2011 of $10 million, a benefit to earnings in 2010 of $2
million, and a charge to earnings in 2009 of $18 million.      We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in
many foreign and state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2008), Canada (2005), United States (2006) and Norway (2010). Issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent
years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably
possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.   
         131

   The amounts of U.S. and foreign income before income taxes, with a reconciliation of tax at the federal
statutory rate with the provision for income taxes, were:       

During 2011, we recognized a significant tax capital loss on disposition of the legal entity which ultimately holds the Wilhelmshaven
Refinery assets. A large portion of the tax benefit of this loss was realized in 2011 because of other capital gains that occurred.      The
change in the effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011was primarily due to the effect of asset dispositions occurring in 2010, partially offset by asset impairments occurring in 2010.      In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on July 19, 2011, which increased the supplementary corporate tax rate applicable to U.K. Upstream activity from 20 to 32 percent, retroactively
effective from March 24, 2011. This resulted in the overall U.K. corporate rate increasing from 50 percent to 62 percent. The enactment resulted in increased income tax expense of $316 million in 2011. This is comprised of $106 million due
to remeasurement of U.K. deferred tax liabilities, and $210 million to reflect the new rate from March 24, 2011, through the end of the year. Statutory tax rate changes did not have a significant impact on our income tax expense in 2010 or
2009.

Note 24 Related Party Transactions    
   Significant transactions with related parties were:       

(a)  
  We sold natural gas to DCP Midstream and crude oil to the Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bhd. (MRC), among others, for processing and marketing. Natural gas liquids,
solvents and petrochemical feedstocks were sold to CPChem, gas oil and hydrogen feedstocks were sold to Excel Paralubes and refined products were sold primarily to CFJ Properties and LUKOIL. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, CFJ was no
longer considered a related party due to the sale of our interest. Natural gas, crude oil, blendstock and other intermediate products were sold to WRB. In addition, we charged several of our affiliates, including CPChem and MSLP, for the use of
common facilities, such as steam generators, waste and water treaters and warehouse facilities.         

(b)  
  In 2011, we sold the Seaway Products Pipeline to DCP Midstream for cash proceeds of $400 million, resulting in a before-tax gain of $156 million. During 2010, we
sold a portion of our LUKOIL shares under a stock purchase and option agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of LUKOIL, resulting in a before-tax gain of $1,149 million.     

(c)  
  We purchased refined products from WRB. We purchased natural gas and natural gas liquids from DCP Midstream and CPChem for use in our refinery processes and other
feedstocks from various affiliates. We purchased crude oil from LUKOIL and refined products from MRC. We also paid fees to various pipeline equity companies for transporting finished refined products and natural gas, as well as a price upgrade to
MSLP for heavy crude processing. We purchased base oils and fuel products from Excel Paralubes for use in our refinery and specialty businesses.         

(d)  
  We paid processing fees to various affiliates. Additionally, we paid transportation fees to pipeline equity companies.     

(e)  
  We paid and/or received interest to/from various affiliates, including FCCL. See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information on
loans to affiliated companies.     
   Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, transactions with LUKOIL and its subsidiaries were no longer considered related party
transactions. See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information.

Note 25 Segment Disclosures and Related Information    
   We have organized our reporting structure based on the grouping of similar products and services, resulting in six operating segments:

1)  
   E P  This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide
basis. At December 31, 2011, our E P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia.
The E P segment s U.S. and international operations are disclosed separately for reporting purposes.         

2)  
   Midstream  This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids,
predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream.         

3)  
   R M  This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. At
December 31, 2011, we owned or had an interest in 12 refineries in the United States, one in the United Kingdom, one in Ireland, one in Germany and one in Malaysia. The R M segment s U.S. and international operations are disclosed
separately for reporting purposes.         

4)  
   LUKOIL Investment  This segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company
headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.         

5)  
   Chemicals  This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent
equity investment in CPChem.         

6)  
   Emerging Businesses  This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this
segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment.
       Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead, most interest expense and various other corporate activities.
Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.      We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on
net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Segment accounting policies are the same as those in Note 1 Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.

    Note 26 Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses    
   On July 14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and
transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation
businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated
downstream company. The separation is to be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips shareholders on the record date for the share distribution.
     In October 2011, we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution
will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66 Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 2011, and an amendment
on January 3, 2012.      The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative
Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012.

Oil and Gas Operations  (Unaudited)      In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932,  Extractive Activities Oil and Gas,  and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.   
  These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates  oil and
gas activities, covering both those in our Exploration and Production (E P) segment, as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, for periods prior to 2011, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ
from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.      Our proved reserves include estimated quantities
related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under the  economic interest  method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve
quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At December 31, 2011, approximately 10 percent of our
total proved reserves were under PSCs, primarily in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area.      Our disclosures by geographic
area include the United States, Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and the United Kingdom), Russia, Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa and Other Areas. Other Areas primarily consists of the Caspian Region.   
  In the following disclosures, the synthetic oil classification included our past Syncrude mining operations, and the bitumen classification includes our
Surmont operations and the FCCL Partnership. In June 2010, we sold our interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture; accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, we no longer held synthetic oil reserves.   
  On July 28, 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL over a period of time through the end of 2011. As a result of
this sell down of our interest, at the end of the third quarter of 2010 we ceased using equity-method accounting for our investment in LUKOIL. Accordingly, the supplemental oil and gas disclosures reflect activity for LUKOIL through June 30,
2010, which, on a lag basis, results in three quarters of activity being included in the year 2010 (the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010). Since the proved reserves tables are not on a lag basis, they reflect activity for
the first three quarters of 2010, at which point LUKOIL s reserves were removed from our reserve quantities.        Reserves
Governance        The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB.
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under
existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether
deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved reserves
are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required
equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped
reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.   
         140

  Index to Financial Statements  

   We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and
reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers in our E P business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business unit s reserves are reviewed annually by an
internal team which is headed by the company s Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geologists and finance personnel, reviews the business units  reserves for adherence to SEC
guidelines and company policy through on-site visits and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This
team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management and our internal audit group. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for
internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.   
  The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the company s reserve estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance
and Reporting. This individual is a petroleum engineer with a bachelor s degree in petroleum engineering. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) with over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience, including
drilling and production engineering assignments in several field locations. He is currently serving a three-year term on the Oil   Gas Reserves Committee of the SPE and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir
engineering, reserves reporting and compliance, and business management.      During 2011, our processes and controls used to assess over 90
percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2011, were reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of
our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips  technical staff presented D M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the
methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating
procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management s intent in retaining D M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D M s opinion was that the general
processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2011, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D M s report is included as Exhibit 99 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.      Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the  Critical
Accounting Estimates  section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

Notable changes in proved crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2011,
included:       

Extensions and discoveries  : In 2011, extensions and discoveries in Europe were primarily due to the sanctioning of the Ekofisk South and
Clair Ridge development projects in the North Sea.          

Sales  : In 2010, for our equity affiliates in Russia, sales were primarily due to the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL.

Natural gas production in the reserves table may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in our statistics
disclosure, primarily because the quantities above include gas consumed at the lease.      Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per
square inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.      Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December 31,
2011, included:       

Revisions  : In 2010, revisions in Alaska, Lower 48 and Canada were primarily due to higher prices in 2010, versus 2009, as well as
improved well performance. In 2009, revisions in Alaska were primarily due to higher prices in 2009, versus 2008. In 2009, for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, revisions resulted from modified coalbed methane drilling
plans in Australia. In Russia, revisions were attributable to positive performance in various LUKOIL fields.          

Extensions and discoveries  : In 2011, for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries were
primarily due to ongoing development drilling onshore Australia associated with the APLNG Project. In 2010, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 and Canada were primarily due to continued drilling success in various fields. In 2009, for our equity
affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries primarily resulted from drilling success in Australia related to a coalbed methane project.      

Sales  : In 2010, for our equity affiliates in Russia, sales were primarily due to the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL.

Notable changes in proved synthetic oil and bitumen reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2011, included:

Revisions  : In 2011, for our bitumen equity operations, revisions were primarily due to new subsurface interpretations, as well as the
effects of higher prices on sliding scale royalty provisions. In 2009, for synthetic oil consolidated operations, revisions reflect our Syncrude Canada Ltd. operations. For our bitumen consolidated operations, revisions primarily were related to the
sanction of the Surmont Phase II Project. For our bitumen equity affiliate operations, revisions were mainly the result of the effect of higher prices on sliding scale royalty provisions.      

Extensions and discoveries  : In 2011, for our consolidated operations, extensions and discoveries were related to continued development of
Surmont. For our equity affiliate operations, extensions and discoveries were related to the sanctioning of new projects in FCCL. In 2009, for our bitumen consolidated operations, extensions and discoveries were related to the sanction of the
Surmont Phase II Project. In 2010 and 2009, for our equity affiliate operations, extensions and discoveries mainly reflect the continued development of FCCL.      

Sales  : In 2010, for synthetic oil consolidated operations, sales reflect the disposition of our interest in Syncrude.

  Index to Financial Statements  

Natural gas reserves are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of
natural gas converts to one BOE.        Proved Undeveloped Reserves        We had 2,465 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011, compared with 2,217 million BOE at year-end 2010. We converted 210 million BOE of undeveloped reserves to developed
during 2011 as we achieved startup of major development projects. In addition, we added 458 million BOE of undeveloped reserves in 2011 mainly through exploratory success and revisions. As a result, at December 31, 2011, our proved
undeveloped reserves represented 29 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 27 percent at December 31, 2010. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2011, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were
$4.5 billion.      Approximately 70 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011 were associated with eight major
development areas. Seven of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or
upgraded, and include:       

FCCL oil sands Foster Creek and Christina Lake in Canada.      

The Surmont oil sands project in Canada.      

The Ekofisk Field in the North Sea.      

Certain fields in the Lower 48 and Alaska.         The remaining major project, the Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan, will have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed as this project begins production.   
         149

Table of Contents  

  Index to Financial Statements  

   At the end of 2011, we did not have any material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves in individual fields
or countries that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. However, our largest concentrations of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011 are located in the Athabasca oil sands in Canada, consisting of the FCCL and Surmont
steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects. The majority of our proved undeveloped reserves in this area were first recorded in 2006 and 2007, and we expect a material portion of these reserves will remain undeveloped for more than five years.
     Our SAGD projects are large, multi-year projects with steady, long-term production at consistent levels. The associated reserves are expected
to be developed over many years as additional well pairs are drilled across the extensive resource base to maintain throughput at the central processing facilities.        Results of Operations        The company s results of operations from oil and gas
activities for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 are shown in the following tables. Additional information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:   

Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous
income.          

Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.      

Depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.      

Transportation costs include costs to transport our produced hydrocarbons to their points of sale, as well as processing fees paid to process natural
gas to natural gas liquids. The profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are deemed to be outside oil and gas producing activities. The net income of the transportation operations is included in other
earnings.          

Other related expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous expenses.      

Other earnings include non-oil and gas activities within the E P segment, such as pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations,
and crude oil and gas marketing activities.

     Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve
Quantities        In accordance with SEC and FASB requirements, amounts were computed using 12-month average prices and end-of-year costs
(adjusted only for existing contractual changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor. Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price
for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as
new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing and amount of
future development, including dismantlement, and production costs.      While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this
data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.       Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

reserves.          **Includes taxes other than income taxes.        ***Includes amounts resulting from changes in the timing of production.        

The net change in prices, and production and transportation costs is the beginning-of-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual
change in the per-unit sales price, and production and transportation cost, discounted at 10 percent.          

Purchases and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions, discoveries and improved recovery, are calculated using production forecasts of the
applicable reserve quantities for the year multiplied by the 12-month average sales prices, less future estimated costs, discounted at 10 percent.      

The accretion of discount is 10 percent of the prior year s discounted future cash inflows, less future production, transportation and development
costs.          

The net change in income taxes is the annual change in the discounted future income tax provisions.

Supplementary Information Condensed Consolidating Financial Information    
   We have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company, ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company,
ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, with respect to publicly held debt securities. ConocoPhillips Company is wholly owned by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company, ConocoPhillips
Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II are indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of
ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, with respect to their publicly held debt securities. Similarly, ConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally guaranteed
the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities. In addition, ConocoPhillips Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly
held debt securities. All guarantees are joint and several. The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for:   

ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company, ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, and ConocoPhillips Canada
Funding Company II (in each case, reflecting investments in subsidiaries utilizing the equity method of accounting).      

All other nonguarantor subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.      

The consolidating adjustments necessary to present ConocoPhillips  results on a consolidated basis.      
  In February 2009, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which ConocoPhillips, as a well-known seasoned issuer, has the
ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities, with certain debt securities guaranteed by ConocoPhillips Company. Also as part of that registration statement, ConocoPhillips Trust I and
ConocoPhillips Trust II have the ability to issue and sell preferred trust securities, guaranteed by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have not issued any trust-preferred securities under this registration statement,
and thus have no assets or liabilities. Accordingly, columns for these two trusts are not included in the condensed consolidating financial information.      This condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.

 REPORT OF DEGOLYER AND MACNAUGHTON.

Report of DeGolyer and MacNaughton. 

Exhibit 99       DeGolyer and MacNaughton       5001 Spring Valley Road   
  Suite 800 East      Dallas, Texas 75244
     February 21, 2012      ConocoPhillips      600 North Dairy Ashford      Houston, Texas 77079      Re: SEC Process Review   
  Ladies and Gentlemen:      Pursuant to your request, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has performed a process review of the processes and controls used within ConocoPhillips in preparing its internal estimates of proved reserves, as of
December 31, 2011. The process review, which is contemplated by Item 1202 (a) (8) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been performed specifically to address the adequacy and effectiveness of
ConocoPhillips  internal processes and controls relative to its estimation of proved reserves in compliance with Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC.   
  DeGolyer and MacNaughton has participated as an independent member of the internal ConocoPhillips Reserves Compliance
Assessment Team in reviews and discussions with each of the relevant ConocoPhillips business units relative to SEC proved reserves estimation. DeGolyer and MacNaughton participated in the review of all major fields in all countries where
ConocoPhillips has proved reserves worldwide, which ConocoPhillips has indicated represents over 90 percent of its estimated total proved reserves as of December 31, 2011.   
  The reviews with ConocoPhillips  technical staff involved presentations and discussions of a) basic reservoir data
including seismic data, well log data, pressure and production tests, core analysis, PVT data, and production history, b) technical methods employed in SEC proved reserves estimation, including performance analysis, geology, mapping, and volumetric
estimates, c) economic analysis, and d) commercial assessment, including the legal basis for the interest in the reserves,   

DeGolyer and MacNaughton

primarily related to lease agreements and other petroleum license agreements, such as concession and production sharing agreements.   
  A field examination of the properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this review of
ConocoPhillips  processes and controls.      It is our opinion that ConocoPhillips  estimates of proved
reserves for the properties reviewed were prepared by the use of recognized geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by
ConocoPhillips  experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history. It is our opinion that the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its
