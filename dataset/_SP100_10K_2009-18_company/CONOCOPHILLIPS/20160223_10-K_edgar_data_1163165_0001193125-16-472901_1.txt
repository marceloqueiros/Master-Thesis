    Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES   
    CORPORATE STRUCTURE   
 ConocoPhillips is the world s largest independent exploration and production (E P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and
natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.    In April 2012, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of our downstream business into an
independent, publicly traded energy company, Phillips 66. Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2012.
The separation was completed on April 30, 2012, and activities related to Phillips 66 have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the separation.  
 In 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigeria and Algeria businesses (collectively,
the  Disposition Group ). We sold our Nigeria business in the third quarter of 2014, and we sold Kashagan and our Algeria business in the fourth quarter of 2013. Results for the Disposition Group have been reported as discontinued
operations in all periods presented. For additional information on all discontinued operations, see Note 3 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 21 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing
major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio includes resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major
international developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.    At December 31, 2015, ConocoPhillips
employed approximately 15,900 people worldwide.    We are marketing certain non-core assets across all of our segments. For additional information on asset
sales, see the  Outlook  section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .

     SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION   
 Effective November 1, 2015, the Other International and historically presented Europe segments were restructured to align with changes to our internal
organization structure. The Libya business was moved from the Other International segment to the historically presented Europe segment, which is now renamed Europe and North Africa. Accordingly, results of operations for the Other International and
Europe and North Africa segments have been revised in all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the impact on our segment presentation is immaterial. For operating segment and geographic information,
see Note 24 Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.  
 We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At
December 31, 2015, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and Qatar.  
 The information listed below appears in the  Oil and Gas Operations  disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is
incorporated herein by reference:      

Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.    

Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.    

Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.    

Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).    

Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.    

Developed and undeveloped acreage.      The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information
included in the  Oil and Gas Operations  disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 84 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet (MCF) of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the following summary reserves table.

Table of Contents  

Total production from continuing operations was 1,589 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in 2015,
compared with 1,540 MBOED, including Libya, in 2014, an increase of 3 percent. The increase in total average production in 2015 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Gumusut
in Malaysia; APLNG in Australia; Greater Britannia projects and the J-Area in the U.K.; and the ramp-up of Foster Creek Phase F in Canada. Improved well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway, and lower turnaround activity
also contributed to higher production in 2015. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline. Production from continuing operations was 1,589 MBOED in 2015, compared with 1,532 MBOED in 2014, excluding Libya, an increase of 57 MBOED,
or 4 percent. Full-year production from assets sold or under agreement in 2015 was 64 MBOED.    Our total average realized price from continuing
operations was $34.34 per BOE in 2015, a decrease of 47 percent compared with $64.59 per BOE in 2014, which reflected lower average realized prices across all commodities. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price from continuing operations
decreased 48 percent in 2015, from $92.80 per barrel in 2014 to $48.26 per barrel in 2015. Additionally, our worldwide annual average natural gas liquids prices from continuing operations decreased 54 percent, from $38.99 per barrel in 2014 to
$17.79 per barrel in 2015. Our worldwide annual average natural gas price from continuing operations decreased 40 percent, from $6.57 per MCF in 2014 to $3.96 per MCF in 2015. Average annual bitumen prices also decreased 66 percent, from $55.13 per
barrel in 2014 to $18.72 per barrel in 2015.

    ALASKA  
 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. We are the largest crude oil
and natural gas producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America s largest oil fields located on Alaska s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine Field,
located on the Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska s largest owners of state and federal exploration leases, with approximately 0.7 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2015. Approximately 0.4 million of these
acres are located in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPRA) and the North Slope, and 0.3 million are located in the Chukchi Sea. In 2015, Alaska operations contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of
our natural gas production.      
    *Thousands of barrels per day.   
  **Millions of cubic feet per day.   
   Greater Prudhoe Area      The Greater Prudhoe Area
includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as
well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover natural gas liquids before reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and
Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.      Greater Kuparuk Area    
 We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located
40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells
and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.    Drill Site 2S, in the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field,
was sanctioned in October 2014. First oil was achieved in October 2015 with net peak production estimated at 5 MBOED in 2016.    The 1H Northeast West Sak
(NEWS) oil development targeting the West Sak reservoir in the Kuparuk River Unit, was sanctioned in March 2015. First production is anticipated in 2017.  
   Western North Slope      On the Western North Slope,
we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In October 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a new drill site which
extends the Alpine reservoir west into the NPRA. Net peak production is estimated at 10 MBOED in 2016.    The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit
established entirely within the NPRA, was formed in 2008. In 2015, we received permit approvals and sanctioning from the regulatory agencies for the Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT1) drill site. GMT1 is planned to be connected by road to the CD5 drill
site, and production

will be transported by pipeline to the existing Alpine facilities for processing. We are evaluating further exploration and development potential in the NPRA.  
   Cook Inlet Area      We operate the North Cook Inlet
Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit and the Kenai LNG Facility, while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Our share of production from
the units is primarily sold to local utilities and is also used to supply feedstock to the Kenai LNG Plant.    The Kenai LNG Facility includes a
1.6 million-tons-per-year capacity plant, as well as docking and loading facilities for LNG tankers. LNG from the plant has historically been transported and sold to utility companies in Japan. The plant was idled in late-2012; however, due to
a change in market conditions, including additional gas supplies, we were granted a two-year export license from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in April 2014 to export up to 40 billion cubic feet of LNG from the facility. As a result, we
shipped six cargoes of LNG from the Kenai Facility to Asia in 2015. In February 2016, our export license was renewed for an additional two years.    In the
first quarter of 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in the Beluga River Unit natural gas field in the Cook Inlet Area. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.  
   Point Thomson      We own a 5 percent interest in the
Point Thomson Unit, which is located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An initial production system is anticipated to be online by second quarter 2016, which is estimated to send 400 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED) of
condensate through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).      Alaska LNG (AKLNG)    
 During 2012, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and TransCanada Corporation (collectively, the  AKLNG co-venturers ),
began evaluating a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from Alaska s North Slope and deliver it to market. The AKLNG Project concept is an integrated LNG project consisting of a liquefaction plant, including marine
terminal facilities and auxiliary marine vessels, located in south-central Alaska; a natural gas treatment plant, located on the North Slope; and an estimated 800-mile natural gas pipeline, which would connect the two plants.  
 The proposed AKLNG natural gas liquefaction plant and terminal would be located in the Nikiski area on the Kenai Peninsula, approximately 60 miles southwest
of Anchorage, along the Cook Inlet. In January 2014, the AKLNG co-venturers, the Commissioners of the Alaska Departments of Revenue and Natural Resources, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned corporation, signed a
Heads of Agreement (HOA) for the AKLNG Project. The HOA provides a roadmap of how the parties intend to progress the project, including proposed terms for participation by the State of Alaska as an equity owner, proposed fiscal and regulatory terms,
and proposed terms for expansion of project components. During 2014, general legislation was enacted by the State of Alaska, and a joint venture agreement for the preliminary front-end engineering and design phase of the project was executed. The
AKLNG Project will require several major federal permits, and in July 2014, an application for an LNG export license was filed with the U.S. DOE to export up to 20 million metric tons a year of LNG for 30 years. In November 2014 and June 2015,
the U.S. DOE authorized the export of LNG to free trade agreement (FTA) and non-FTA countries, respectively. In September 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) accepted the project into pre-file status, which initiates the lengthy
environmental and safety reviews required to design, permit, construct and operate the plants and pipeline. In March 2015, the FERC issued their Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement for AKLNG and begin the National
Environmental Policy Act period to seek public comment. In October 2015, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (AOGCC) issued orders for gas offtake at Prudhoe Bay and Point Thomson. In December 2015, AGDC acquired the interest in the AKLNG
Project previously held by TransCanada Corporation. On December 31, 2015 the HOA expired by its own terms. Commercial negotiations and planning for front-end engineering and design are ongoing.

  Significant engineering, technical, regulatory, fiscal, commercial and permitting issues would need to be
resolved prior to a final investment decision on the potential $45 billion to $65 billion (gross) project.      Exploration    
 We plan to drill two to three exploration wells in 2016 in the NPRA.  
 Our plans to drill an exploration well in the Chukchi Sea have been cancelled due to the current market environment, regulatory uncertainty and expiry of the
primary lease term in 2020. As a result, we recorded a $406 million after-tax charge for leasehold and capitalized interest impairment and dry hole expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
   Transportation      We transport the petroleum liquids
produced on the North Slope to south central Alaska through an  800-mile  pipeline that is part of TAPS. We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the
Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.    Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our
North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers primarily deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, to refineries on the west coast of the United States.  
   LOWER 48    The Lower 48 segment
consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 business is organized within three regions covering the Gulf Coast,  Mid-Continent  and
Rockies. As a result of tight oil opportunities, we have directed our investments toward certain shorter cycle time, low cost-of-supply plays. In July 2015, we announced our plan to reduce future deepwater exploration spending and terminated our
Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco. We hold 14.3 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2015, the Lower 48 contributed 33 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of our natural gas
production.      
 
      6  

Table of Contents  

    Onshore    
 We hold 12.4 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held by production or
owned by the company. Our unconventional holdings total approximately 2.6 million net acres in the following areas:      

900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado.    

617,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and eastern Montana.    

102,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.    

61,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas.    
   The majority of our 2015 onshore production
originated from the Eagle Ford, San Juan, Permian and Bakken. Onshore activities in 2015 were centered mostly on continued development of emerging and existing assets, with an emphasis on areas with low cost of supply, particularly in growing
unconventional plays. The 2015 drilling activity levels declined relative to 2014 due to reduced capital spending in the low commodity price environment. Our major focus areas in 2015 included the following:  

Eagle Ford The Eagle Ford continued full field development in 2015, with the majority of the development program being drilled on multi-well pads. We operated six rigs on average in 2015, resulting in 136 operated
wells drilled and 150 operated wells brought online. In 2015, we also increased production by 12 percent compared with 2014 and achieved net peak production of 190 MBOED, compared with 179 MBOED in 2014.    

Bakken We operated five rigs on average throughout the year in the Bakken. We continued our pad drilling efficiency, drilling 89 operated wells during the year and bringing 128 operated wells online. As a result,
we achieved net peak production of 80 MBOED in 2015, compared with 63 MBOED in 2014.    

San Juan Basin The San Juan Basin includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 20 percent natural gas liquids, as well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production.
We hold approximately 1.3 million net acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, where we continue to pursue select conventional development opportunities. This also includes approximately 900,000 net unconventional acres of lease
rights.    

Permian Basin The Permian Basin is another area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology
should also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1.0 million net acres in the Permian, which includes 102,000 net unconventional acres.    
 In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of certain non-core assets in East Texas and North Louisiana and South Texas. Production from the assets
sold was 33 MBOED, approximately 6 percent of the total Lower 48 segment production in 2015.      Gulf of Mexico    
 At year-end 2015, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by
co-venturers, including:      

15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.    

15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.    

12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.

    Exploration        

Conventional Exploration        In the third quarter of 2015, we decided not to conduct
further activity on certain Gulf of Mexico leases. At December 31, 2015, we held approximately 1.8 million net acres in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.  
 During 2015, we conducted appraisal drilling at Shenandoah, Tiber, and Gila. The nonoperated Gibson exploration and Tiber appraisal wells, and
the ConocoPhillips operated Melmar exploration well are currently drilling.   We own a 30 percent nonoperated working interest in the
Shenandoah discovery, which was announced in 2009. The third Shenandoah down dip appraisal well was spud in 2015, and planning is underway for the next appraisal well, which is expected to spud in the first half of 2016.  
 The operated Harrier and nonoperated Vernaccia wells were expensed as dry holes in 2015. The operator of the Gila prospect has elected to
discontinue exploration and appraisal activity. Accordingly, we recorded $111 million in after-tax dry hole expense for a previously suspended well in the Gila prospect, and a $100 million charge for the impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs.

Unconventional Exploration        Our onshore focus areas include the Niobrara in the
Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs in the Delaware Basin, as well as several emerging plays. In 2015, we drilled 21 unconventional wells in the Delaware Basin. We continue to assess and appraise this and other
unconventional opportunities.     Facilities   
   Freeport LNG Terminal      In July 2013, we agreed with
Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to terminate our long-term agreement to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeport s 1.5 billion cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. The termination
agreement conditions were satisfied in 2014. Our terminal regasification capacity has been reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day until July 1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a
result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60 million per year in costs over the next 17 years. For additional information, see Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.     Golden Pass LNG Terminal    
 We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline, with a combined net book value of approximately
$273 million at December 31, 2015. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline capacity for the
receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3) and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Utilization of the terminal has
been and is expected to be limited, as market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets. As a result, we are evaluating opportunities to optimize the value of the terminal facilities.  
   Great Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust      We hold
the interest in the Great Northern Iron Ore Properties trust (the Trust), a grantor trust that owns mineral and surface interests in the Mesabi Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota and certain other personal property. Pursuant to the terms of
the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminated on April 6, 2015. At the end of the wind-down period, documents memorializing our ownership of certain Trust property, including all of the  
      8  

Table of Contents  

  Trust s mineral properties and active leases, will be delivered to us. The Trustees currently
anticipate the wind-down process, final distribution and dissolution of the Trust will be completed by the end of 2016. At that time, we expect to recognize the fair value of the Trust s net assets transferred to us.  
   Other        

San Juan Gas Plant We operate and own a 50 percent interest in the San Juan Gas Plant, a 550 million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing plant in Bloomfield, New Mexico.

Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility We operate and own the Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility, a 15,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas.    
   CANADA    Our Canadian operations
mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2015, operations in Canada contributed 21 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our natural
gas production.      
     Western Canada    
 Our operations in western Canada extend across Alberta and British Columbia. We operate or have ownership interests in approximately 50 natural gas processing
plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2015, held leasehold rights in 3.2 million net acres in western Canada. Our investments in 2015 were focused mainly on opportunities in the following three core development areas:  

Deep Basin We hold leasehold rights in 1.4 million net acres in the Deep Basin, located in northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia. In 2015, Deep Basin achieved average net production of
48 MBOED, and we drilled 13 horizontal wells.    

Kaybob-Edson We hold leasehold rights in 0.8 million net acres in the Kaybob-Edson Area, located south of the Deep Basin in west central Alberta. Net production for Kaybob-Edson averaged 45 MBOED in 2015,
and we drilled 15 horizontal wells.    

Clearwater Located in west central Alberta, south of Kaybob-Edson, we hold 0.9 million net acres of leasehold rights. In 2015, average net production for Clearwater was 40 MBOED, and we drilled
11 horizontal wells.    
      9  

Table of Contents  

  Assets located outside these development areas are focused on production optimization. In the fourth quarter of
2015, we finalized sales of certain non-core assets in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Production from the assets sold was 27 MBOED, approximately 9 percent of the total Canada segment production in 2015. At December 31, 2015, the
company held 0.1 million net acres of leasehold rights in these areas.      Oil Sands    
 We hold approximately 0.9 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an
enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.  

Surmont The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. Surmont 2 construction began in 2010, and achieved first
production in the third quarter of 2015. Surmont s gross production capacity is estimated to be 150 MBOED.    

FCCL  FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, is a 50/50 heavy oil business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. FCCL s assets are operated by Cenovus and include the Foster Creek, Christina
Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen developments. FCCL continues to progress development plans for each of these assets, including near-term completion of phase expansions as detailed below:    

Foster Creek        Foster Creek is located approximately 200 miles northeast of
Edmonton, Alberta. There are six producing phases at Foster Creek, Phases A through F, with construction continuing on Phase G. Net production at Foster Creek increased approximately 12 MBOED, mainly as a result of a continued ramp up toward full
capacity. In the fourth quarter of 2014, FCCL received regulatory approval for Phase J.      

Christina Lake        Christina Lake is located approximately 75 miles south of Fort
McMurray, Alberta. There are five producing phases at Christina Lake, Phases A through E, with construction continuing on Phase F. In late 2015, an optimization project was completed at Christina Lake that increased gross production capacity to 160
MBOED, with incremental production expected to ramp up during 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, regulatory approval was received for Phase H development.      

Narrows Lake         Narrows Lake Phase A, was sanctioned in late 2012 and is
expected to have 45 MBOED of production capacity; however, construction has been deferred.      Exploration    
 We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: onshore western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic
Islands. Our primary exploration focus is on unconventional plays in western Canada and conventional exploration offshore eastern Canada.      

Conventional Exploration        During 2014, we entered into a farm-in agreement to
acquire a 30 percent nonoperated interest in six exploration licenses covering approximately five million gross acres in the deepwater Shelburne Basin, offshore Nova Scotia. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we spudded the first of two exploration well
commitments in offshore Nova Scotia. The second exploration well is anticipated to begin drilling in the second quarter of 2016. In December 2014, we participated in a successful bid for one  
      10  

Table of Contents  

  exploration license covering 0.7 million gross acres located in the Flemish Pass Basin,
offshore Newfoundland. In January 2015, we were awarded the license, in which we hold a 30 percent nonoperated interest. Seismic surveys of the subsurface were completed in 2015.  

Unconventional Exploration        We hold approximately 0.7 million net acres in
the emerging Montney, Muskwa, Duvernay and Canol unconventional plays in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. During 2015, we completed a lease swap and continued to drill exploration and appraisal wells in the
Montney play, which extends from British Columbia into Alberta.    In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded dry hole expense of $185 million after-tax
associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties, and an impairment charge of $75 million after-tax for unproved properties in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas.  
   EUROPE AND NORTH AFRICA    The Europe
and North Africa segment consists of operations and exploration activities in Norway, the United Kingdom and Libya. In 2015, operations in Europe and North Africa contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of
natural gas production.     Norway  
   The Greater Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway in the North Sea, and comprises
three producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Embla. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Ekofisk South achieved first production in 2013, while Eldfisk II achieved startup in January 2015.
Continued development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk Area will contribute additional production over the coming years, as additional wells come online.  
 The Alvheim development is located in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and
subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) terminal at St. Fergus, Scotland, through the SAGE pipeline.  
 The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is stored in a floating storage unit and exported via shuttle tankers. Part of the
natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude oil production, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18 percent interest.  
 We also have varying ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norway sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, as well as the Aasta
Hansteen development. The operator is targeting first gas for Aasta Hansteen by late 2018.

    Exploration    
 ConocoPhillips participated in four nonoperated exploration and appraisal wells in the Oseberg, Visund and Aasta Hansteen areas. Two wells in the Oseberg area
were discoveries and were put on production; the others were discoveries currently undergoing evaluation. ConocoPhillips was awarded two new exploration licenses in early 2015, PL044C and PL782S with interests of 41.9 and 40.0 percent, respectively.
Two more licenses were awarded in early 2016, PL845 and PL782SB, both with interests of 40.0 percent.      Transportation    
 We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a crude oil stabilization and
natural gas liquids processing facility in Teesside, England. In November 2015, we sold our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled), which owns most of the Norwegian gas transportation infrastructure.
    United Kingdom       
   Britannia is one of the largest natural gas and condensate fields in the North Sea. We assumed operatorship of Britannia in
August 2015, following the acquisition of third party equity in Britannia Operator Limited, which is now wholly owned by ConocoPhillips. Condensate is delivered through the Forties Pipeline to an oil stabilization and processing plant near the
Grangemouth Refinery in Scotland, while natural gas is transported through Britannia s line to St. Fergus, Scotland. The Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, produce via subsea manifolds and pipelines linked to the Britannia
platform. Project startups for the Brodgar H3 susbsea tieback, and Enochdhu, a single well tie back to Callanish, were achieved in the first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. These projects increased Britannia s production in 2015 by
13.8 MBOED net. We are continuing work to hook up the Alder module to the Britannia facilities and anticipate delivery of first gas in 2016. Alder is a high-pressure, high-temperature gas condensate reservoir located in the U.K. Continental Shelf,
17 miles west of the Britannia facilities.    The J-Area consists of the Judy/Joanne, Jade and Jasmine fields, located in the U.K. Central North Sea. The
Jasmine Field is a high-pressure, high-temperature gas condensate reservoir located approximately six miles west of the Judy Platform. The development includes a 24-slot wellhead platform with a bridge-linked accommodation and utilities platform, a
six-mile, 16-inch multi-phase pipeline bundle, and a riser and processing platform bridge-linked to the existing Judy Platform.    We have various ownership
interests in several producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas of the Southern North Sea. Decommissioning activity in the Southern North Sea is ongoing, with final production from the Viking transportation system and
associated satellites achieved in early 2016. Our interests in the East Irish Sea include the Millom, Dalton and Calder fields, which are operated on our behalf by a third party.

  We own a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field, located in the Atlantic Margin. Clair Ridge is the second phase
of development for the Clair Field and is comprised of a 36-slot drilling and production facility with a bridge-linked accommodation and utilities platform. The new facilities will tie into existing oil and gas export pipelines to the Shetland
Islands. Initial production for Clair Ridge is targeted for 2018.      Exploration    
 During 2015, we participated in a nonoperated exploration/appraisal well in the Greater Clair area which was a discovery. The discovery is undergoing
evaluations for future development. We also drilled one operated exploration well north of the Jasmine Field in the Central Graben which was a dry hole, and were awarded two new licenses in the East Irish Sea.  
   Transportation      We operate the Teesside oil and
Theddlethorpe gas terminals in which we have 29.3 percent and 50 percent ownership interests, respectively. We also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party.  
  Greenland       Exploration    
 In 2015, we conducted field-based, metocean studies in Baffin Bay in Block 2011/11 of our operated Qamut license. Additionally, we participated in a 2-D
seismic acquisition program and geological and geophysical studies as part of the work program obligation in the nonoperated Avinngaq license. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated the process to assign our participating interest in the
Avinngaq license. The process is pending Greenland government approval.     Libya

    ASIA PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST  
 The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has exploration and production operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia; producing operations in Qatar
and Timor-Leste; and exploration activities in Brunei. In 2015, operations in the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 33 percent of natural gas production.  
  Australia and Timor Sea       
     Australia Pacific LNG    
 Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM
from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and converting the CBM into LNG. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers, while LNG is exported. Origin operates APLNG s upstream production and pipeline system, and we operate the
downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG export sales business.    Two fully subscribed
4.5 million tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been sanctioned. Approximately 3,900 net wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts. The wells will be supported by gathering systems, central
gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and a new export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG facilities. APLNG Train 1 achieved first LNG in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first cargo sailed in January
2016. Train 1 LNG is being sold to Sinopec under a 20-year sales agreement for up to 4.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year. Start-up of the second LNG train is expected to occur in the second half of 2016. The resulting LNG exports from
Train 2 will commence shortly thereafter. Sinopec has agreed to purchase an additional 3.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. has agreed to purchase approximately 1 million
metric tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years.    APLNG has an $8.5 billion project finance facility, of which $8.4 billion had been drawn from the facility at
December 31, 2015. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility until the project achieves financial completion. For additional information,
see Note 4 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 12 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   Bayu-Undan      The Bayu-Undan gas condensate field is
located in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin.  
 The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; and re-injects dry gas back into
the reservoir. In addition, a 310-mile natural gas pipeline connects the facility to the 3.5 million tonnes-per-year capacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is  
      14  

Table of Contents  

piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it is converted into LNG before being transported to international markets. In 2015, we sold 174 billion gross cubic feet of LNG primarily to utility
customers in Japan.    The Bayu-Undan Phase Three Development consists of two standalone, subsea horizontal wells tied back to the existing drilling,
production and processing platform. The first subsea, horizontal well commenced production in the first quarter of 2015. The well was tied back to the existing drilling, production, and processing platform. A second subsea, horizontal well was
drilled, completed, then suspended due to insufficient deliverability to the platform. There are no plans to remediate nor re-drill the well in the near  
 future. A continuation of Phase Three development is being evaluated, and is currently in the preliminary front-end engineering and design phase.  
 ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax
assessments. The arbitration hearing was conducted in June 2014. In January 2016, the Government of Timor-Leste and ConocoPhillips reached a settlement of several significant tax disputes. However, we await the Tribunal s decision with respect
to certain unresolved matters. For additional information, see Note 13 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   Athena/Perseus      The Athena production license
(WA-17-L) is located offshore Western Australia and contains part of the Perseus Field which straddles the boundary with WA-1-L, an adjoining license area. Natural gas is produced from these licenses.  
   Greater Sunrise      We have a 30 percent interest in
the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. In May 2013, the Timor-Leste Government referred a dispute with the Australian Government relating to the treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) to
international arbitration. The CMATS arbitration does not directly impact our underlying interests in Sunrise; however, we and the Sunrise co-venturers are unable to commit to further commercial and technical work activities due to the uncertainty
created by the lack of government alignment. Accordingly, current activities are restricted to compliance and social investment, as well as maintaining relationships and development options for Sunrise.  
   Exploration        

Conventional Exploration        We operate two exploration permits in the Browse
Basin, offshore northwest Australia, in which we own a 40 percent interest in permits WA-315-P and WA-398-P, of the Greater Poseidon Area. Phase I of the Browse Basin drilling campaign in 2009/2010 resulted in three discoveries in the Greater
Poseidon Area: Poseidon-1, Poseidon-2 and Kronos-1. Phase II of the drilling campaign resulted in five additional discoveries: Boreas-1, Zephyros-1, Proteus-1 SD2, Poseidon-North-1 and Pharos-1. All wells have been completed, plugged and abandoned.
   We operate two retention leases in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, where we own a 37.5 percent interest in leases
NT/RL5 and NT/RL6, containing the Barossa and Caldita discoveries. Three appraisal wells have been drilled to further evaluate the Barossa Field s potential. The first two wells encountered hydrocarbons and the third was not commercially
viable.      

Unconventional Exploration        In 2015, regulatory approval was received to withdraw
from the four exploration permits within the Canning Basin in Western Australia. Prior to withdrawal, we owned a 46 percent working interest in each of the four permits.

   Indonesia       
   We operate four production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia: the offshore South Natuna Sea Block B and three onshore
PSCs, the Corridor Block and South Jambi  B , both located in South Sumatra, and Kualakurun in Central Kalimantan. Currently there is production from two of these PSCs: the Corridor Block and South Natuna Sea Block B.  
   South Natuna Sea Block B      The offshore South
Natuna Sea Block B PSC has 3 producing oil fields and 16 natural gas fields in various stages of development. Natural gas production is sold under international sales agreements to Malaysia and Singapore, and liquefied petroleum gas is sold
locally for domestic consumption.      South Sumatra    
 The Corridor PSC consists of five oil fields and seven natural gas fields in various stages of development. Natural gas is supplied from the Grissik and Suban
gas processing plants to the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java. Production from the South Jambi  B  PSC has reached depletion and field development has been suspended.  
   Exploration      In 2015, we drilled and subsequently
recorded dry hole expense for one exploration well in the Palangkaraya PSC. This PSC was relinquished in the third quarter of 2015. We are also in the process of relinquishing our 80 percent interest in the Warim Block PSC. We have a 60 percent
working interest in the new Kualakurun PSC, located in Central Kalimantan, which was signed in May 2015. This block has an area of approximately 2 million gross acres.  
   Transportation      We are a 35 percent owner of
a consortium company that has a 40 percent ownership in PT Transportasi Gas Indonesia, which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri and Grissik to Singapore natural gas pipelines.  
  China       
   The Penglai 19-3, 19-9 and 25-6 fields are located in Bohai Bay Block 11/05. Production from the Phase 1 development of the
Penglai 19-3 Field began in 2002. Phase 2 included six additional wellhead platforms and an FPSO vessel, and was fully operational by 2009.  
      16  

Table of Contents  

  Currently, a project to add a new wellhead platform and up to 62 wells for the development of Penglai 19-9 is
progressing per schedule, with first oil expected in 2017.    We sanctioned the Penglai 19-3/19-9 Phase 3 Project in December 2015. This project will
consist of three new wellhead platforms and a central processing platform. First oil from Phase 3 is expected in 2018.    The Panyu development, located in
Block 15/34 in the South China Sea, is comprised of three oil fields: Panyu 4-2, Panyu 5-1 and Panyu 11-6. The PSC for the block is scheduled to expire in September 2018, at which time we will relinquish all working interest in the block.  
   Exploration      In 2015, we participated in two
successful appraisal wells in the Penglai fields, which will be used to support future development plans.     Malaysia   
   
   We own interests in four deepwater PSCs in Malaysia. Three are located off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah: Block G,
Block J and the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC). Our fourth PSC, deepwater Block 3E, is located off the Malaysian state of Sarawak.      Block G    
 We have a 21 percent interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai oil field, which began producing in the first quarter of 2014 and reached its estimated net
annual peak production of 5 MBOED in 2015. Development of the Malikai oil field is underway with first production anticipated in 2017. We own a 35 percent interest in the Malikai and Pisagan discoveries.  
   Block J      First production for Gumusut occurred
from an early production system in 2012. Production from a permanent, semi-submersible floating production vessel was achieved in October 2014, with estimated net annual peak production of 32 MBOED anticipated in 2016. Unitization of the Gumusut
Field with Brunei was recorded in 2014 and reduced our ownership interest from 33 percent to an initial 29 percent. A final ownership split is expected to be agreed in 2016.  
 We own a 40 percent interest in the Limbayong discovery. The Limbayong-2 appraisal well, located approximately seven miles from Gumusut, was drilled in 2013
and resulted in an oil discovery. Development options are being evaluated.      KBBC    
 We own a 30 percent interest in the KBBC PSC. Development of the KBB gas field commenced in 2011, and first production was achieved in November 2014. Gas
sales are currently constrained due to repairs on a third party pipeline. Estimated net annual peak production of 26 MBOED is expected in 2018. Kamunsu East is being evaluated for development options.

interest in the deepwater Block CA-2 PSC, which has an exploration period through December 2018. Exploration has been ongoing since September 2011, with natural gas discovered at the Kelidang NE-1 and Keratau-1 wells in 2013 and at the Keratau SW-1
well in 2015. Evaluation of the results is ongoing.     Myanmar   
   Exploration      In 2014, we were awarded deepwater
Block AD-10 in the 2013 Myanmar offshore oil and gas bidding round. We signed the PSC in the second quarter of 2015, and in the third quarter we initiated the process to assign our participating interest to the operator, pending Myanmar
government approval.     Qatar       
   QG3 is an integrated development jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent), ConocoPhillips
(30 percent) and Mitsui   Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). QG3 consists of upstream natural gas production facilities, which produce approximately 1.4 billion gross cubic feet per day of natural gas from Qatar s North Field
over a 25 year life, in addition to a 7.8 million gross tonnes-per-year LNG facility. LNG is shipped in leased LNG carriers destined for sale globally.  
 QG3 executed the development of the onshore and offshore assets as a single integrated development with Qatargas 4 (QG4), a joint venture between Qatar
Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell plc. This included the joint development of offshore facilities situated in a common offshore block in the North Field, as well as the construction of two identical LNG process trains and associated gas treating
facilities for both the QG3 and QG4 joint ventures. Production from the LNG trains and associated facilities is combined and shared.

the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our 50 percent interest in the Polar Lights Company, an entity which has developed several fields in the Timan-Pechora Basin in northern Russia.  
  Angola       Exploration    
 We have a 50 percent operating interest in Block 36 and a 30 percent operating interest in Block 37, both of which are located in Angola s subsalt play
trend. The two blocks total approximately 2.5 million gross acres and each block was awarded with a two-well work program commitment. We secured a rig for a four-well commitment program and commenced drilling in the second quarter of 2014. In
November 2014, we plugged and abandoned the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located in Block 36 offshore Angola, as a dry hole. We also subsequently plugged and abandoned the Omosi-1 and Vali-1 wells as dry holes in adjacent Block 37 in the first and
second quarters of 2015, respectively, and recorded an after-tax impairment of $75 million associated with our Angola Block 37 leasehold in the second quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded $335 million in after-tax charges for
the impairment, dry hole costs and future potential obligations associated with our Angola Block 36 leasehold. The Athena drilling rig, secured for our four-well commitment program, was mobilized to Senegal in October.  
  Senegal       Exploration    
 We have a 35 percent working interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal. In October 2014, we discovered a working petroleum system at the FAN-1
exploration well. In addition, in November 2014 we confirmed oil was discovered in the SNE-1 well, the second of the two-well program. We spud the SNE-2 and SNE-3 appraisal wells in the fourth quarter of 2015. We have the option to become operator
of the project if it advances to development.     Azerbaijan   
   Transportation      The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)
Pipeline transports crude oil from the Caspian Region through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey for tanker loadings at the port of Ceyhan. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we finalized the sale of our 2.5 percent interest in BTC.  
  Poland       Exploration    
 In the second quarter of 2015, we decided not to conduct further activity on our three Baltic Basin concessions, which encompassed approximately 500,000 gross
acres. As a result, we recorded an after-tax impairment of $32 million, net of other deductions.

   Colombia   
   Unconventional Exploration      We have an 80 percent
operated interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin block VMM-3. The block extends over 66,649 net acres and contains the Picoplata-1, which completed drilling in 2015. Continued evaluation and testing of the well is planned in 2016.  
 We hold 70 percent nonoperated interests in the deep rights in the Santa Isabel Block in the Middle Magdalena Basin, which covers approximately 71,000 net
acres. We also hold a 30 percent nonoperated interest in the VMM27 and VMM28 blocks, in the Middle Magdalena Basin, which are currently in the process of being relinquished.  
  Chile       Exploration    
 In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received approval from the Chilean government to become a 5 percent interest holder in the Coiron Block. Empresa Nacional del
Petroleo holds the remaining 95 percent interest and is the operator of the block.     Venezuela   
 In October 2014, we filed for arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the Venezuela
state oil company, for contractual compensation related to the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects. The ICC arbitration is a separate and independent legal action from the investment treaty arbitration against the government of Venezuela,
which is currently proceeding before an arbitral tribunal under the World Bank s International Centre for Settlement for Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal is determining the damages owed to ConocoPhillips as a result of
Venezuela s unlawful expropriation of ConocoPhillips  significant oil investments in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects and the offshore Corocoro development project in June 2007. For additional information, see Note
13 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Ecuador   
 In December 2012, an ICSID Tribunal issued a decision on liability in favor of Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,
finding that Ecuador s seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty. An additional arbitration phase to determine the damages owed to ConocoPhillips for Ecuador s
actions and to address Ecuador s counterclaims followed the decision on liability and we are now waiting for the Tribunal s award. For additional information, see Note 13 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.     Discontinued Operations     See

  OTHER  
  Marketing Activities     Our Commercial organization manages
our worldwide commodity portfolio, which mainly includes natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and LNG. Marketing activities are performed through offices in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. In marketing our production, we
attempt to minimize flow disruptions, maximize realized prices and manage credit-risk exposure. Commodity sales are generally made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. We also purchase and sell third-party volumes to better position the
company to satisfy customer demand while fully utilizing transportation and storage capacity.      Natural Gas    
 Our natural gas production, along with third-party purchased gas, is primarily marketed in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Our natural gas is sold
to a diverse client portfolio which includes local distribution companies; gas and power utilities; large industrials; independent, integrated or state-owned oil and gas companies; as well as marketing companies. To reduce our market exposure and
credit risk, we also transport natural gas via firm and interruptible transportation agreements to major market hubs.      Crude Oil, Bitumen and
Natural Gas Liquids      Our crude oil, bitumen and natural gas liquids revenues are derived from production in the United States, Canada, Australia,
Asia, Africa and Europe. These commodities are primarily sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation.  
   LNG      LNG marketing efforts are focused on equity
LNG production facilities located in Alaska, Australia, and Qatar. LNG is primarily sold under long-term contracts with prices based on market indices.  
  Energy Partnerships       Marine Well Containment
Company      We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010, which provides well
containment equipment and technology in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In January 2015, MWCC announced acceptance of its expanded containment system (ECS). The ECS complements the capabilities and capacities put into place with its interim
containment system, which the industry has been relying on since 2011. Equipment from both systems has been combined to form MWCC s containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a
subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.      Subsea Well Response Project
     In 2011, we, along with several leading oil and gas companies, launched the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP), a non-profit organization based
in Stavanger, Norway, which was created to enhance the industry s capability to respond to international subsea well control incidents. Through collaboration with Oil Spill Response Limited, a non-profit organization in the United Kingdom,
subsea well intervention equipment is available for the industry to use in the event of a subsea well incident. This complements the work being undertaken in the United States by MWCC.  
   Oil Spill Response Removal Organizations (OSROs)    
 We maintain memberships in several OSROs across the globe as a key element of our preparedness program in addition to internal response resources. Many of the
OSROs are not-for-profit cooperatives owned by the member companies wherein we may actively participate as a member of the board of directors, steering committee, work group or other supporting role. Globally, our primary OSRO is Oil Spill Response
Ltd. based in the U.K., with facilities in several other countries and the ability to respond anywhere in the world. In North America, our primary OSROs include the Marine Spill Response Corporation for the continental U.S. and Alaska Clean Seas and
Ship Escort/Response Vessel System for the Alaska North Slope and Prince  
      21

  William Sound, respectively. We are also a member of the Cook Inlet Spill Prevention and Response, Inc.
Internationally, we maintain memberships in various regional OSROs including the Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies, Australian Marine Oil Spill Center and Petroleum Industry of Malaysia Mutual Aid Group.  
  Technology     Our Technology organization has several
technology programs, which focus on areas to support our business growth plans: developing unconventional reservoirs, producing oil sands and heavy oil economically with fewer emissions, improving the economic efficiency of our LNG and other gas
solutions technologies, increasing recoveries from our legacy fields, and implementing sustainability measures.    Our Optimized Cascade    LNG liquefaction technology business continues to be successful with the demand for new LNG plants. The technology has been licensed for use in 25 LNG trains around the world, with feasibility
studies ongoing for additional trains.     RESERVES     We
have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2015. No difference exists between our estimated total proved reserves for year-end 2014 and year-end
2013, which are shown in this filing, and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2015.     DELIVERY COMMITMENTS
    We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a
fixed and determinable quantity. Our Commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market.
Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, including approximately 430 billion cubic feet related to the noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and 230 million
barrels of crude oil in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2028. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we anticipate using proved
undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases to fulfill any remaining commitments. See the disclosure on  Proved Undeveloped Reserves  in the  Oil and Gas Operations  section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, for information on the development of proved undeveloped reserves.       COMPETITION   
 We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the E P business. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater
resources. Each of our segments is highly competitive, with no single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominating.    We compete with numerous
other companies in the industry, including state-owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on statistics published in
the September 7, 2015, issue of the  Oil and Gas Journal , we were the third-largest U.S.-based oil and gas company in worldwide liquids and natural gas production and reserves in 2014. We deliver our production into the worldwide
commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and safely operating oil and gas
producing properties.

     Item 1A. RISK FACTORS   
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk
factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.  
   Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices.
     Prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG can fluctuate widely. Globally, prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural
gas, natural gas liquids and LNG have recently experienced significant declines from their historic levels during 2013 and 2014, with continued global production increases that have outpaced demand growth, leading to a large observed rise in global
inventory. Prices for Brent crude oil, WTI crude oil, Henry Hub natural gas and natural gas liquids in the fourth quarter of 2015 have all declined more than 40 percent when compared with prices in the fourth quarter of 2014, and there are no
indications the price declines will reverse themselves in the immediate future.    Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly
dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG prices may have
a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, cash flows and liquidity and on the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock. Lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically,
adversely affecting our ability to maintain our reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields.  
 Significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures or
impair the carrying value of our assets. During 2015, we recognized several impairments, which are described in Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If commodity prices remain low relative to their historic
levels, and as we continue to optimize our investments and exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairments to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under
the equity method and unproved properties. Although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments at this time, our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.  
   Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to certain considerations.    
 Dividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:  

Cash available for distribution.    

Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations.    

Our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties.    

The level of reserves we establish for future capital expenditures.    

The level of distributions paid by comparable companies.    

Our operating expenses.    

Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.      We expect to continue to pay quarterly distributions to
our stockholders; however, we bear all expenses incurred by our operations, and our funds generated by operations, after deducting these expenses, may not be sufficient to cover desired levels of distributions to our stockholders. Any downward
revision in our distribution could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  
      24  

Table of Contents  

    We may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms.    
 We have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fund our operations and strategy, however we have also relied from time to time
on access to the debt and equity capital markets for funding. There can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be
subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our then-outstanding debt. If we are unable to generate
sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital, our growth could be impeded.    In addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major rating
agencies based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally. Due to the significant recent decline in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG,
and the expectation that these prices could remain depressed in the near future, the major ratings agencies have indicated they will be conducting a review of the oil and gas industry and the debt ratings for some companies operating in the industry
may be downgraded. The results of these actions, including any downgrade in our credit rating, could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur.  
   Our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third parties with whom we do
business.      The operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries,
including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy. Market
speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties, or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations, may also exacerbate any operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing, particularly as it
relates to other companies in the oil and gas industry as a result of the recent significant declines in commodity prices. Any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform obligations under agreements we have made
with third parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. In addition, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or
may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances.      Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen,
natural gas and natural gas liquids production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.      The rate of production from upstream
fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery
reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Accordingly, to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids we
produce with good prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations. Any cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a result of commodity price declines may further limit our ability to
replace depleted reserves.      Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and
natural gas liquids reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.     Our proved reserve information included in this annual report
has been derived from engineering estimates prepared by our personnel. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids that
cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same
available data. Any significant future price changes could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions  
      25  

Table of Contents  

underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated with
the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. In addition to changes in the quantity and value of our proved reserves, the amount of crude oil, bitumen,
natural gas and natural gas liquids that can be obtained from any proved reserve may ultimately be different from those estimated prior to extraction.  
   We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental
laws and regulations. Likewise, future environmental laws and regulations, such as limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.    
 Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in
both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:      

The discharge of pollutants into the environment.    

Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions.    

Carbon taxes.    

The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.    

The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.    

Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and tight oil plays.    
 We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and
regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially
adversely affected.    Although our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are
significant changes in the Earth s climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and
demand for our products could fall. Demand for our products may also be adversely affected by conservation plans and efforts undertaken in response to global climate change, including plans developed in connection with the recent Paris climate
conference in December 2015. Many governments also provide, or may in the future provide, tax advantages and other subsidies to support the use and development of alternative energy technologies. Our operations and the demand for our products could
be materially impacted by the development and adoption of these technologies.      Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could
damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.      Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreign governments, through
tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on our operations; special
taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries. U.S. federal, state and local legislative and
regulatory agencies  initiatives regarding the hydraulic fracturing process could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of our oil and gas wells.  
      26  

Table of Contents  

  The U.S. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions
and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of
our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and may continue to do so in the future. Changes in domestic and international regulations may affect our ability to obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and development of
wells or for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities in various locations.    Local political and economic factors in international
markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 54 percent of our hydrocarbon production from continuing operations was derived from production outside the United States in 2015, and 61 percent of our proved reserves, as of
December 31, 2015, was located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, natural gas
liquids or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations. In particular, some countries where we operate lack well-developed legal systems or
have not adopted clear legal and regulatory frameworks for oil and gas exploration and production. This lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those
jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as expropriations.      Changes in governmental regulations
may impose price controls and limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids.      Our operations are subject to
extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids wells below actual
production capacity. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.  
   Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.    
 We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture partners. There is a risk our joint venture
participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be
required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.      We do not insure against all
potential losses; therefore, we could be harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.      We maintain insurance against many, but not all,
potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks. As such, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks
could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
   Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.    
 The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires,
crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civil unrest or cyber attacks. Our operations may also be adversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving services or
infrastructure required to develop, produce, process or transport our production, such as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines, railcars, tankers, barges or other infrastructure. Our operations are subject to the additional hazards of pollution,
releases of toxic gas and  
      27  

Table of Contents  

other environmental hazards and risks. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths
and metocean conditions. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation. Further, our business
and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational
components and capacity.    Our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cybersecurity breaches. Although we have experienced occasional, actual
or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely
affected by having our business systems compromised, our proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our business operations disrupted. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to
continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities.

Item 3.  
  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those
involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters that arose during the fourth quarter of
2015, as well as matters previously reported in our 2014 Form 10-K and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2015 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to the fourth quarter of 2015. Material developments to the previously reported matters have
been included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings were to be decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be
no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to SEC regulations.    On April 30,
2012, the separation of our downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. In connection with the separation, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement, which provides for
cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and established procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters, such as legal proceedings. We have included matters where we remain a party to a proceeding relating to
Phillips 66, in accordance with SEC regulations. We do not expect any of those matters to result in a net claim against us.      Matters Previously
Reported Phillips 66      In October 2007, ConocoPhillips received a Complaint from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) alleging
violations of the Clean Water Act related to a 2006 oil spill at the Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery and proposing a penalty of $156,000.    On May 19,
2010, the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) alleging various violations of applicable air emission regulations, as
well as certain provisions of the consent decree in Civil Action No. H-01-4430. In July 2014, Phillips 66 resolved the consent decree issues and in January 2016, an agreement was reached with LDEQ to resolve the remaining allegations.

  On October 15, 2012, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (Bay Area AQMD) issued a $313,000 demand
to settle 13 other Notice of Violation (NOV) issued in 2010 and 2011 with respect to alleged violations of regulatory and/or permit requirements at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery.  
 In May 2012, the Illinois Attorney General s office filed and notified ConocoPhillips of a complaint with respect to operations at the Phillips 66 WRB
Wood River Refinery alleging violations of the Illinois groundwater standards and a third-party s hazardous waste permit. The complaint seeks as relief remediation of area groundwater; compliance with the hazardous waste permit; enhanced
pipeline and tank integrity measures; additional spill reporting; and yet-to-be specified amounts for fines and penalties.    On July 7, 2014, Phillips
66 received an NOV from the U.S. EPA alleging various flaring-related violations between 2009 and 2013 at the Phillips 66 Wood River Refinery. ConocoPhillips is not a named party in the NOV and we will therefore no longer report this matter.  
 On July 8, 2014, the Bay Area AQMD issued a $175,000 demand to settle 18 NOVs issued in 2010 with respect to alleged violations of regulatory and/or
permit requirements at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery.    On July 8, 2014, the Bay Area AQMD issued a $259,000 demand to settle 20 NOVs issued in 2011
with respect to alleged violations of regulatory and/or permit requirements at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery.

 3  Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.      BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW   
 ConocoPhillips is the world s largest independent exploration and production (E P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and
natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 21 countries. At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 15,900 people worldwide and had total assets of $97.5 billion. Our stock is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol  COP.      Basis of Presentation   
 Effective November 1, 2015, the Other International and historically presented Europe segments were restructured to align with changes to our internal
organization structure. The Libya business was moved from the Other International segment to the historically presented Europe segment, which is now renamed Europe and North Africa. Accordingly, results of operations for the Other International and
Europe and North Africa segments have been revised in all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the impact on our segment presentation is immaterial. For additional information, see
Note 24 Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Overview   
 We are an independent E P company focused on exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our diverse portfolio primarily
includes resource-rich North American unconventional assets and oil sands assets in Canada; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and an inventory of global conventional and
unconventional exploration prospects.    The energy landscape changed dramatically in the past year. Increased supply caused commodity prices to decline
substantially. In December 2015, we announced a 2016 operating plan based on $7.7 billion of capital expenditures. This represented a reduction of 24 percent, compared to 2015 actual expenditures, sourced from the completion of several major
projects, as well as deferrals, deflation capture and efficiencies across the portfolio.  
      34  

Table of Contents  

  In response to an outlook of lower prices in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as credit tightening across the
industry, we revised our 2016 operating plan in February 2016, reducing our capital expenditures guidance by 17 percent, from $7.7 billion to $6.4 billion. We also reduced our quarterly dividend by 66 percent, to $0.25 per share. These actions,
taken to maintain a strong balance sheet, will enable us to continue to deliver an investment offering of a competitive dividend, disciplined growth and financial strength. We also believe these actions position the company for success in a lower,
more volatile price environment, with the flexibility to adjust to commodity price movements in the future.     Key Operating and Financial Summary
    Significant items during 2015 included the following:      

Achieved full-year production of 1,589 MBOED; 5 percent production growth from continuing operations, adjusted for Libya, downtime and dispositions.    

Lowered operating costs year over year.    

Achieved major project startups at APLNG and Surmont 2.    

Completed additional startups at Eldfisk II, CD5, Drill Site 2S, Enochdhu and the Brodgar H3 subsea tie-back.    

Announced phased exit from deepwater exploration.    

Completed approximately $2 billion of non-core asset dispositions across the portfolio.    

Ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.      We accomplished several strategic milestones
in 2015. Excluding Libya, our production from continuing operations was 1,589 MBOED, compared with 1,532 MBOED in 2014, a 57 MBOED increase. The production increase was driven by growth from major projects and development programs, as well as
improved well performance, partially offset by normal field decline. In 2015, we generated $2 billion from the disposition of certain non-core assets in our portfolio. The full-year 2015 production impact of completed dispositions was 64 MBOED.  
 In 2015, we reviewed our cost structure and took decisive actions to achieve sustainable operating cost reductions across the company. We targeted a $1
billion reduction in operating costs in 2016, compared with 2014. We reduced headcount, including management positions, to streamline decision-making, increased the autonomy in our business units, captured deflation and adjusted our activity levels,
which resulted in achieving our stated target in 2015, a year ahead of schedule. Operating costs include production and operating expense; selling, general and administrative expense; and exploration expense excluding dry hole and leasehold
impairment expense.    We generated $7.6 billion in cash from continuing operations in 2015, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.7 billion and ended
the year with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents.     Business Environment   
 In the first half of 2014, strong crude oil prices were supported by geopolitical tensions impacting supplies, as well as global oil demand growth. This was
followed by an abrupt decline in prices during the fourth quarter of 2014, as surging production growth from U.S. tight oil and the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain production outweighed fears of
supply disruptions. These developments, combined with slowing global oil demand growth, caused crude oil prices to plummet to near five-year lows at the end of 2014. Prices remained significantly lower throughout 2015, reaching a ten-year quarterly
low of $43.67 for Brent crude oil, in the fourth quarter of 2015. Lower 2015 prices contributed to higher demand growth which was overwhelmed by continued production increase and supply surplus. Brent crude oil was $30.69 in January 2016, reflecting
an ongoing decline in prices.

  The energy industry has periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating
supply-and-demand conditions. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Among other dynamics that could influence world energy markets and
commodity prices are global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. North
America s energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply, primarily due to advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of tight oil production, successful exploration and rising production
from the Canadian oil sands. Our strategy is to sustainably lower our cost structure and maintain a strong balance sheet and a diverse low cost-of-supply portfolio that can provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycles.
     Operating and Financial Priorities      Other
important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include:      

Maintaining a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship.  Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed
to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage
risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2015 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and
responsive to common questions. We are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and operational performance.    
 We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010 to improve industry spill
response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed a containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, which enhances the oil industry s ability to respond to subsea well-control
incidents in international waters.      

Exercising our capital flexibility.  We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational
and generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.
Given our view of greater price volatility, we see benefit in having an inventory of value-preserving, shorter cycle time and low cost-of-supply opportunities in our resource base. In response to weakening commodity prices, we have slowed the pace
of certain discretionary investments, including the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, as well as emerging unconventional plays in the Permian, Niobrara and Montney, and plan to fund additional cash calls in our equity affiliates. We retain the flexibility
to increase or decrease investment activity without loss of opportunity, and will reassess our near-term investment decisions as necessary. We use a disciplined approach, focused on value maximization, to set our capital plans.    
 In February 2016, we announced a revised capital budget of $6.4 billion for 2016, a reduction of 37 percent compared with actual capital
expenditures of $10.1 billion in 2015. The $3.7 billion reduction primarily reflects lower spending on major projects, deferral of activity primarily in the Lower 48, deflation capture and efficiencies across the portfolio.  
      36  

Table of Contents  

Portfolio optimization.  We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost-of-supply assets which strategically fit our development plans. In the third quarter of 2015, we announced plans to
reduce future capital spending in our deepwater exploration program. As a result, we terminated our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco and impaired certain Gulf of Mexico leases where we decided not to conduct further activity.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded dry hole expense and impaired additional leases in the Canada segment due to streamlined capital plans.    
 In 2015, we generated approximately $2 billion in proceeds from non-core asset dispositions, including the sales of certain western Canadian
properties, producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana, producing properties in South Texas, a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas, and our 50 percent equity method investment in the Russian joint venture, Polar Lights
Company. We will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing our capital investments to areas that align with our objectives.  

Controlling costs and expenses.  Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are
reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment.

Adding to our proved reserve base.  We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:        

Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields.    

Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.    

Acquisition of existing fields.      Proved reserve estimates require economic production based on
historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs. Therefore, our proved reserves generally decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise. Additionally, as we undertake cash conservation efforts, our reserve replacement
efforts could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserves. Low commodity prices and reduced capital expenditures in 2015 adversely affected our reported year-end proved reserves. In 2015, our organic reserve replacement
excluding the impact of sales and purchases was 10 percent. In the five years ended December 31, 2015, our organic reserve replacement was 117 percent, excluding the impact of sales and purchases.  
 Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In
addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively
impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.  

Applying technical capability . We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to
optimally apply best practices. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across all of our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to
reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact.        

Developing and retaining a talented work force.  We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to
implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. To this end, we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the     
      37  

Table of Contents  

best talent and, as needed, recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured
development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees.       Other significant factors that can
affect our profitability include:      

Commodity prices.  Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas, the prices of which are subject to factors external to the company and over
which we have no control. The following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas:    

Crude oil prices have remained under pressure throughout 2015 due to continued global production increase
that has outpaced demand growth, leading to a large observed rise in global inventory. Brent crude oil prices averaged $43.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 43 percent compared with $76.27 per barrel in the fourth
quarter of 2014. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices declined 43 percent from $73.41 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $42.10 per barrel in the same period of 2015.  
 Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $2.27 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 44 percent
compared with $4.04 per MMBTU in the fourth quarter of 2014. Natural gas prices remained under pressure as production growth continued and U.S. underground gas storage inventories rose to the top of the five-year range in late 2015.  
 Natural gas liquids prices were also lower in 2015. Our realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $16.42 per barrel in the fourth quarter
of 2015, a decrease of 47 percent compared with $31.07 per barrel in the same quarter of 2014. The expansion in tight oil production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in continued downward pressure on natural gas
liquids prices in the United States.    Declining global crude oil prices have resulted in the Western Canada Select benchmark price
experiencing a 52 percent decline, from $73.60 per barrel in 2014 to $35.21 per barrel in 2015. Consequently, our realized bitumen price experienced a decrease relative to 2014 price levels. Our realized bitumen price was $18.72 per barrel in 2015,
a decrease of 66 percent compared with $55.13 in the same period of 2014.  
      38  

Table of Contents  

  Our total average realized price from continuing operations was $34.34 per barrel of oil
equivalent (BOE) in 2015, a decrease of 47 percent compared with $64.59 per BOE in 2014. Our total average realized price was $28.54 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 46 percent compared with $52.88 per BOE in the fourth quarter
of 2014. The reduction in the prices reflects lower average realized prices across all commodities.    In recent years, the use of hydraulic
fracturing and horizontal drilling in tight oil formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for
our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of tight oil plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of
plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields or Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional asset
impairments might be possible.    Going forward, domestic crude prices should reach a market equilibrium with global crude prices due to the
recent overturn of the U.S. crude export bans.      

Impairments.  As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline
significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling
proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. In 2015, we recorded pre-tax impairments of $2.2 billion for proved properties and an equity method investment and $1.9 billion for unproved properties, compared with $856
million and $562 million in 2014. For additional information on our impairments in 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    

Effective tax rate.  Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective
tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the  mix  of pretax earnings within our global operations.           

Fiscal and regulatory environment.  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil
unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative
impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports have been suspended or significantly curtailed since July 2013 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011
during Libya s period of civil unrest. In 2015, the United Kingdom government enacted tax legislation which reduced our U.K. corporate tax rate by 12 percent, while the Alberta provincial government enacted legislation increasing our overall
Canadian corporate tax rate by 2 percent. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in
such countries.

   Outlook   
 Consistent with our revised 2016 operating plan announced in February 2016, our full-year 2016 production from continuing operations is expected to be flat
with 2015 production of 1,525 MBOED, which excludes 64 MBOED for the full-year impact of completed dispositions. First-quarter 2016 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1,540 MBOED to 1,580 MBOED.  
   Marketing Activities      In line with our objective
to continuously optimize our portfolio, we are currently marketing certain non-core assets. We expect to generate up to $1 billion in proceeds annually from asset sales.  
   Impairments      As a result of lower commodity
prices, and as we optimize our investments and exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely we may incur future impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the
equity method, and unproved properties. Although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of future impairment charges at this time, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected for the period in which impairment
charges are incurred.     Operating Segments     We manage
our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.  
 Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, certain technology
activities, as well as licensing revenues received.    Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the
operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
  Consolidated Results     A
summary of the company s income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows:      
    2015 vs. 2014     Earnings
for ConocoPhillips decreased 175 percent in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to lower commodity prices.    In addition, earnings were negatively impacted
by:      

Higher proved property and equity investment impairments, including a $1.5 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG.    

Higher exploration expenses. Exploration expenses increased mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, dry hole costs and other exploration expenses. The increase included after-tax unproved property
impairments of $368 million for our Alaska Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest, $310 million for our Angola Block 36 and 37 Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), $154 million for multiple Gulf of Mexico leases, and $100 million for
various Gila Prospect blocks. Additional after-tax dry hole costs and other expenses resulted from a $185 million charge for several properties in Canada, $137 million for two dry holes in Angola, $111 million for a dry hole in the Gila Prospect in
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and $246 million related to the termination of our drilling contract with Ensco.    

Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A), mainly from increased production and commodity price-driven reserve revisions.    

Higher restructuring charges and pension settlement expense.      These reductions to earnings were partly offset
by higher sales volumes, lower production taxes due to reduced commodity prices, lower operating expenses, a $555 million net deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in the U.K. tax rate in the first quarter of 2015, the absence of a $540
million after-tax loss resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement, gain on sale of assets, and higher licensing revenue.     2014 vs. 2013
    Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 28 percent in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to:  

Lower crude oil prices.    

Higher operating expenses, which included the 2014 recognition of a $540 million after-tax loss resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement.    
      41  

Table of Contents  

Higher DD A expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and the United Kingdom, partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada related to reserve bookings.    

Higher exploration expenses.      These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher volumes; lower
production taxes, which mainly resulted from higher capital spending, lower prices and lower production volumes in Alaska; and higher natural gas and LNG prices.  
  Income Statement Analysis      2015 vs. 2014   
  Sales and other operating revenues  decreased 44 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of lower prices across all commodities. Lower prices were partly
offset by higher crude oil and LNG sales volumes.     Equity in earnings of affiliates  decreased 74 percent in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to
lower earnings from FCCL Partnership and Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), given lower commodity prices, partly offset by higher volumes and lower operational costs.  
  Gain on dispositions  increased by $493 million in 2015. The increase resulted from a $583 million gain from the sales of producing properties in East
Texas and North Louisiana, South Texas, and a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas. Gains realized were partly offset by a net loss from the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada. For additional information on gains on
dispositions, see Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.     Other income  decreased 66 percent
in 2015, mainly due to the absence of 2014 income related to the resolution of a contingent liability in the Other International segment and a legal arbitration settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East, respectively.  
  Purchased commodities  decreased 44 percent in 2015, largely as a result of lower natural gas prices and the absence of a $130 million loss in the Lower
48 related to transportation and storage capacity agreements recognized in 2014.     Production and operating expenses  decreased 21 percent in 2015,
largely due to lower operating expense activity, including reduced turnarounds at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility, favorable foreign exchange-related impacts, and the absence of an $849 million charge resulting from the Freeport LNG
termination agreement in 2014. The decrease in expense was partially offset by restructuring expenses of $206 million in 2015.     Selling, general
and administrative (SG A) expenses  increased 30 percent in 2015, primarily due to $407 million in restructuring and pension settlement expenses in 2015, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs.  
  Exploration expenses  increased 105 percent in 2015, mainly as a result of higher unproved property impairments, primarily in Alaska, Angola and the
Lower 48. Higher dry hole and other exploration costs, including a $253 million pre-tax expense for wells charged to dry hole in Canada, a $383 million expense related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, and a $176
million charge for two wells charged to dry hole in the Gila prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, also contributed to the increase in exploration expenses. For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see
Note 8 Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, and Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents  

   DD A  increased 9 percent in 2015. The increase was mainly associated with higher production volumes in
the Lower 48 and Asia Pacific and Middle East and commodity price-related reserve revisions. The increase was partly offset by reserve additions in the Lower 48.  
  Impairments  increased 162 percent in 2015. For additional information, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Taxes other than income taxes  decreased 57 percent in 2015, mainly due to lower production taxes from reduced commodity prices in the Lower 48,
Alaska and Asia Pacific and Middle East.     Interest and debt expense  increased 42 percent in 2015, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on
projects and increased average debt levels in 2015.    See Note 19 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information
regarding our  provision for income taxes  and effective tax rate.     2014 vs. 2013   
  Sales and other operating revenues  decreased 3 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher crude oil and
bitumen volumes and higher natural gas prices.     Equity in earnings of affiliates  increased 14 percent in 2014, primarily as a result of higher
earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher bitumen volumes and prices. This increase was partially offset by lower earnings from APLNG, mostly as a result of higher operating expenses and DD A.  
  Gain on dispositions  decreased $1,144 million in 2014. Gains realized in 2014 mostly resulted from the disposition of certain properties in western
Canada. For additional information on gains realized in prior years, see Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Production and operating expenses  increased 23 percent in 2014, largely due to the $849 million charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination
agreement. Higher drilling and maintenance activity, mostly in the Lower 48, Australia, Alaska and Europe, in addition to the absence of the 2013 benefit of a $142 million accrual reduction related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
approval of cost allocation (pooling) agreements with the remaining owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), also contributed to the increase. These increases were partly offset by the absence of a $155 million charge in 2013 related
to Bohai Bay. For additional information on the Freeport LNG transaction, see Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  SG A expenses  decreased 14 percent in 2014, mainly due to the absence of pension settlement expenses.  
  Exploration expenses  increased 66 percent in 2014, mainly as a result of higher impairments of undeveloped leasehold costs, primarily in the Lower 48
and Canada, and higher dry hole costs, mostly associated with the Gulf of Mexico and Angola. For additional information on the leasehold impairments, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  DD A  increased 12 percent in 2014. This increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the United Kingdom and the Lower 48,
partly offset by lower unit-of-production rates in Canada associated with year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions and lower natural gas production volumes.  
  Impairments  increased 62 percent in 2014. For additional information, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Taxes other than income taxes  decreased 28 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower production taxes, which
resulted from higher capital spending, lower crude oil prices and lower production volumes in Alaska.     Interest and debt expense  increased 6
percent in 2014, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects, partly offset by lower interest expense from lower average debt levels and a $28 million benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement.

***Thousands  
  of barrels of oil equivalent per day.       We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil,
bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2015, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia
and Qatar.    Total production from continuing operations, including Libya, increased 3 percent in 2015. The increase in total average production in 2015
primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Gumusut in Malaysia; APLNG in Australia; Greater Britannia projects and the J-Area in the U.K.; and the ramp-up of Foster Creek Phase F
in Canada. Improved well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway, and lower turnaround activity also contributed to higher production in 2015. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline. Adjusted for downtime
and dispositions of 13 MBOED, our production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, increased by 70 MBOED, or 5 percent, compared with 2014. Full-year 2015 production from assets sold or under agreement was 64 MBOED.  
 In 2014, average production from continuing operations increased 3 percent compared with 2013, while average liquids production increased 4 percent. The
increase in total average production in 2014 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, mainly from tight oil plays in the Lower 48 and the ramp up of production from Jasmine in the United Kingdom and Christina Lake in
Canada, and increased drilling programs, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline, higher planned downtime, shut-in Libya production due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil
export terminal, and unfavorable market impacts. Adjusted for Libya, production from continuing operations increased by 60 MBOED, or 4 percent, compared with 2013.

   Alaska       
   The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and
LNG. In 2015, Alaska contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production.     2015 vs. 2014
    Alaska reported earnings of $4 million in 2015, compared with earnings of $2,041 million in 2014, mainly due to lower commodity prices and a $368
million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 for the impairment of our Chukchi Sea leasehold and capitalized interest. The earnings decrease was partly offset by reduced production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices.  
 Average production decreased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to normal field decline, partly offset by lower planned downtime activity and
new production from the Western North Slope, Greater Prudhoe and Greater Kuparuk areas.     2014 vs. 2013   
 Alaska earnings decreased 10 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 earnings. The decrease was largely due to lower crude oil prices and volumes; the absence of a
$97 million after-tax benefit associated with a FERC ruling in 2013, more fully described below; higher operating expenses; and a $36 million after-tax impairment related to a cancelled project. These reductions to earnings were partly offset by
lower production taxes, which resulted from higher 2014 capital spending and lower crude oil prices and volumes. Higher LNG sales volumes and prices also partially offset the decrease in 2014 earnings.  
 In 2012, the major owners of TAPS filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve pooling disputes prior to August 2012 and establish a voluntary pooling
agreement to pool costs prospectively from August 2012. In July 2013, FERC approved the proposed settlement and pooling agreement without modification. As a result, we reduced a related accrual in the second quarter of 2013, which decreased our
production and operating expenses by $97 million after-tax.    Average production decreased 9 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, mainly as a result of
normal field decline and higher planned maintenance, partly offset by lower unplanned downtime.

   Lower 48       
   The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of
Mexico. During 2015, the Lower 48 contributed 33 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of our natural gas production.     2015
vs. 2014     Lower 48 reported a loss of $1,932 million after-tax in 2015, compared with a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014. The decrease in
earnings was primarily due to:      

Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices.    

Higher DD A, mostly due to increased crude oil production.    

Higher exploration expenses    

Increased impairment expense in 2015, including after-tax charges of $154 million for certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico and $100 million for various blocks in the Gila Prospect, where we ceased further activity.

A $246 million charge to exploration expense related to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco.    

Higher dry hole costs, including $111 million associated with two wells in the Gila Prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.    
 These decreases were partly offset by the absence of a $545 million after-tax charge resulting from the Freeport LNG termination agreement in 2014; a $368
million after-tax gain from the disposition of certain properties in South Texas, East Texas and Northern Louisiana; higher volumes; lower production taxes; and the absence of a $151 million after-tax impairment charge resulting from reduced volume
forecasts on proved properties and the associated undeveloped leasehold costs.    Our average realized prices in the Lower 48 have historically correlated
with WTI prices; however, beginning in the second half of 2013, our Lower 48 crude differential versus WTI began to widen. Our 2015 average realized crude oil price of $42.62 per barrel was 13 percent less than WTI of $48.72 per barrel. The
differential is driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast, Bakken and the Permian Basin, and may remain relatively wide in the near-term.  
 Total average production increased 2 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while average crude oil production increased 10 percent across the same period. The
increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian Basin, partially offset by normal field decline.

   2014 vs. 2013   
 The Lower 48 reported a loss of $22 million after-tax in 2014, compared with earnings of $754 million after-tax in 2013. The decrease in earnings was
primarily attributable to:      

Higher operating expenses, which included the $545 million after-tax charge to earnings due to the Freeport LNG termination agreement.    

Lower crude oil prices.    

Higher DD A, mostly due to higher crude oil production.    

Higher impairments. Earnings in 2014 were impacted by impairments of approximately $290 million after-tax. Property impairments were not material in 2013. For additional information, see Note 9 Impairments, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    

Higher dry hole costs. Dry hole costs in 2014 were approximately $180 million after-tax, primarily for the nonoperated Coronado wildcat and appraisal wells, the Shenandoah appraisal well and the Deep Nansen wildcat
well, all located in the Gulf of Mexico. Dry hole costs in 2013 were approximately $130 million after-tax and mainly consisted of the Ardennes and Thorn wells, also located in the Gulf of Mexico.    

An $83 million after-tax loss recognized upon the release of underutilized transportation and storage capacity at rates below our contractual rates.    
 These reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes, higher natural gas prices and a benefit to earnings of
approximately $150 million after-tax from marketing third-party natural gas volumes.    Total average production in the Lower 48 increased 9 percent in
2014, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent. The increase was mainly attributable to new production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and improved drilling and well performance, partially offset by normal field decline.

   Canada       
   Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca
Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2015, Canada contributed 21 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our worldwide natural gas production.  
  2015 vs. 2014     Canada operations reported a loss of
$1,044 million in 2015, a reduction of $1,984 million compared with 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to:      

Lower bitumen and natural gas prices.    

Higher exploration expenses    

Higher dry hole costs, including an after-tax charge of $185 million associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties.    

An after-tax impairment charge of $75 million for undeveloped leasehold in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas.    

A 2 percent increase in Alberta corporate tax rates on deferred taxes.    

A $103 million net after-tax loss realized on the disposition of non-core assets in western Canada.      The
earnings decrease was partly offset by higher bitumen production volumes; lower operating expenses and DD A, both primarily from favorable foreign currency impacts; and the absence of the $109 million after-tax impairment of undeveloped
leasehold costs associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties in 2014.    Total average production
increased 8 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, while bitumen production increased 17 percent over the same periods. The increases in total production were mainly attributable to strong well performance in western Canada, lower royalty impacts,
strong plant performance at Foster Creek  
      49  

Table of Contents  

and Christina Lake and the continued ramp-up of production from Foster Creek Phase F. These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and increased unplanned downtime, including the
precautionary shut down of Foster Creek for nearby forest fires in the second quarter of 2015.     2014 vs. 2013   
 Canada earnings increased 31 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of higher natural gas and bitumen prices, lower DD A from western
Canada and higher bitumen volumes. The lower DD A mainly resulted from lower unit-of-production rates related to year-end 2013 price-related reserve revisions and lower natural gas production volumes. Earnings in 2014 also included a $47 million
tax benefit resulting from a favorable tax settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, mainly as a result of the $461 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold in
2013, as well as the 2013 recognition of a $224 million tax benefit, related to the favorable tax resolution associated with the sale of certain western Canada properties. Lower natural gas volumes also partially offset the increase in 2014
earnings.    In addition, earnings in 2014 benefitted from lower impairments. Impairments in 2014 were $138 million after-tax and consisted primarily of the
$109 million after-tax impairment of unproved properties associated with the offshore Amauligak discovery, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas
assets in western Canada.    For additional information on asset sales, see Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, and for additional information on
impairments, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Total average production increased 3 percent in 2014
compared with 2013, while bitumen production increased 18 percent over the same period. The continued ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phase E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance were partly offset by normal field decline and
higher royalty impacts.     Europe and North Africa       
   The Europe and North Africa segment consists of producing and exploration operations principally located in the Norwegian and
U.K. sectors of the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, as well as in Libya. In 2015, our Europe and North Africa operations contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of our natural gas production.  
      50  

Table of Contents  

   2015 vs. 2014   
 Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations decreased 50 percent in 2015. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas
prices. Earnings further decreased due to higher property impairments in the U.K., given lower natural gas prices and increases to asset retirement obligations. The earnings decrease was partly offset by a $555 million net deferred tax benefit as a
result of a change in the U.K. tax rate, effective at the beginning of 2015, and an after-tax gain of $49 million realized on the sale of our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled).  
 For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Average production decreased 5 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease in production was mostly due to normal field decline and lower volumes from
Libya, partly offset by the new production from the Greater Britannia Area, the J-Area and the Greater Ekofisk Area, as well as improved well performance in Norway.  
 The Es Sider Terminal in Libya remained shut in throughout 2015. The 2016 operating and drilling activity in Libya is uncertain as a result of the ongoing
civil unrest.     2014 vs. 2013     Earnings for Europe
and North Africa decreased 37 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was primarily due to higher DD A, which mainly resulted from increased production volumes from Jasmine, lower crude oil and natural gas prices, higher
taxes, higher impairments, and lower volumes from Libya. Impairments in 2014 were $192 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2013 of $118 million after-tax. Lower gains from asset dispositions, mostly due to the absence of the $83 million
after-tax gain on the disposition of our interest in the Interconnector Pipeline in 2013, also contributed to the decrease in 2014 earnings. These decreases were partly offset by higher volumes, primarily in the U.K., and a $48 million after-tax
benefit from a pension-related settlement.    For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.    Average production was flat in 2014 compared with 2013, as the continued ramp-up of production from Jasmine, the Rivers Acid Plant
in the East Irish Sea and Ekofisk South, improved drilling and well performance in Norway and lower planned downtime, were equally offset by normal field decline and the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya.

   Asia Pacific and Middle East       
   The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar, as
well as exploration activities in Brunei. During 2015, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 33 percent of our natural gas production.  
  2015 vs. 2014     Asia Pacific and Middle East reported a
loss of $406 million in 2015, compared with income of $3,008 million in 2014. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower prices across all commodities. Earnings in 2015 were further decreased by a $1,502 million before- and after-tax
charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment, higher DD A expense from increased volumes, primarily in Malaysia, and a $41 million after-tax charge for the impairment of our relinquished Palangkaraya PSC. The earnings decrease was partially
offset by lower production taxes, increased volumes, as well as lower feedstock costs and reduced turnarounds at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility.  
      52  

Table of Contents  

  See the  APLNG  section of Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the impairment of our APLNG investment included within the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment.  
 Average production increased 9 percent in 2015, compared with 2014. The production increase was mainly attributable to new production from Gumusut, in
Malaysia, which came online in the fourth quarter of 2014; the ramp-up of APLNG production due to additional gas processing facilities online; and infill drilling in China. Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.  
  2014 vs. 2013     Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings
decreased 16 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. The reduction in earnings was largely due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices; higher operating expenses, mostly as a result of major planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG
facility in Australia; lower equity earnings, mainly due to increased activity at APLNG in preparation for startup in 2015; and lower sales volumes, primarily crude oil and LNG. These decreases were partially offset by higher LNG prices, higher
natural gas volumes and lower taxes. The 2014 benefits from the absence of the $116 million after-tax charge in 2013 related to Bohai Bay and a $30 million after-tax legal settlement in 2014 were offset by the absence of a $146 million
after-tax insurance settlement received in 2013, also associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents.    Average production increased 2 percent in 2014
compared with 2013. Increased production, mainly from Indonesia, China and Malaysia, was largely offset by normal field decline and major planned maintenance at Bayu-Undan and Darwin LNG.  
  Other International       
   The Other International segment includes exploration activities in Colombia, Angola and Senegal. In 2015, Other International
contributed less than 1 percent of our worldwide liquids production. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our 50 percent interest in the Polar Lights Company.  
  2015 vs. 2014     Other International operations reported a
loss of $593 million in 2015, compared with a loss of $100 million in 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to after-tax charges of $235 million, $75 million and $32 million net for property impairments on our Angola Block 36, Angola
Block 37 and Poland leasehold, respectively. Earnings were also reduced due to increased dry hole expenses for the Omosi-1 and Vali-1 wells in Angola and the absence of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution
of  
      53  

Table of Contents  

  a contingent liability. The reduction in earnings was partly offset by the absence of the $136 million after-tax
charge in 2014 for the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore Angola; and a $53 million after-tax gain from the disposition of our interest in the Polar Lights Company.  
 For additional information on the impairments, see Note 9 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Average production was flat in 2015 compared with 2014.  
  2014 vs. 2013     Other International operations reported a
loss of $100 million in 2014, compared with earnings of $223 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the lower gains from asset dispositions, mainly from the absence of the $288 million after-tax gain recognized on the 2013 disposition of
our equity investment in Phoenix Park Processors Limited, located in Trinidad and Tobago and higher dry hole expenses, mostly due to the $136 million after-tax charge for the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located offshore Angola. These reductions
were partially offset by the recognition of other income of $154 million after-tax associated with the favorable resolution of a contingent liability.  
 Average production was flat in 2014 compared with 2013.  
  Corporate and Other       
    2015 vs. 2014     Net
interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily as a result of
lower capitalized interest on projects completed or sold and increased debt. The 2015 net interest expense increase was largely offset by a $148 million net tax benefit for electing the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense in
the United States for prior years.    Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 27 percent in 2015, mainly due to $143 million in after-tax
pension settlement expense, partially offset by lower staff and compensation plan costs.    Technology includes our investment in new technologies or
businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands, unconventional reservoirs, LNG, and subsurface, arctic and deepwater technologies, with an underlying commitment to environmental responsibility.
Earnings from Technology were $122 million in 2015, compared with losses of $93 million in 2014. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher licensing revenues.  
 The category  Other  includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in
operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment.  Other  expenses increased by $82 million in 2015, mainly due to $142 million after-tax in restructuring charges and foreign currency translation impacts,
partially offset by lower environmental expenses.

   2014 vs. 2013   
 Net interest decreased 5 percent in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily as a result of a $93 million tax benefit associated with the election of the fair
market value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States, as well as a $28 million after-tax benefit associated with interest on a favorable tax settlement. These improvements were largely offset by lower capitalized interest on
projects sold or completed.    Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2014, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense,
partly offset by higher benefit-related expenses. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax. We did not incur pension settlement expense in 2014.  
 Losses from Technology were $93 million in 2014, compared with losses of $6 million in 2013. The reduction in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing
revenues and higher research and development expenses.

   CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY   
  Financial Indicators       
        *Capital includes total debt and total equity.   
    **Includes effect of interest rate swaps in 2013.   
 To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the
primary source of funding. In addition, during 2015 we received $1,952 million in proceeds from asset sales and issued $2,498 million of new fixed and floating rate notes. The primary uses of our available cash were $10,050 million to support
our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $3,664 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $103 million to repay debt. During 2015, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,694 million, to $2,368 million.  
 In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf
registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the  Significant
Sources of Capital  section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments.  
  Significant Sources of Capital       Operating
Activities      During 2015, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $7,572 million, a 54 percent decrease from 2014. The decrease was
primarily due to lower prices across all commodities and the absence of the $1.3 billion distribution from FCCL in the first quarter of 2014, partly offset by year-over-year production growth. The distribution from FCCL resulted from our $2.8
billion prepayment of the remaining joint venture acquisition obligation in 2013, which substantially increased the financial flexibility of our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. We do not expect this individually significant distribution to recur
in the future under current economic conditions. During 2014, cash provided by continuing operations was $16,412 million, compared with $15,856 million in 2013.  
 While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly
dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating
factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.    The level of absolute production
volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Our 2015 production averaged 1,589 MBOED. We expect 2016 production to be flat with 2015 production of 1,525 MBOED, which excludes 64 MBOED for the full-year impact of
completed dispositions. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas  
      56  

Table of Contents  

price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field
production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and
cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.  
 To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2015 was negative 19 percent.
Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 10 percent of 2015 production. Over the five-year period ended December 31, 2015, our reserve replacement was 96 percent (including 54 percent from
consolidated operations) reflecting the impact of asset dispositions. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 117 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions
(revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. In the event we undertake any cash conservation efforts, our reserve replacement efforts could be
delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserves. For additional information about our 2016 capital budget, see the  2016 Capital Budget  section within  Capital Resources and Liquidity  and for additional
information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the  Oil and Gas Operations  section of this report.    As
discussed in the  Critical Accounting Estimates  section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more
technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2015, revisions decreased reserves, while in 2014 and 2013, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.  
   Investing Activities      Proceeds from asset sales in
2015 were $2.0 billion, primarily from the sales of certain western Canadian properties; producing properties in East Texas and North Louisiana and in South Texas; a certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas; and our 50 percent equity
method investment in the Russian joint venture, Polar Lights Company. This compares with proceeds of $1.6 billion in 2014, primarily from the sale of our Nigeria upstream affiliates for net proceeds of $1.4 billion, after customary adjustments,
inclusive of deposits previously received. For additional information, see Note 3 Discontinued Operations, and Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to optimize our asset
portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling non-core assets. For additional information regarding marketing activities, see the  Outlook  section within Management s Discussion
and Analysis.    In May 2015, we liquidated certain deferred compensation investments for proceeds of $267 million, which is included in the
 Other  line within  Cash Flows From Investing Activities  on our consolidated statement of cash flows. We do not expect further material liquidations associated with deferred compensation investments. For additional information,
see Note 15 Fair Value Measurement, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows from investing activities in 2014 were impacted by the $454 million receipt of the Freeport LNG loan repayment.  
   Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities      During
2015, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.0 billion expiring in June 2019. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, for the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our
commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit
ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.  
      57  

Table of Contents  

  Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the
London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also
contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.    Our primary
funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.1 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $900 million
commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no direct borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. Under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding
Ltd. commercial paper programs, $803 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2015, compared with $860 million at December 31, 2014. Since we had $803 million of commercial paper outstanding and had
issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.2 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015.    In
August 2015, Moody s Investors Service downgraded our senior long-term debt ratings to  A2  from  A1 , with a stable outlook. In February 2016, Standard and Poor s placed our long-term and short-term corporate credit
ratings on CreditWatch with Negative Implications. Due to the recent significant decline in commodity prices and the expectation these prices could remain depressed in the near future, the major ratings agencies have indicated they will be
conducting a review of the oil and gas industry. During the first quarter of 2016, the credit ratings for several companies in the oil and gas industry were downgraded, and we expect further downgrades may broadly impact the industry during the
first half of 2016. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a further downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating
were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.  
 Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and
instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had direct bank letters of credit of $340 million and $802 million, respectively, which secured performance
obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.      Shelf Registration    
 We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have
the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue
business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.    For information about guarantees, see Note
12 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.     Capital Requirements   
 For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the  Capital Expenditures  section.  
 Our debt balance at December 31, 2015, was $24.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the balance at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result
of the May 2015 issuance of $2.5 billion in new fixed and floating rate notes. Our short-term debt balance at December 31, 2015, increased $1.2 billion compared with  
      58  

Table of Contents  

December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled maturities. We expect to pursue financing options in 2016 to provide additional capital to finance our operations and to
partially refinance some of our long-term borrowings, which may include offerings of additional notes from time to time depending on market conditions. For more information, see Note 11 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
   We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. In
December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the  Other  line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows.  
 In October 2015, we announced a dividend of 74 cents per share. The dividend was paid December 1, 2015, to stockholders of record at the close of
business on October 19, 2015. On February 4, 2016, we announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share, compared with the previous quarterly dividend of 74 cents per share. We believe this effort will allow
us to preserve our balance sheet strength and provide financial flexibility through the current downturn. The dividend will be paid March 1, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2016.  
  Contractual Obligations        The following
table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations of our continuing    operations as of December 31, 2015:  

(a) 
 Includes $284 million of net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. See Note 11 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.    

(b) 
 Capital lease obligations are presented on a discounted basis.        

(c) 
 Operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted basis.    
      59  

Table of Contents  

(d) 
 Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, presented on an undiscounted basis. Does not include purchase commitments for
jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator.      The majority of the purchase obligations are
market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $3,986 million.  
 Purchase obligations of $6,664 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities,
including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are
the operator.      

(e) 
 Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2016 through 2020. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2020, see
Note 18 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.        

(f) 
 Represents estimated discounted costs to retire and remove long-lived assets at the end of their operations.        

(g) 
 Represents estimated costs for accrued environmental expenditures presented on a discounted basis for costs acquired in various business combinations and an undiscounted basis for all other accrued environmental costs.

(h) 
 Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $413 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are
not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.       Capital
Expenditures       
 
   Working capital changes associated with
investing activities increased cash used in investing activities by $968 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with a decrease of $180 million for the corresponding period of 2014, and an increase of $55 million for the
corresponding period of 2013. The increase in cash used in investing activities as of December 31, 2015, is attributable to reduced capital accruals, as compared with December 31, 2014, from lower activity levels in 2015, primarily in the
Lower 48 and Canada.  
      60  

Table of Contents  

  Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended
December 31, 2015, totaled $42.7 billion. The 2015 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily:      

Oil and natural gas development and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Permian Basin.    

Major project expenditures associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia.    

Oil sands development, notably at Surmont 2, and ongoing liquids-rich plays in Canada.    

Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area, Greater Prudhoe Area and the Western North Slope.    

In Europe, development activities in the Greater Ekofisk, Aasta Hansteen, Clair Ridge, Jasmine and Greater Britannia areas, and exploration and appraisal activities in the Jasmine and Greater Clair areas.

Exploration and appraisal drilling in deepwater Gulf of Mexico.    

Continued development in Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Timor-Leste and offshore Australia, and exploration and appraisal activity in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and offshore Australia.    

Exploration activities in Angola and Senegal.      2016 CAPITAL BUDGET  
 In anticipation of ongoing weak commodity prices in 2016, our capital budget was reduced in February 2016 from the previously announced $7.7 billion to $6.4
billion, a decrease of 37 percent compared with 2015 capital expenditures of $10.1 billion. The reduction in capital relative to 2015 primarily reflects lower major project spending, deflation capture, deferral of activity and efficiency
improvements.    We are planning to allocate approximately:      

34 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. These funds will focus predominantly on the Lower 48 unconventionals including the Eagle Ford and Bakken, as well as development
drilling in Canada, Alaska, the Greater Ekofisk Area, and in legacy assets within Asia Pacific and Middle East.    

31 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on startup of APLNG Train 2, as well as major projects in Alaska, Europe, Malaysia and China.    

18 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to exploration and appraisal activity. These funds will primarily target the Gulf of Mexico, Senegal, Nova Scotia, and Alaska.    

17 percent of our 2016 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production and corporate expenditures.    
 For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the  Oil and Gas Operations  section.  
  Contingencies     A number of lawsuits involving a variety
of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and
petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a
liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do
not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative
probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.  
      61  

Table of Contents  

  Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent
liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For information on other contingencies, see  Critical Accounting Estimates  and Note
13 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.      Legal and Tax Matters    
 We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement
and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims
of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.    Our legal organization
applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation
and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management
tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
See Note 19 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax related contingencies.  
   Environmental      We are subject to the same numerous
international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:  

U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.    

U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.    

European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).    

U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance
releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.    

U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.    

U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators
of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.    

U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.

U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.    

U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential
liability for pollution damages.    

European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.      These laws and their
implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an
applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the  
      62  

Table of Contents  

application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency s processing of the application.
Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.    Many states and foreign countries where we operate
also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and
difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.    The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws
and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including
those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include
air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada.    An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential
completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with
hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions
on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government
requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.    We also are subject to certain laws and regulations
relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may
fluctuate significantly.    We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies
alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert
potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2015, there were 14 sites around the United States in which we
were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws.    For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be
significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially
responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they
have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies
concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.
Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of
remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.  
      63  

Table of Contents  

  Expensed environmental costs were $485 million in 2015 and are expected to be about $478 million per
year in 2016 and 2017. Capitalized environmental costs were $303 million in 2015 and are expected to be about $250 million per year in 2016 and 2017.  
 Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except
those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).    Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and
similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also
includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other
third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.    Remediation activities vary substantially in duration
and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it
is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.    At December 31, 2015, our balance sheet included total accrued
environmental costs of $258 million, compared with $344 million at December 31, 2014, for remediation activities in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
   Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent
concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as
a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.      Climate Change    
 There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or
promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our
future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our
operations include:      

European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2015 was approximately $0.4
million (net share pre-tax).    

In Canada during 2015, the Alberta government amended the regulations of the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulations now require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric
tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce its net emissions intensity from its baseline. The reduction is increasing from the current 12 percent in 2015, to 15 percent in 2016 and to 20 percent in 2017. We also incur a carbon
tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these regulations in 2015 was approximately $4.7 million.

2010)), and the EPA s and U.S. Department of Transportation s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may
result in longer agency review time for development projects.    

The U.S. EPA s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The current
U.S. administration has established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025.    

Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2015 was approximately $31 million (net share pre-tax).    

The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions.
     In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to
GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required
acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.  
 Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs,
reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural
gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:      

Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.    

The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.    

The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation.    

The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax).    

The GHG reductions required.    

The price and availability of offsets.    

The amount and allocation of allowances.    

Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.    

Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).    

Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.

  The company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual
business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas:      

Equipping the company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market
transactions.    

Reducing GHG emissions In 2014, the company reduced or avoided GHG emissions by approximately 900,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units.    

Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies.    

Engaging externally The company is a sponsor of MIT s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and
discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.      The company uses an
estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $8 to $35 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities.  
  Other     We have deferred tax assets related to certain
accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our
expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income.

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting
policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major
accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different
assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the
discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.     Oil and Gas Accounting   
 Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and
geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the
balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.      Property Acquisition Costs
     For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For
relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with
others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold
acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.  
 This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable
exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2015, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively
small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $515 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $191 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was
approximately 74 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pre-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2016 would
increase by approximately $7 million. At year-end 2015, the remaining $4,501 million of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership,
exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 12 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved
properties in 2016. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.  
   Exploratory Costs      For exploratory wells, drilling
costs are temporarily capitalized, or  suspended,  on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a
producing well.  
      67  

Table of Contents  

  If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized
on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of  sufficient progress  is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules
do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the
development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing
such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex
exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek
government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in
exploration expense.    Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and
seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir
characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment.  
 At year-end 2015, total suspended well costs were $1,260 million, compared with $1,299 million at year-end 2014. For additional information on
suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8 Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   Proved Reserves       Engineering estimates of the
quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place
hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the
quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.    Despite the inherent
imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of  proved  reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company s
operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as  proved.  Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and
procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.  
 Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production
and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.
This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices
decline and increase as prices rise.  
      68  

Table of Contents  

  Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the
 economic interest  method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of
costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.  
 The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the
denominator in the   unit-of-production   calculation of the DD A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2015, the net book value of productive
properties, plants and equipment (PP E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $58 billion and the DD A recorded on these assets in 2015 was approximately $8.7 billion. The estimated proved developed
reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.6 billion BOE at the end of 2014 and 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2015. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all
calculations, pre-tax DD A in 2015 would have increased by an estimated $960 million.     Impairments   
 Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in
future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is
monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the
carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of
impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow
validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes,
commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 9 Impairments, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.    Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are
reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained
earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for
the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the
investee s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market
prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of
comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.

   Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs   
 Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of
operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in
Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset
removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event
actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.  
 Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD A over the remaining life of the
assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings,
because any increase in PP E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.  
 In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These
are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change
due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See
Note 10 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.  
  Projected Benefit Obligations     Determination of the
projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial
determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates
of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of
these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental
assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the
actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns,
but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A
1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $1,100 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent
decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $100 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining
the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year
could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of  
      70  

Table of Contents  

unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there
is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or elimination for a significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services, we could recognize a curtailment
gain or loss. See Note 18 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.     Contingencies
    A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to
accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingences, we reassess our position
both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or
other third party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated
future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the
 Contingencies  section within  Capital Resources and Liquidity.

ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and
uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have
expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:      

Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels.    

The impact of recent, significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, which may result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and
nonconsolidated equity investments.    

Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting
reserves and reservoir performance.    

Inability to maintain reserves replacement rates consistent with prior periods, whether as a result of the recent, significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise.    

Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage.    

Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities.    

Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or
water disposal.    

Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids.    

Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; comply with government regulations; or make capital
expenditures required to maintain compliance.    

Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development.    

Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism, cyber attacks or infrastructure constraints or disruptions.

International monetary conditions and exchange controls, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.    

Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations, use of competing energy sources or the development of alternative energy sources.

     Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
     Financial Instrument Market Risk     We and
certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and
commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.  
 Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an  Authority Limitations  document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of
highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief
Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Vice President of Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning monitors commodity
price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.  
   Commodity Price Risk      Our Commercial organization
uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:      

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating
market prices.    

Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to
optimize these activities.      We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the
effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015,
as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was immaterial to our
consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was also immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to
ConocoPhillips.      Interest Rate Risk      The
following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity
dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted
market prices.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk    
 We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate
changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates
to be remitted within the coming year.    At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial
activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the
change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position
in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2015, or 2014, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at
December 31, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:

Report of Management   
 Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing in this annual report. The consolidated
financial statements present fairly the company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the
company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company s financial statements have been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst   Young LLP all of the company s financial records and related data, as well as
the minutes of stockholders  and directors  meetings.     Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips  internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.    Management assessed the effectiveness of the company s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in  Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment, we believe the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.  
 Ernst   Young LLP has issued an audit report on the company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, and their

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders    ConocoPhillips  
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the related condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at
Item 8 and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule based on our audits.    We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.    In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.    We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ConocoPhillips  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 23, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders    ConocoPhillips  
 We have audited ConocoPhillips  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in  Internal
Control Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips  management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading  Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  in the accompanying  Report of
Management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.    We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based
on the COSO criteria.    We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2015
consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report dated February 23, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  ConocoPhillips   
 
   Note 1 Accounting Policies   

Consolidation Principles and Investments  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary
beneficiary. The equity method is used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates  operating and financial policies. When we do not have the ability to exert
significant influence, the investment is either classified as available-for-sale if fair value is readily determinable, or the cost method is used if fair value is not readily determinable. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures,
pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.    
 We manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia
Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. Effective November 1, 2015, the Other International and historically presented Europe segments were restructured to align with changes to our internal organization structure. The Libya business
was moved from the Other International segment to the historically presented Europe segment, which is now renamed Europe and North Africa. Certain financial information has been revised for all prior periods presented to reflect the change in the
composition of our operating segments. For additional information, see Note 24 Segment Disclosures and Related Information. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our
continuing operations.      

Foreign Currency Translation  Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
common stockholders  equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Most of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.    

Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.    

Revenue Recognition  Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer, which
is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs, either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry.    
 Revenues associated with producing properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we
sold during the period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working interest, which are deemed to be nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable,
as appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant.    Revenues associated
with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into  in contemplation  of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income
statement line).      

Shipping and Handling Costs  We include shipping and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in
purchased commodities. Freight costs billed to customers are recorded as a component of revenue.        

Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase.
They are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.    
      86  

Table of Contents  

Short-Term Investments  Investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) with original maturities of greater than 90 days but less than one year are
classified as short-term investments.        

Inventories  We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory. Commodity-related inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current
inventory costs with current revenues. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs.
Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, consistent with industry
practice.        

Fair Value Measurements  We categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs
are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated
inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.    

Derivative Instruments  Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the
same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.    
 Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose
for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses from
adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item.  

Oil and Gas Exploration and Development  Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.    
  Property Acquisition Costs  Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption
properties, plants and equipment (PP E). Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management s judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated
leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.     Exploratory Costs  Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of
carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or  suspended,  on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found.
If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as
sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several
years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the  
      87  

Table of Contents  

  potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development
plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.  
 Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work,
and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 8 Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, for additional information on suspended
wells.     Development Costs  Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are
capitalized.     Depletion and Amortization  Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production
method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.  

Capitalized Interest  Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying
asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.        

Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization of PP E on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain pipeline assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are
determined by the unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other PP E are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly
integrated with other units).        

Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment  PP E used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future
cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by
management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of
the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provisions and reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made. Individual assets
are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production
assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent
with those used by principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are
accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.    
 The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production
volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review. The impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that
production. Additionally, when probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.  
      88  

Table of Contents  

Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities  Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred
and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired
investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable
assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.        

Maintenance and Repairs  Costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred.    

Property Dispositions  When complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the  Gain on
dispositions  line of our consolidated income statement. When less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs  The fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred (typically when
the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we
will record an adjustment to both the liability and PP E. Over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in PP E is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. For additional
information, see Note 10 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs.      Environmental expenditures
are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental
expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs
from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.      

Guarantees  The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the
guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we
have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line
item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair
value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.        

Share-Based Compensation  We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start
of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff
vesting.    
      89

Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities,
except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are
applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating
expenses.        

Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities  Sales and value-added taxes are recorded net.        

Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock  Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year,
including unallocated shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Also, this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock, along with an adjustment to net
income (loss) for dividend equivalents paid on unvested unit awards that are considered participating securities. Diluted net income per share of common stock includes unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and
vested but unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share, primarily under the treasury-stock method. Diluted net loss per share, which is calculated the same as basic net loss per share, does not
assume conversion or exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock and shares held by grantor trusts are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. The earnings
per share impact of the participating securities is immaterial.    
   Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles   
  We adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-08,
 Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,  on a prospective basis, beginning January 1, 2015. The ASU amends the criteria for reporting discontinued operations to include only
disposals representing a strategic shift in operations that have or will have a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results. The ASU also requires entities to provide additional disclosures about discontinued operations as well
as certain other significant disposal transactions that do not meet the revised discontinued operations reporting criteria. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. See Note
3 Discontinued Operations, and Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold, for additional information on our dispositions.    Effective December 31,
2015, we early adopted, on a prospective basis, FASB ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The ASU requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowances, to be
offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet for each tax-paying component within a tax jurisdiction. See Note 19 Income Taxes, for additional information.  
   Note 3 Discontinued Operations   
  In 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigeria and Algeria
businesses (collectively, the  Disposition Group ). The Disposition Group was previously part of the Other International operating segment. We completed the sales of Kashagan and our Algeria business in the fourth quarter of 2013. We sold
our Nigeria business in the third quarter of 2014.    On November 26, 2012, we notified government authorities in Kazakhstan and co-venturers of our
intent to sell the company s 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan to ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL). On July 2, 2013, we received notification from the government of Kazakhstan indicating it was exercising its right to pre-empt the  
      90  

Table of Contents  

proposed sale to OVL and designating KazMunayGas (KMG) as the entity to acquire the interest. On October 31, 2013, we completed the transaction with KMG for total proceeds of $5,392 million
and recognized a pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in the  Income from discontinued operations  line on our consolidated income statement. At the time of disposition, the carrying value of the net assets related to our
interest in Kashagan was $5,370 million, which included $212 million of other current assets, $239 million of long-term receivables, $5,149 million of PP E, $144 million of other current liabilities, and $86 million of asset retirement
obligations (ARO).    On December 18, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Pertamina to sell our wholly owned subsidiary, ConocoPhillips Algeria
Ltd. On November 27, 2013, we completed the transaction with Pertamina, resulting in proceeds of $1,652 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $938 million, which is included in the  Income from discontinued operations  line on our
consolidated income statement. At the time of disposition, the net carrying value of our Algerian assets was $714 million, which included $48 million of other current assets, $883 million of PP E, $41 million of other current liabilities, $37
million of ARO, and $139 million of deferred taxes.    On December 20, 2012, we entered into agreements with affiliates of Oando PLC to sell our
Nigeria business and on July 30, 2014, we completed the sale for $1,359 million, inclusive of $550 million deposits previously received. The deposits had been included in the  Other accruals  line on our consolidated balance sheet and
in the  Other  line of cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. The deposits received included $435 million in 2012, $15 million in 2013, and $100 million in 2014. We recognized a before-tax gain of
$1,052 million, which is included in the  Income from discontinued operations  line on our consolidated income statement. At the time of disposition, the net carrying value of the upstream assets was $307 million, which included $233
million of other current assets, $1,211 million of PP E, $298 million of other current liabilities, $14 million of ARO, and $825 million of deferred taxes.  
 Sales and other operating revenues and income from discontinued operations related to the Disposition Group during 2014 and 2013 were as follows:  
 
   Note 4 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)   
  We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. Information on
our significant VIE follows:     Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG)   
 APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support. We
are not the primary beneficiary of APLNG because we share with Origin Energy and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) the power to direct the key activities of APLNG that most significantly impact its economic performance, which involve
activities related to the production and commercialization of coalbed methane, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate APLNG, and it is accounted for as an equity method investment.  
      91  

Table of Contents  

  As of December 31, 2015, we have not provided any financial support to APLNG other than amounts previously
contractually required. Unless we elect otherwise, we have no requirement to provide liquidity or purchase the assets of APLNG. See Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 12 Guarantees, for additional information.
 
   Note 5 Inventories   
  Inventories at December 31 were:  
   
   As a result of further declining commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a lower of cost or market
adjustment of $44 million to our commodity inventories, which is included in the  Purchased commodities  line on our consolidated income statement. Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $317 million and $440 million
at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories was approximately $6 million at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In 2015, liquidation of
LIFO inventory values increased the net loss from continuing operations by $25 million.  
   Note 6 Assets Held for Sale or Sold   
   Assets Held for Sale     On
February 4, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field in the Cook Inlet. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.  
  Assets Sold     All gains or losses are reported before-tax
and are included net in the  Gain on dispositions  line on our consolidated income statement.      2015    
 In November 2015, we sold a portion of our western Canadian properties located in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan for $198 million and recognized a
gain on disposition of $66 million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interest, which was included in the Canada segment, was $132 million, which included primarily $379 million of PP E and $248 million of ARO.  
 In December 2015, we sold a portion of our western Canadian properties located in central Alberta for $130 million and recognized a loss on disposition
of $235 million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interest, which was included in the Canada segment, was approximately $365 million, which included primarily $488 million of PP E and $126 million of ARO.  
 Additionally, other December 2015 disposition transactions are summarized below.  
 We sold producing properties in East Texas and Northern Louisiana for $412 million and recognized a gain on disposition of $189 million. At the time of the
disposition, the carrying value of our interest, which was included in the Lower 48 segment, was $223 million, which included $351 million of PP E and $128 million of ARO.  
      92  

Table of Contents  

  We sold certain gas producing properties in South Texas for $358 million and recognized a gain on disposition of
$201 million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interest, which was included in the Lower 48 segment, was $157 million, which included $369 million of PP E and $212 million of ARO.  
 We sold certain pipeline and gathering assets in South Texas for $201 million and recognized a gain on disposition of $193 million. At the time of the
disposition, the carrying value of our interest, which was included in the Lower 48 segment, was $8 million, which primarily included $24 million of PP E and $18 million of ARO.  
 We also sold our 50 percent interest in the Russian joint venture, Polar Lights Company, for $98 million and recognized a gain on disposition of $58
million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our equity method investment in Polar Lights Company, which was included in our Other International segment, was approximately $40 million.  
   2014      For information on the sale of our Nigeria
business, which is included in the  Income from discontinued operations  line on our consolidated income statement, see Note 3 Discontinued Operations.  
   2013      In March 2013, we sold the majority of our
producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline for $994 million and recognized a loss on disposition of $43 million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interest, which was included in the Lower 48 segment, was $1,037 million,
which included primarily $1,066 million of PP E and $28 million of ARO.    In June 2013, we sold a portion of our working interests in the Browse
and Canning basins for $402 million. Because we retain a working interest in the unproved properties, proceeds were treated as a reduction of the carrying value of PP E with no gain or loss on disposition recognized. Prior to the partial
disposition, the carrying value of the PP E associated with our interests, included in our Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, was $486 million.    In
August 2013, we sold our interest in the Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold for $724 million and recognized a gain on disposition of $614 million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interest in Clyden, which was included
in the Canada segment, was $110 million and was primarily classified as PP E.    In August 2013, we also sold our 39 percent interest in Phoenix Park
Gas Processors Limited for $593 million and recognized a gain on disposition of $417 million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our equity investment in Phoenix Park, which was included in our Other International segment,
was $176 million.    For information on the Kashagan and Algeria sales, which are included in the  Income from discontinued operations  line on

   APLNG     APLNG
is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position.
The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long term sales and purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, is the operator
of APLNG s production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.    APLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion
project finance facility during the third quarter of 2012. The $8.5 billion project finance facility is composed of financing agreements executed by APLNG with the Export-Import Bank of the United States for approximately $2.9 billion, the
Export-Import Bank of China for approximately $2.7 billion, and a syndicate of Australian and international commercial banks for approximately $2.9 billion. At December 31, 2015, $8.4 billion had been drawn from the facility. In connection with
the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility which will be released upon meeting certain completion milestones. See Note 12 Guarantees, for additional
information.    APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated
financial support. See Note 4 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) for additional information.    During 2015, the outlook for crude oil and natural gas
prices sharply deteriorated, and as a result of these significantly reduced price outlooks, the estimated fair value of our investment in APLNG declined to an amount below book value during the fourth quarter of 2015.  
 Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded that the impairment was other than temporary under the
guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 323,  Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures,  and the recognition of an impairment of our investment to fair value was necessary. In reaching this conclusion, we
primarily considered the severity of the current decline of commodity prices as well as the market outlook. Fair value has been estimated based on an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices from futures
exchanges and pricing service companies, costs, foreign currency rates and a discount factor that is believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.  
 Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $1,502 million, before- and after-tax impairment, in our fourth-quarter 2015 results. The impairment, which is included in
the  Impairments  line on our consolidated income statement, had the effect of reducing our book value to $10,185 million, based on the present value of discounted expected future cash flows as of December 31, 2015.  
 At December 31, 2015, the book value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $10,185 million, net of a $1,522 million reduction due to
cumulative foreign currency translation effects. Effective October 1, 2015, in conjunction with APLNG Train 1 achieving first LNG during the fourth quarter, we changed the functional currency of our investment in APLNG from Australian dollar to
U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we expect the currency translation adjustment associated with our investment balance to remain unchanged going forward. The historical cost basis of our 37.5 percent share of net assets on the books of APLNG under U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles was $7,470 million, resulting in a basis difference of $2,715 million on our books. The basis difference, which is substantially all associated with PP E and subject to amortization, has been
allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual exploration and production license areas owned by APLNG, some of which are not currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each
exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference amortization. As the joint venture produces natural gas from each license, we
amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was after-tax expense of $21 million, $24 million and
$16 million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently producing licenses.

   FCCL     FCCL
Partnership, a Canadian upstream 50/50 general partnership with Cenovus Energy Inc., produces bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta and sells the bitumen blend. We account for our investment in FCCL under the equity method of
accounting, with the operating results of our investment in FCCL converted to reflect the use of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.  
 At December 31, 2015, the book value of our investment in FCCL was $8,165 million, net of a $1,955 million reduction due to cumulative foreign currency
translation effects. FCCL s operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Cenovus is the
operator and managing partner of FCCL.    We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period that began in
2007. In December 2013, we repaid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the  Other  line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrued
at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the  Capital expenditures and investments  line on our
consolidated statement of cash flows. In the first quarter of 2014, we received a $1.3 billion distribution from FCCL, which is included in the  Undistributed equity earnings  line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.  
  QG3     QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated
large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance of $804 million as described below under  Loans and Long-Term Receivables.  At December 31, 2015, the book value of our equity
method investment in QG3, excluding the project financing, was $808 million. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, in which we have a
12.4 percent interest, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. However, currently the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the United States.
    Loans and Long-Term Receivables     As part of our
normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans and long-term receivables to certain affiliated and
non-affiliated companies. Loans are recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or non-affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding
loan balance and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreement s stated interest rate. Loans and long-term receivables are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance
may not be fully recovered.    Through November 2014, we had an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in an LNG
receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We had no ownership in Freeport LNG; however, we had a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc. (Freeport GP), which serves as the general partner managing the venture. We had entered into a credit
agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity, which would
have expired in 2033. When the terminal became operational in June 2008, we began making payments under the terminal use agreement. Freeport LNG began making loan repayments in September 2008.  
 In July 2013, we reached an agreement with Freeport LNG to terminate our long-term agreement at the Freeport LNG Terminal, subject to Freeport LNG obtaining
regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG liquefaction and export facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant. These conditions were satisfied in 2014, and we paid Freeport LNG a termination fee of $522 million. Freeport LNG
repaid the outstanding $454 million ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport LNG to partially fund the original construction  
      96  

Table of Contents  

of the terminal. The payment made to Freeport LNG to terminate our long-term agreement is included in the cash flows from operating activities section on our consolidated statement of cash flows,
while the receipt of the funds from Freeport LNG to repay the outstanding loan is included in the cash flows from investing activities section. These transactions, plus miscellaneous items, including the disposal of our 50 percent interest in
Freeport GP, resulted in a one-time net cash outflow of $63 million for us. In addition, we recognized an after-tax charge to earnings of $540 million in 2014, and our terminal regasification capacity has been reduced from 0.9 billion cubic
feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day, until July 1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero.    At December 31, 2015, significant
loans to affiliated companies include $804 million in project financing to QG3. We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, for which we use the equity method of accounting. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum and
Mitsui. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The
ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants.
Semi-annual repayments began in January 2011 and will extend through July 2022.    The long-term portion of these loans is included in the  Loans and
advances related parties  line on our consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in  Accounts and notes receivable related parties.

  The following table provides a further aging of those exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for more
than one year since the completion of drilling as of December 31, 2015:      
    (1)Additional appraisal wells planned.   
  (2)Appraisal drilling complete; costs being incurred to assess development.   
 In line with our July 2015 announcement of plans to reduce future deepwater exploration spending, we recognized before-tax cancellation costs of $335 million
and wrote off $48 million of before-tax capitalized rig costs in relation to the termination of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco in the Lower 48 segment in the third quarter of 2015.  
 In the fourth quarter of 2015, we impaired our leasehold cost associated with Block 36 in Angola due to the lack of commerciality of future prospects. We
drilled one of our two-well commitment under the Angola Block 36 Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and recorded a before-tax charge of $93 million for potential future obligations. 
 These charges are included in the  Exploration expenses  line on our consolidated income statement.

Note 9 Impairments   
  During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized the following before-tax impairment charges:  
   
     2015      See the
 APLNG  section of Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for information on the impairment of our APLNG investment included within the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment.  
 In Europe, we recorded impairments of $724 million, primarily in the United Kingdom as a result of lower natural gas prices and increases to asset retirement
obligations.    The charges discussed below, within this section, are included in the  Exploration expenses  line on our consolidated income
statement and are not reflected in the table above.    In the second and fourth quarters of 2015, we decided not to pursue further evaluation of our Block
37 and Block 36 leases in Angola, respectively, due to lack of commerciality of wells. Accordingly, we recorded impairments of $116 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $377 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 for the associated carrying
values of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs.    In the third quarter of 2015, we decided not to conduct further activity on certain Gulf of Mexico
leases, given our strategic plans to reduce deepwater exploration spending, and to relinquish our Palangkaraya PSC in Indonesia. Accordingly, we recorded impairments of $240 million and $105 million, respectively, for the associated carrying values
of capitalized undeveloped leasehold cost.    In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded impairments of $575 million, $159 million and $102 million for the
associated carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold cost in the Chukchi Sea in Alaska; the Gila prospect in deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas in Canada, respectively. These impairments were
driven by the lack of commerciality of wells, regulatory uncertainty and the expiration of our leases.      2014    
 In Alaska, we recorded impairments of $59 million, primarily due to a cancelled project.  
 In our Lower 48 segment, we recorded impairments of $208 million, primarily as a result of reduced volume forecasts for an onshore field, as well as an
LNG-related pipeline.    We recorded impairments of $38 million in our Canada segment, primarily due to reduced volume forecasts and lower natural gas
prices.    In Europe, we recorded impairments of $541 million, mainly due to reduced volume forecasts, increases in the ARO and lower natural gas prices for
properties in the United Kingdom which are nearing the end of their useful lives.

  The charges discussed below, within this section, are included in the  Exploration expenses  line on
our consolidated income statement and are not reflected in the table above.    In our Lower 48 segment, we recorded unproved property impairments of $239
million, primarily due to decisions to discontinue further testing of the undeveloped leaseholds.    Additionally, we decided not to pursue future
development of the Amauligak discovery. Accordingly, we recorded a $145 million property impairment for the carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs associated with our Amauligak, Arctic Islands and other Beaufort properties located
offshore Canada.      2013      We recorded property
impairments of $216 million in our Canada segment, mainly as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions, reduced volume forecasts and higher costs.  
 In Europe, we recorded impairments of $301 million, primarily due to ARO revisions for properties in the United Kingdom which are nearing the end of their
useful lives or have ceased production.  
   Note 10 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs   
  Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31 were:  
    *Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet under  Other accruals.    
  Asset Retirement Obligations     We record the fair value of
a liability for an asset retirement obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related PP E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and PP E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value,
while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.    We have numerous asset retirement obligations we are required to
perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of
removal. Our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska.

  During 2015 and 2014, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows:  
   
    Accrued Environmental Costs   
 Total accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $258 million and $344 million, respectively.  
 We had accrued environmental costs of $184 million and $250 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to remediation
activities in the United States and Canada. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $57 million and $79 million of environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In
addition, $17 million and $15 million were included at both December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.    Expected
expenditures for environmental obligations acquired in various business combinations are discounted using a weighted-average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $105 million at
December 31, 2015. The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $12 million in 2016, $13 million in 2017, $9 million in 2018, $6 million in 2019, $4 million
in 2020, and $117 million for all future years after 2020.

Table of Contents  

  Maturities of long-term borrowings, inclusive of net unamortized premiums and discounts, in 2016 through 2020
are: $1,427 million, $1,081 million, $1,859 million, $3,014 million and $1,576 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we classified $695 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the
obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facility.    In May 2015, we issued notes consisting of:  

The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  
 At December 31, 2015, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.0 billion expiring in June 2019. Our revolving credit facility may be used for
direct bank borrowings, for the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any
material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt
obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.    Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a
margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment
fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.  
 We have two commercial paper programs supported by our $7.0 billion revolving credit facility: the ConocoPhillips $6.1 billion program, primarily a funding
source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $900 million program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.  
 At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, with no letters of credit as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, there was $803 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2015, compared with $860 million at December 31,
2014. Since we had $803 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.2 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015.  
 During 2013, a lease of a semi-submersible floating production system (FPS) commenced for the Gumusut development, located in Malaysia, in which we are a
co-venturer. The FPS lease provides for an initial noncancelable term of 15 years, a subsequent 5-year cancelable term with no required lease payments, and an additional 5-year term with terms and conditions to be agreed at a later date. The lease
has no ongoing purchase options or escalation clauses. Adjustments to provisional contingent rental payments may occur due to the finalization of actual commissioning costs. The lease does not impose any significant restrictions concerning
dividends, debt or further leasing activities.    A capital lease asset and capital lease obligation were recognized for our proportionate interest in the
FPS of $906 million, based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments using our pre-tax incremental borrowing rate of 3.58 percent for debt with similar terms. Unitization of the Gumusut development with
 
      103  

Table of Contents  

Brunei was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2014 and reduced our proportionate interest in the FPS from 33 percent to 29 percent. The net carrying value of the capital lease asset was
approximately $707 million and $802 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The capital lease asset is being depreciated over a period consistent with the estimated proved reserves of Gumusut using the
unit-of-production method with the associated depreciation included in the  Depreciation, depletion and amortization  line on our consolidated income statement. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, accumulated
depreciation of the capital lease asset amounted to approximately $122 million and $20 million, respectively.    At December 31, 2015, future minimum
payments due under capital leases were:      
 
   Note 12 Guarantees   
  At December 31, 2015, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We
recognize a liability at inception for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of
the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.  
  APLNG Guarantees     At December 31, 2015, we had
outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 37.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2015 exchange rates:  

We have guaranteed APLNG s performance with regard to a construction contract executed in connection with APLNG s issuance of the Train 1 and Train 2 Notices to Proceed. We estimate the remaining term of this
guarantee is one year. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to this guarantee is approximately $110 million and would become payable if APLNG cancels the applicable construction contract and does not perform with respect to
the amounts owed to the contractor.        

We have issued a construction completion guarantee related to the third-party project financing secured by APLNG. Our maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is estimated to be $3.2 billion,
which could be payable if the full debt financing capacity is utilized and completion of the project is not achieved. Our guarantee of the project financing will be released upon meeting certain completion tests with milestones, which we estimate
should occur beginning in 2016. Our maximum exposure at December 31, 2015, is $3.2 billion based upon our pro-rata share of the facility used at that date. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately $114
million.    
      104  

Table of Contents  

In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under
guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements with remaining terms of 1 to 26 years. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is
estimated to be $1 billion ($1.8 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments
are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.

We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project s continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of up to 30 years or the
life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $160 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform.    
  Other Guarantees     We have other guarantees with maximum
future potential payment amounts totaling approximately $590 million, which consist primarily of guarantees of the residual value of a leased office building, the residual value of leased corporate aircraft, a guarantee for our portion of a
joint venture s project finance reserve accounts, a guarantee to fund the short-term cash liquidity deficit of a joint venture, and a guarantee of minimum charter revenue for an LNG vessel. These guarantees have remaining terms of up to eight
years or the life of the venture and would become payable if, upon sale, certain asset values are lower than guaranteed amounts, business conditions decline at guaranteed entities, or as a result of nonperformance of contractual terms by guaranteed
parties.     Indemnifications     Over the years, we have
entered into agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. These agreements include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, employee claims and
litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying
amount recorded for these indemnifications at December 31, 2015, was approximately $90 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type
of indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our
indemnification exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future
payments. Included in the recorded carrying amount at December 31, 2015, were approximately $40 million of environmental accruals for known contamination that are included in the  Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental
costs  line on our consolidated balance sheet. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 13 Contingencies and Commitments.  
 On April 30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream businesses was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66.
In connection with the separation, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement, which provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and established procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related
matters. We evaluated the impact of the indemnifications given and the Phillips 66 indemnifications received as of the separation date and concluded those fair values were immaterial.  
 On March 1, 2015, a supplier to one of the refineries that was included in Phillips 66 as part of the separation of our Downstream businesses formally
registered Phillips 66 as a party to the supply agreement, thereby triggering a guarantee we provided at the time of separation. Our maximum potential liability for future  
      105

payments under this guarantee, which would become payable if Phillips 66 does not perform its contractual obligations under the supply agreement, is approximately $1.6 billion. At
December 31, 2015, the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately $98 million and the remaining term is nine years. Because Phillips 66 has indemnified us for losses incurred under this guarantee, we have recorded an indemnification
asset from Phillips 66 of approximately $98 million. The recorded indemnification asset amount represents the estimated fair value of the guarantee; however, if we are required to perform under the guarantee, we would expect to recover from Phillips
66 any amounts in excess of that value, provided Phillips 66 is a going concern.  
   Note 13 Contingencies and Commitments   
  A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We
also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for
accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of
amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If
applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than
certain. See Note 19 Income Taxes, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.    Based on currently available information, we
believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning
contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal
matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our
liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation
processes.     Environmental     We are subject to
international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management s best estimates, using all information that
is available at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring
environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies  cleanup experience, and data released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We
consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.  
 Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for
other sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially
responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the agency concerned. Prior to
actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it
appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional  
      106

share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental
obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.  
 We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state and international sites. After an
assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation
activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental
assessments, cleanups and proceedings. See Note 10 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.  
  Legal Proceedings     We are subject to various lawsuits and
claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property damage. Our primary exposures for
such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in
these matters.    Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing
a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases
that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly
assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.     Other
Contingencies     We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing
arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had
performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $340 million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct
of business.    In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an  empresa mixta  structure mandated by
the Venezuelan government s Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela s national oil company, Petr leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips  interests in the
Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the World Bank s International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010. On September 3, 2013, an ICSID arbitration tribunal held that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips 
significant oil investments in June 2007. A separate arbitration phase is currently proceeding to determine the damages owed to ConocoPhillips for Venezuela s actions. On October 10, 2014, we filed a separate arbitration under the rules of
the International Chamber of Commerce against PDVSA for contractual compensation related to the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects.    In 2008,
Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our
production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by  
      107  

Table of Contents  

the ICSID tribunal, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the seized crude oil. In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21,
fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. On April 24, 2012, Ecuador filed supplemental counterclaims asserting environmental damages, which we believe are
not material. The ICSID tribunal issued a decision on liability on December 14, 2012, in favor of Burlington, finding that Ecuador s seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S.
Bilateral Investment Treaty. An additional arbitration phase is now proceeding to determine the damages owed to ConocoPhillips for Ecuador s actions and to address Ecuador s counterclaims.  
 ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax
assessments. The arbitration hearing was conducted in Singapore in June 2014 under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Stability Agreement with the Timor-Leste
government. Post-hearing briefs from both parties were filed in August 2014. In January 2016, the Government of Timor-Leste and ConocoPhillips reached a settlement of several significant tax disputes. However, we await the Tribunal s decision
with respect to certain unresolved matters.     Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements   
 We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or
crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of the company s business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements are: 2016 $27 million; 2017 $27 million; 2018 $22 million;
2019 $7 million; 2020 $7 million; and 2021 and after $80 million. Total payments under the agreements were $27 million in 2015 and $127 million in each of 2014 and 2013.  
   Note 14 Derivative and Financial Instruments   
  We use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to meet our customer needs and capture market opportunities. Our commodity
business primarily consists of natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, LNG and natural gas liquids.    Our derivative instruments are held at fair value on our
consolidated balance sheet. Where these balances have the right of setoff, they are presented on a net basis. Related cash flows are recorded as operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. On our consolidated income statement,
realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized either on a gross basis if directly related to our physical business or a net basis if held for trading. Gains and losses related to contracts that meet and are designated with the normal
purchase normal sale exception are recognized upon settlement. We generally apply this exception to eligible crude contracts. We do not use hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives.  
 The following table presents the gross fair values of our commodity derivatives, excluding collateral, and the line items where they appear on our
consolidated balance sheet:

    Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives   
 We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. Our foreign currency exchange derivative activity primarily relates to
managing our cash-related and foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital programs or local currency tax payments, dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates. We do not elect hedge
accounting on our foreign currency exchange derivatives.    The following table presents the gross fair values of our foreign currency exchange derivatives,
excluding collateral, and the line items where they appear on our consolidated balance sheet:

    **Primarily Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone.   
  ***Primarily Canadian dollar and euro.      Financial
Instruments     We have certain financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various currency pools we manage. The maturities
of these investments may from time to time extend beyond 90 days. The types of financial instruments include:      

Time deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with approved financial institutions.    

Money market funds: Short-term securities representing high-quality liquid debt and monetary instruments.    

Commercial paper: Unsecured promissory notes issued by a corporation, commercial bank, or government agency purchased at a discount, maturing at par.    
 These financial instruments appear in the  Cash and cash equivalents  line of our consolidated balance sheet if the maturities at the time we made
the investments were 90 days or less. At December 31, we held the following financial instruments:      
    Credit Risk     Financial
instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market
funds, government debt securities and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.    The credit risk from our OTC derivative
contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the
risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because  
      110  

Table of Contents  

these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for
receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.    Our trade receivables result
primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we
continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to
mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due us.  
 Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have
contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed
threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the New
York Mercantile Exchange.    The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a
liability position on December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was $158 million and $150 million, respectively. For these instruments, $2 million of collateral was posted as of December 31, 2015, and no collateral was posted as of
December 31, 2014. If our credit rating had been lowered one level from its  A  rating (per Standard and Poor s) on December 31, 2015, we would be required to post no additional collateral to our counterparties. If we had
been downgraded below investment grade, we would be required to post $156 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.  
   Note 15 Fair Value Measurement   
  We carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at a reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the following hierarchy:      

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.    

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.    

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.      The
classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is
inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities that are initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available.
Transfers occur at the end of the reporting period. There were no material transfers in or out of Level 1 during 2015 and 2014.     Recurring Fair Value
Measurement     Financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include commodity derivatives and certain
investments to support nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The deferred compensation investments are measured at fair value using unadjusted prices available from national securities exchanges; therefore, these assets are categorized as Level
1 in the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange. Level 2 derivative assets and
liabilities primarily represent OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices  
      111  

Table of Contents  

provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data. Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale
contracts where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available. The derived value uses industry standard methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various
commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and other relevant economic measures. The use of these inputs results in management s best estimate of fair value. Level 3 activity was not material for all periods
presented.    The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy for gross financial assets and liabilities (i.e., unadjusted where the right of setoff
exists for commodity derivatives accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis):      
   The following table summarizes those commodity derivative balances subject to the right of setoff as presented on our
consolidated balance sheet. We have elected to offset the recognized fair value amounts for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty in our financial statements when a legal right of offset exists.  
   
   At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not present any amounts gross on our consolidated balance sheet
where we had the right of setoff.

Table of Contents  

   Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurement   
 The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy by major category for assets accounted for at fair value on a non-recurring basis:  
   
    *Represents the fair value at the time of the impairment.   
   Net PP E (held for use)      Net PP E held for
use is comprised of various producing properties impaired to their individual fair values less costs to sell. The fair values were determined by internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices from futures exchanges
and pricing service companies, costs, and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.      Net PP E
(unproved property)      Net PP E unproved property is comprised of unproved leaseholds impaired to our best estimate of sales value less costs to
sell.      Equity Method Investments      Certain
equity method investments, primarily our investment in APLNG, were determined to have fair values below their carrying amounts, and the impairments were considered to be other than temporary. For additional information, see Note 7 Investments,
Loans and Long-Term Receivables.     Reported Fair Values of Financial Instruments   
 We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:  

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.    

Accounts and notes receivable (including long-term and related parties): The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value. The valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of
the current portion of fixed-rate related party loans is consistent with Loans and advances related parties.    

Loans and advances related parties: The carrying amount of floating-rate loans approximates fair value. The fair value of fixed-rate loan activity is measured using market observable data and is categorized as
Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information.    

Accounts payable (including related parties) and floating-rate debt: The carrying amount of accounts payable and floating-rate debt reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.    

Fixed-rate debt: The estimated fair value of fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data; therefore, these liabilities are categorized as Level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy.    
      113

 Cash Flows From Investing Activities  on our consolidated statement of cash flows.      Commodity derivatives    
 At December 31, 2015, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net with no obligations to return cash collateral and $1 million of rights to
reclaim cash collateral, respectively. At December 31, 2014, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of $8 million of obligations to return cash collateral and $4 million of rights to reclaim cash collateral,
respectively.

  Noncontrolling Interests     At December 31, 2015 and
2014, we had $320 million and $362 million outstanding, respectively, of equity in less-than-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest owners. For both periods, the amounts were related to the Darwin LNG and Bayu-Darwin
Pipeline operating joint ventures we control.

aircraft, computers and other facilities and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased property for the
fair market value at the end of the lease term. There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the leasing agreements with regard to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing ability. For additional information on leased assets under
capital leases, see Note 11 Debt.    At December 31, 2015, future minimum rental payments due under noncancelable leases were:

For both U.S. and international pensions, the overall expected long-term rate of return is developed from the expected future
return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.

*Includes settlement losses recognized in 2015.   
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, there were amendments to the U.S. other postretirement benefit plan. The benefit obligation decreased by $303
million for changes in the plan made to retiree medical benefits. The $303 million decrease consists of $149 million related to the discontinuation of all company premium cost-sharing contributions to the post-65 retiree medical plan after
December 31, 2025, $91 million related to updated cost sharing assumption changes for retirees, $49 million associated with excluding employees and retirees of Phillips 66 who were not enrolled in a ConocoPhillips retiree medical plan as of
July 1, 2015, and $14 million associated with new participants in the post-65 retiree medical plan after December 31, 2015 no longer being eligible for any company premium cost-sharing contributions. The $303 million decrease in the
benefit obligation resulted in a corresponding decrease in other comprehensive loss.    Included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
December 31, 2015, were the following before-tax tax amounts that are expected to be amortized into net periodic benefit cost during 2016:

For our tax-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit
obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan assets were $5,720 million, $5,314 million, and $4,759 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, and $7,584 million, $6,503 million, and $6,446 million, respectively,
at December 31, 2014.    For our unfunded nonqualified key employee supplemental pension plans, the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated
benefit obligation were $639 million and $564 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, and were $703 million and $482 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014.  
      118  

Table of Contents  

  The components of net periodic benefit cost of all defined benefit plans are presented in the following table:
     
   We recognized pension settlement losses of $204 million in 2015 and $67 million in 2013 as lump-sum benefit payments from
certain U.S. and international pension plans exceeded the sum of service and interest costs for those plans and led to recognition of settlement losses.  
 As part of the 2015 restructuring program, we concluded that actions taken during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulted in a significant reduction
of future services of active employees in the U.S. qualified pension plan, a U.S. nonqualified supplemental retirement plan, certain international qualified and nonqualified pension plans, and the U.S. other postretirement benefit plan. As a result,
we recognized an increase in the benefit obligation and a proportionate share of prior service cost from other comprehensive income (loss) as curtailment losses of $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Also as part of the 2015 restructuring program in the U.S. and Europe, we recognized expense for special termination benefits of $124 million during the year
ended December 31, 2015, consisting of $46 million in the U.S. and $78 million in Europe (including related social security tax). Approximately 62 percent of the Europe amount is recoverable from joint venture partners.  
 In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service
period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.  
 We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and subject to various cost
sharing features, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The measurement of the U.S. pre-65 retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost
trend rate of 6.75 percent in 2016 that declines to 5 percent by 2023. The measurement of the U.S. post-65 retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 3 percent in 2016 that
increases to 5 percent by 2018. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would be immaterial to ConocoPhillips.

   Plan Assets  We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes,
investment managers and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed
income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are 58 percent equity securities, 36 percent debt
securities and 6 percent real estate. Generally, the plan investments are publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.    The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2015 and 2014.  

Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 1 are primarily based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.    

Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices for
similar assets and liabilities in active markets and for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models
that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. When observable quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs
such as benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.    

Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.    

Fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.    

Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in Level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates. U.S. cash balances
held in the form of short-term fund units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as Level 2.    

Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives classified in Level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input
parameters from third-party sources.    

Private equity funds are valued at net asset value as determined by the issuer based on the fair value of the underlying assets.    

Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans  participants.    

Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.    

A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit
obligation covered by the contract. The participating interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a combination of quoted market prices, recently executed transactions, and an actuarial present
value computation for contract obligations. At December 31, 2015, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $125 million and consisted of $305 million in debt securities, less $180 million for the accumulated benefit
obligation covered by the contract. At December 31, 2014, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $116 million and consisted of $328 million in debt securities, less $212 million for the accumulated benefit obligation
covered by the contract. The net change from 2014 to 2015 is due to a decrease in the fair value of the underlying investments of $23 million and a decrease in the present value of the contract obligation of $32 million. The participating interest
is not available for meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2016, we expect to contribute approximately $220 million to our domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement
benefit plans and $190 million to our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.    The following benefit
payments, which are exclusive of amounts to be paid from the insurance annuity contract and which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:      
    Severance Accrual     As a
result of the current business environment s impact on our operating and capital plans, a reduction in our overall employee workforce occurred during 2015. Severance accruals of $306 million were recorded in 2015. The following table summarizes
our severance accrual activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:      
   Of the remaining balance at December 31, 2015, $121 million is classified as short-term.  
  Defined Contribution Plans     Most U.S. employees are
eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP). Employees can deposit up to 75 percent of their eligible pay, subject to statutory limits, in the CPSP to a choice of approximately 35 investment funds. In 2015, employees who
participate in the CPSP and contribute 1 percent of their eligible pay receive a 9 percent company cash match, subject to certain limitations. Starting in 2016, employees who participate in the CPSP and contribute 1 percent of their eligible pay
receive a 6 percent company cash match with a potential company discretionary cash contribution of up to 6 percent. Company contributions charged to expense related to continuing and discontinued operations for the CPSP and predecessor plans were
$103 million in 2015, $116 million in 2014, and $101 million in 2013.    In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company
(subsequently the stock savings feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of company common stock. Since the company guaranteed the CPSP s borrowings, the unpaid balance was reported as a
liability of the company and unearned compensation was shown as a reduction of common stockholders  equity. Dividends on all shares were charged against retained earnings. The debt was serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and
dividends received on certain shares of common stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings feature of the CPSP were released for  
      122

allocation to participant accounts based on debt service payments on CPSP borrowings. In 2012, the final debt service payment was made and all remaining unallocated shares were released for
allocation to participant accounts. The total number of allocated CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, were 7,243,832 and 8,198,873, respectively.  
 We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation
expense related to continuing and discontinued operations recognized for these international plans was approximately $55 million in 2015, $66 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2013.  
  Share-Based Compensation Plans     The 2014 Omnibus Stock
and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2014. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 79 million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees and
directors; however, as of the effective date of the Plan, (i) any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii) any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the prior plans that are
forfeited, expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the
prior plans. Of the 79 million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40 million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors
is authorized to determine the types, terms, conditions, and limitations of awards granted. Awards may be granted in the form of, but not limited to, stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units to employees and nonemployee
directors who contribute to the company s continued success and profitability.    Total share-based compensation expense is measured using the grant
date fair value for our equity-classified awards and the settlement date fair value for our liability-classified awards. We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required
to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be
subject to forfeiture. Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement. Some of
our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). We recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for
the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.     Stock Options  Stock options granted under the provisions of
the Plan and prior plans permit purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of ConocoPhillips common stock on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest
ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to certain employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but
those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period.     Compensation Expense  Total share-based compensation
expense recognized in income (loss) related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December 31 were as follows:      
 
      123

  The fair market values of the options granted over the past three years were measured on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used were as follows:      
   There were no ranges in the assumptions used to determine the fair market values of our options granted over the past three
years.    Due to the separation of our Downstream businesses in 2012, expected volatility for grants of options in 2014 and 2013 was based on a three-year
average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies. We believe our historical volatility for periods prior to the separation of our Downstream businesses is no longer relevant in estimating expected volatility. For 2015, expected
volatility was based on the weighted average blend of the company s historical stock price volatility from May 1, 2012 (the date of separation of our Downstream businesses) through the stock option grant date and the average historical
stock price volatility of a group of peer companies for the expected term of the options.    The following summarizes our stock option activity for the year
ended December 31, 2015:      
   The weighted-average remaining contractual term of outstanding options, vested options and exercisable options at
December 31, 2015, was 5.84 years, 5.27 years and 4.43 years, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock option awards granted during 2014 and 2013 was $10.17 and $9.90, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of
options exercised during 2014 and 2013 was $89 million and $95 million, respectively.    During 2015, we received $23 million in cash and realized a tax
benefit related to both continuing and discontinued operations of $16 million from the exercise of options. At December 31, 2015, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $16 million, which will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 1.22 years, the longest period being 2.13 years.

   Stock Unit Program  Generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the
Plan. Restricted stock units granted prior to 2013 generally vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of the grant date. Beginning in 2013, restricted stock units granted will vest in an aggregate
installment on the third anniversary of the grant date. In addition, beginning in 2012, restricted stock units granted under the Plan for a variable long-term incentive program vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the first
anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units vest vary by award. Upon vesting, the restricted stock units are
settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to retirement eligible employees vest six months from the grant date; however, those units are not issued as common stock until the earlier of separation from the
company or the end of the regularly scheduled vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the restricted stock units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. The grant date fair
market value of these restricted stock units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the
average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.    The following summarizes our
stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:      
   At December 31, 2015, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested units was $155 million, which
will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.53 years, the longest period being 2.67 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock unit awards granted during 2014 and 2013 was $62.72 and $57.99, respectively. The total fair
value of stock units issued during 2014 and 2013 was $256 million and $245 million, respectively.     Performance Share Program  Under the
Plan, we also annually grant restricted performance share units (PSUs) to senior management. These PSUs are authorized three years prior to their effective grant date (the performance period). Compensation expense is initially measured using the
average fair market value of ConocoPhillips common stock and is subsequently adjusted, based on changes in the ConocoPhillips stock price through the end of each subsequent reporting period, through the grant date for stock-settled awards and the
settlement date for cash-settled awards.      Stock-Settled    
 For performance periods beginning before 2009, PSUs do not vest until the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of
service, and restrictions do not lapse until the employee separates from the company. With respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009 through 2012, PSUs do not vest until the earlier of the date the employee becomes eligible for
retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or five years after the grant date of the award, and restrictions do not lapse until the earlier of the employee s separation from the company or five years after the grant date
(although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation). We recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are
authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of  
      125

authorization and ending on the date of grant. Until issued as stock, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings.
Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants will vest, absent employee election to defer, upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date
of authorization and ending on the conclusion of the performance period. PSUs are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit.  
 The following summarizes our stock-settled Performance Share Program activity for the year ended December 31, 2015:  
   
   At December 31, 2015, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested stock-settled performance share awards
was $9 million, which includes $2 million related to unvested stock-settled performance share awards tied to Phillips 66 stock held by ConocoPhillips employees, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.76 years, the longest
period being 4.99 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-settled PSUs granted during 2014 and 2013 was $65.46 and $60.00, respectively. The total fair value of stock-settled PSUs issued during both 2014 and 2013 was $18 million.
     Cash-Settled      In connection with and
immediately following the separation of our Downstream businesses in 2012, grants of new PSUs, subject to a shortened performance period, were authorized. Once granted, these PSUs vest, absent employee election to defer, on the earlier of five years
after the grant date of the award or the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement. For employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of
authorization and ending on the date of grant. Otherwise, we recognize compensation expense beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. These PSUs are settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share
of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and thus are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Until settlement occurs, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to
compensation expense.    Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants will vest upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year
performance period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the conclusion of the performance period. These PSUs will be settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of
ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet.

  The following summarizes our cash-settled Performance Share Program activity for the year ended December 31,
2015:      
   At December 31, 2015, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested cash-settled performance share awards
was $18 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.10 years, the longest period being 4.13 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of cash-settled PSUs granted during 2014 and 2013 was $69.23 and $58.08,
respectively. The total fair value of cash-settled performance share awards settled during 2014 and 2013 was zero.    From inception of the Performance
Share Program through 2013, approved PSU awards were granted after the conclusion of performance periods. Beginning in February 2014, initial target PSU awards are issued near the beginning of new performance periods. These initial target PSU awards
will terminate at the end of the performance periods and will be settled after the performance periods have ended. Also in 2014, initial target PSU awards were issued for open performance periods that began in prior years. For the open performance
period beginning in 2012, the initial target PSU awards will terminate at the end of the three-year performance period and will be replaced with approved PSU awards. For the open performance period beginning in 2013, the initial target PSU awards
will terminate at the end of the three-year performance period and will be settled after the performance period has ended. There is no effect on recognition of compensation expense.  
  Other  In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were either issued
to replace awards held by employees of companies we acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.
   The following summarizes the aggregate activity of these restricted shares and units for the year ended December 31, 2015:  
   
   At December 31, 2015, all outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units were fully vested and there was no
remaining compensation cost to be recorded. The weighted-average grant date fair value of awards granted during 2014 and 2013 was $71.23 and $62.52, respectively. The total fair value of awards issued during 2014 and 2013 was $3 million and $2
million, respectively.

Note 19 Income Taxes   
  Income taxes charged to income (loss) from continuing operations were:  
   
   Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. Major components of deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31 were:      
   Effective December 31, 2015, we early adopted, on a prospective basis, FASB ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes.  This ASU requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be reported as noncurrent. Noncurrent assets and liabilities include deferred taxes of $286 million and $10,999 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2015. Current assets, noncurrent assets, current liabilities and noncurrent  
      128  

Table of Contents  

liabilities included deferred taxes of $865 million, $370 million, $8 million and $15,070 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The adoption of this ASU was not
reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows.    We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally
expire between 2016 and 2036 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.    Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred
tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During 2015, valuation allowances decreased a total of $236 million. This decrease primarily relates to the relinquishment of certain assets. Based on our historical taxable
income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future
taxable income.    At December 31, 2015, unremitted income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign
corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $3,300 million. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this amount, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. Due to the nature of our structures
within the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the complex nature of the relevant tax laws, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be payable on this income if distributed.  
 The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits for 2015, 2014 and 2013:  
   
   Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $354 million, $348 million and $440
million, respectively, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate.    At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, accrued liabilities for
interest and penalties totaled $79 million, $65 million and $120 million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in a reduction to earnings of $11 million in 2015, and a benefit to earnings of $43
million and $9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.    We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and
state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2012), Canada (2009), United States (2010) and Norway (2014). Issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing
and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably possible such changes
could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.

  The amounts of U.S. and foreign income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, with a
reconciliation of tax at the federal statutory rate with the provision for income taxes, were:      
   The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to the U.K. tax law change and electing the fair market
value method of apportioning interest expense for prior years, discussed below; partially offset by lower income in high tax jurisdictions and the Canadian tax law change, discussed below.  
 The change in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014, was primarily due to lower income in high tax jurisdictions.  
 In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on March 26, 2015, to decrease the overall U.K. upstream corporation tax rate from 62 percent to 50
percent effective January 1, 2015. As a result, a $555 million net tax benefit for revaluing the U.K. deferred tax liability is reflected in the  Provision (benefit) for income taxes  line on our consolidated income statement.  
 In Canada, legislation was enacted on June 29, 2015, to increase the overall Canadian corporation tax rate from 25 percent to 27 percent effective
July 1, 2015. As a result, a $129 million net tax expense for revaluing the Canadian deferred tax liability is reflected in the  Provision (benefit) for income taxes  line on our consolidated income statement.  
 In December 2015, we filed refund claims for prior years electing the fair market value method of apportioning interest in the United States. As a result, a
$185 million tax benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.    Certain operating losses in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. only yield a tax
benefit in the U.S. as a worthless security deduction. For 2015, 2014 and 2013 the amount of the benefit was $491 million, $122 million and $19 million, respectively.

  We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. We manage
our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.  
 After agreeing to sell our Nigeria business in 2012, we completed the sale in the third quarter of 2014. Results for these operations have been reported as
discontinued operations in all periods presented. For additional information, see Note 3 Discontinued Operations.    Effective November 1, 2015,
the Other International and historically presented Europe segments were restructured to align with changes to our internal organization structure. The Libya business was moved from the Other International segment to the historically presented Europe
segment, which is now renamed Europe and North Africa. Accordingly, results of operations for the Other International and Europe and North Africa segments have been revised in all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial
statements, and the impact on our segment presentation is immaterial.    Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating
segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues. Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents.  
 We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. Segment accounting policies are the same as those in
Note 1 Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.

   Note 25 New Accounting Standards   
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (ASU No. 2014-09), which outlines
a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most
industry-specific guidance. This ASU sets forth a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity will be required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an
amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures will be required to describe the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts.    In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Deferral of the Effective Date,  which defers the effective date of ASU
No. 2014-09. The ASU is now effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities may choose to adopt the
standard using either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and continue to monitor proposals issued by the FASB to clarify the ASU.  
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which amends existing requirements applicable to
reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether certain legal entities should be consolidated. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may choose to
adopt the standard using either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Oil and Gas Operations  (Unaudited)  
 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932,  Extractive Activities Oil and
Gas,  and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.

 As required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on
historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved
reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.    Our proved reserves include estimated
quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under the  economic interest  method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses
and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At
December 31, 2015, approximately 6 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, located in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area, and 32 percent of our total proved reserves were under a variable-royalty regime,
located in our Canada geographic reporting area.    Our reserves disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (Norway and the
United Kingdom), Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa and Other Areas. Other Areas primarily consists of the Russia and Caspian regions, which we exited in 2015.  
 As part of our asset disposition program, we sold our interest in Kashagan, and the Algeria and Nigeria businesses. These businesses were considered held for
sale since the fourth quarter of 2012 and have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, the Results of Operations, Average Sales Prices and Net Production tables included within the supplemental oil and gas
disclosures reflect the associated earnings and production as discontinued operations.    Kashagan and Algeria were both sold in the fourth quarter of 2013.
In July 2014, we sold our Nigeria business. See Note 3 Discontinued Operations, for additional information.      Reserves Governance    
 The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB. Proved reserves are those quantities
of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating
methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for
the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence the project within a reasonable time.  
      139  

Table of Contents  

  Proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved
reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, and through installed
extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.    We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant
internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business
unit s reserve processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company s Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geologists, finance
personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business units  reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits,
teleconferences and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit
line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or
technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.  
 During 2015, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, were reviewed by D M. The purpose
of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips  technical staff
presented D M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance
calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management s intent in retaining D M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on
these processes and controls. D M s opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2015, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves
definitions. D M s report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    The technical person primarily responsible for
overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company s reserve estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master s degree in petroleum engineering. He is a member
of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 25 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the United States and several international
field locations.    Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the  Critical Accounting Estimates 
section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

Natural gas production in the reserves table may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in our statistics disclosure,
primarily because the quantities above include gas consumed in production operations.    Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch
absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.    Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2015, included:  

Revisions  : In 2015, revisions in Lower 48, Alaska and Canada were primarily due to lower prices, partially offset by positive revisions in Asia Pacific/Middle East from Indonesia. In 2014, revisions were
primarily due to higher prices, increased development activity and strong well performance in Lower 48 and higher prices and improved well performance in Canada and our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East. This was partially offset
by lower prices and higher costs in Alaska. For our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East, 2014 revisions were primarily due to strong field performance. In 2013, revisions were primarily due to higher prices in 2013 versus 2012, and
improved well performance in Lower 48 and Canada.        

Extensions and discoveries  : In 2014, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 and Canada were primarily due to continued drilling success in Eagle Ford and Bakken and ongoing development activity in western
Canada. In 2013, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily due to continued drilling success in Eagle Ford, Bakken and Barnett. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, for our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries
were due to APLNG s ongoing development drilling onshore Australia.             

Sales  : In 2015, Lower 48 sales were due to the disposition of non-core assets in South Texas, East Texas and North Louisiana and sales of assets in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta impacted
Canada. In 2014, for our consolidated operations in Africa, sales were due to the sale of the Nigeria business.

Notable changes in proved bitumen reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2015, included:  

Revisions  : In 2015, for both our consolidated operations and equity affiliates revisions were primarily related to reduced royalties from lower prices at Surmont, Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows
Lake. In 2013, for our consolidated operations revisions were primarily related to ongoing project development at Surmont and improved well performance.        

Extensions and discoveries  : In 2015, for our equity affiliates extensions and discoveries were related to approval of development at Christina Lake. In 2014, for our consolidated operations extensions and
discoveries were primarily related to delineation activity at Surmont. In 2014, for our equity affiliates extensions and discoveries were primarily related to delineation activity at Foster Creek and Christina Lake, as well as regulatory approval of

Natural gas reserves are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural
gas converts to one BOE.      Proved Undeveloped Reserves    
 We had 3,024 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2015, compared with 3,259 million BOE at year-end 2014. During 2015, we
converted 595 million BOE of undeveloped reserves to developed, primarily through ongoing development activities, as well as from the startup of major development projects. In addition, we added 360 million BOE of undeveloped reserves in
2015, mainly through extensions and discoveries from ongoing development progress. As a result, at December 31, 2015, our proved undeveloped reserves represented 37 percent of total proved reserves, which was unchanged from
December 31, 2014. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2015, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $6.8 billion. A portion of our costs incurred each year relate to development projects where the
proved undeveloped reserves will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.    Approximately 77 percent of our proved undeveloped
reserves at year-end 2015 were associated with five major development areas. Four of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved undeveloped reserves convert to proved developed over time, as development
activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include:      

The Surmont oil sands project in Canada.        

FCCL oil sands Foster Creek and Christina Lake in Canada.        

The Eagle Ford area in the Lower 48.      The remaining major development area, Narrows Lake in our FCCL oil sands
in Canada, was sanctioned for development in 2012.  
      150  

Table of Contents  

  At the end of 2015, approximately 26 percent of our total proved undeveloped reserves, located in the Athabasca
oil sands in Canada, have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The oil sands in Canada consist of the FCCL and Surmont steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects. The majority of our remaining proved undeveloped reserves in this area
were recorded beginning in 2007. Our SAGD projects are large, multi-year projects with steady, long-term production at consistent levels. The associated undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed over the life of the project, as additional
well pairs are drilled to maintain throughput at the central processing facilities.      Results of Operations    
 The company s results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013 are shown in the following tables. Non-oil and gas
activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, crude oil and gas marketing activities, and the profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are excluded. Additional
information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:      

Sales include sales to unaffiliated entities attributable primarily to the company s net working interests and royalty interests. Sales are net of fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production
function to a final delivery point using transportation operations which are not consolidated.        

Transportation costs reflect fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final delivery point using transportation operations which are consolidated.    

Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.    

Production costs include costs incurred to operate and maintain wells, related equipment and facilities used in the production of petroleum liquids and natural gas.    

Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.        

Depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.        

Other related expenses include inventory fluctuations, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous expenses.

    Development and Exploration Activities    
 The following two tables summarize our net interest in productive and dry exploratory and development wells in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
and 2013. A  development well  is a well drilled within the proved area of a reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. An  exploratory well  is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or
natural gas in an unknown field or a new reservoir within a proven field. Excluded from the exploratory well count are stratigraphic-type exploratory wells, primarily relating to oil sands delineation wells located in Canada and coalbed methane test
wells located in Asia Pacific/Middle East.      

(2)  
  This also includes net extension wells of 22, 49 and 55 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Extension wells are wells drilled in areas near or offsetting current production, or in
areas where well density or production history have not achieved statistical certainty of results, primarily located in Asia Pacific/Middle East and the United States.

    Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities
     In accordance with SEC and FASB requirements, amounts were computed using 12-month average prices (adjusted only for existing contractual terms)
and end-of-year costs, appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor. Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the
12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of  year-end  economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised
over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves and the timing and
amount of future development costs, including dismantlement, and future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.    While due care was
taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

   Sources of Change in Discounted Future Net Cash Flows      

The net change in prices and production costs is the beginning-of-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual change in the per-unit sales price and production cost, discounted at 10 percent.

Purchases and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions, discoveries and improved recovery, are calculated using production forecasts of the applicable reserve quantities for the year multiplied by the  12-month  average sales prices, less future estimated costs, discounted at 10 percent.        

Revisions of previous quantity estimates are calculated using production forecast changes for the year, including changes in the timing of production, multiplied by the  12-month 
average sales prices, less future estimated costs, discounted at 10 percent.        

The accretion of discount is 10 percent of the prior year s discounted future cash inflows, less future production and development costs.    

The net change in income taxes is the annual change in the discounted future income tax provisions.

 We have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, with respect to publicly held debt
securities. ConocoPhillips Company is 100 percent owned by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I are indirect, 100 percent owned subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoPhillips
and ConocoPhillips Company have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, with respect to their publicly held debt securities. Similarly,
ConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities. In addition, ConocoPhillips Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment
obligations of ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly held debt securities. All guarantees are joint and several. The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the results of operations, financial position and cash flows
for:      

ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I (in each case, reflecting investments in subsidiaries utilizing the equity method of accounting).    

All other nonguarantor subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.    

The consolidating adjustments necessary to present ConocoPhillips  results on a consolidated basis.      In
May 2014, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which ConocoPhillips, as a well-known seasoned issuer, has the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities, with
certain debt securities guaranteed by ConocoPhillips Company. Also as part of that registration statement, ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have the ability to issue and sell preferred trust securities, guaranteed by
ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have not issued any trust-preferred securities under this registration statement, and thus have no assets or liabilities. Accordingly, columns for these two trusts are not included
in the condensed consolidating financial information.    During 2013, ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company s guaranteed, publicly held debt was
repaid. Beginning in 2014, financial information for ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company is presented in the  All Other Subsidiaries  column of our condensed consolidating financial information.  
 In 2014, ConocoPhillips received $34.5 billion in dividends from ConocoPhillips Company to settle certain accumulated intercompany balances. This
consisted of a $17.5 billion distribution of earnings and a $17 billion return of capital. These transactions had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In 2015, ConocoPhillips received a $3.5 billion return of capital from ConocoPhillips Company to settle certain accumulated intercompany balances. The
transaction had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, ConocoPhillips received a $2.3 billion return of capital from
ConocoPhillips Company to settle certain accumulated intercompany balances. The transaction will be reflected in the first quarter 2016 Condensed Consolidating Financial Information for ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company and is expected
to have no impact on our consolidated financial statements.    This condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.

Exhibit 10.10.2  
  FIRST AMENDMENT TO   
  CONOCOPHILLIPS      KEY
EMPLOYEE SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN     On April 19, 2012, effective as of the  Effective Time  defined
in the Employee Matters Agreement by and between ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 (the  Effective Time ), ConocoPhillips Company (the  Company ) amended and restated the Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan ( KESRP )
for the benefit of certain employees of the Company and its affiliates.    The Company desires to amend the KESRP by
amending certain provisions as set forth below and adding Schedules B and C, effective September 1, 2015.    Pursuant
to the foregoing, the KESRP is hereby amended as follows, effective September 1, 2015:      

1. 
   After Subsection (k) of Section I, add the following new Subsection (l), renumbering the existing subsequent Subsections thereafter
accordingly:        (l)  MSBP  shall mean the Burlington Resources Inc. Management
Supplemental Benefits Plan (or any successor plan thereto).       

2. 
   After Subsection (u) of Section I (as renumbered, previously Subsection (t)), add the following new Subsection (v) renumbering the
existing subsequent Subsections thereafter accordingly:        (v)  Schedule B Employee  shall
mean an Employee whose name appears in Schedule B attached to and made a part of this Plan.       

3. 
   After new Subsection (v) of Section I, add the following new Subsection (w), renumbering the existing subsequent Subsections thereafter
accordingly:        (w)  Schedule C Employee  shall mean an Employee whose name appears in
Schedule C attached to and made a part of this Plan.       

4. 
   After Subsection (b)(i)(gg) of Section II, add the following new Subsection (b)(i)(hh):     
  (hh) With regard to a Schedule B Employee, determine service credited for purposes of benefit accrual as if time served
while on a Canada payroll were time served on a United States payroll; provided, however, that, if benefit accrual is at any time frozen under Title I, no further service shall be credited from the time such freeze shall become effective.   

5. 
   After Subsection (e)(v) of Section II, add the following new Subsection (e)(vi):     
  (vi) With regard to a Schedule B Employee, determine service credited for purposes of benefit accrual as if time served
while on a Canada payroll were time served on a United States  
      1  

payroll; provided, however, that, if benefit accrual is at any time frozen under Title IV, no further service shall be credited from the time such freeze shall become effective.   

6. 
   Section IV shall be replaced in its entirety to read as follows:     
  SECTION IV.  Special Provisions for Certain Heritage Employees   

(a) 
   Special Provision for Former ARCO Alaska Employees.         

Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, in order to comply with the terms of the Board approved Master Purchase and Sale Agreement
( Sale Agreement ) by which the Company acquired certain Alaskan assets of Atlantic Richfield Company, Inc. ( ARCO ), the following supplemental payments will be made:     

(i) 
   The payments which would have been received under Article XXIV   ARCO Flight Crew of Title I of the Retirement Plan for those who were
classified as an Aviation Manager, Chief Pilot, Assistant Chief Pilot, Captain or Reserve Captain as of July 31, 2000 if they had been eligible for those benefits under Title I of the Retirement Plan, except that if they receive a limited
social security makeup benefit from Title I of the Retirement Plan it will be offset from the benefit payable from the Plan.     

(ii) 
   A final ARCO Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) benefit will be calculated at the earlier of the time an Employee who had an ARCO SERP
benefit terminates employment or, 2 years following the ARCO/BP Amoco p.l.c. merger, April 17, 2002 ( calculation date ). The SERP benefit attributable to service through July 31, 2000 shall be paid by BP Amoco p.l.c. and the
difference shall be paid by this Plan. The SERP calculation will be done as if the Employee had continued to participate in the Atlantic Richfield Retirement Plan and SERP up to the calculation date. The ARCO Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) amount used
will be:     

(A) 
   If the Employee terminates employment involuntarily prior to April 17, 2002, the highest of the actual AIP in the last 3 years including the
AIP target payment amount for years after 1999 or the payment received under Phillips Annual Incentive Compensation Plan.     

(B) 
   If the Employee terminates employment voluntarily prior to April 17, 2002, or if the calculation is made as of April 17, 2002, then the
AIP will include the highest 3 year average using the highest of the actual AIP, the AIP target payment amount for years after 1999, or the payment received under Phillips Annual Incentive Compensation Plan. Any benefit paid by this Plan under this
Section IV(b)(ii) and the SERP benefit paid by BP Amoco p.l.c. shall offset the benefit payable from this Plan.         

(b) 
   Special Provision for Select Heritage Burlington Resources Employees in Canada.     

With regard to the employees listed on Schedule C, the following shall apply:     

(i) 
   The Schedule C Employee will become a Participant in the Plan, solely for the purpose of providing a further benefit (the  Additional
Benefit ), calculated in accordance with the provisions of this subsection IV(b). Payment of the Additional Benefit shall be made at the same time and in the same form as the     
      2  

benefits paid, or payable, under the MSBP with regard to Non-Grandfathered Benefits, as that term is used in the MSBP.     

(ii) 
   Additional Benefit shall mean the difference between the Putative MSBP Benefit and the Offsetting Benefits, both as described below. The Putative
MSBP Benefit shall mean the difference between the Schedule C Employee s total accrued benefit under Title VI of the CPRP and his actual accrued benefit under Title VI. For this purpose, a Schedule C Employee s  total accrued benefit
under Title VI  is the accrued benefit he would have if his accrued benefit under Title VI were determined under the terms of Title VI but with the following modifications:     

(A) 
   Include in Annual Earnings any compensation included under the MSBP, including it in the calendar year to which it would have been credited under
the MSBP.     

(B) 
   Disregard the limitations on compensation related to Code section 401(a)(17).     

(C) 
   Disregard the limitation on benefits related to Code section 415.     

(D) 
   Determine service credited for purposes of benefit accrual by taking into account any service granted to the Schedule C Employee and any benefit
formula adjustments required by an employment contract with the Employer; provided, further, that with regard to a Schedule C Employee, determine service credited for purposes of benefit accrual as if time served while on a Canada payroll were time
served on a United States payroll; provided, however, that, if benefit accrual is at any time frozen under Title VI, no further service shall be credited from the time such freeze shall become effective.     

Furthermore, in determining the Additional Benefit, paragraphs (f) and (g) of Section II of the Plan shall apply; provided, that, such
paragraph (f) shall be construed as if the Title VI related benefit described in this paragraph were among the CPRP Titles listed in such paragraph (f).     

(iii) 
   The Offsetting Benefits shall mean any benefit, other than the Additional Benefit, provided to the Schedule C Employee under a defined benefit plan
of ConocoPhillips, including but not limited to the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan (and any successor plan), the ConocoPhillips Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (and any successor plan), and the Burlington Resources Inc. Management
Supplemental Benefits Plan (and any successor plan); provided, however, that a benefit plan shall not be considered unless it is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and is a  defined benefit
plan  (as defined in section 3(35) of ERISA), including any such plan regardless of whether it might also be considered an  excess benefit plan  as defined in section 3(36) of ERISA.     

(iv) 
   Nothing in this subsection IV(b) is intended to affect the other operations or provisions of the Plan. If the Schedule C Employee is, under the
provisions of the Plan, otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan, the Schedule C Employee will do so in accordance with those provisions.

  SECOND AMENDMENT TO   
  TITLE II OF THE      DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION MAKE-UP PLAN      OF CONOCOPHILLIPS   
  (2012 RESTATEMENT)   
   Effective as of the  Effective Time  defined in the Employee Matters Agreement by and between
ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 (the  Effective Time ), ConocoPhillips Company (the  Company ) amended and restated the Defined Contribution Make-Up Plan ( DCMP ) for the benefit of certain employees of the Company and
its affiliates. Effective January 1, 2013, the Company further amended the DCMP through the First Amendment to Title II of the Defined Contribution Make-Up Plan of ConocoPhillips (2012 Restatement).  
   The Company desires to amend the DCMP by the revisions set forth below, effective January 1, 2016:  
 1.   Section 1 is hereby amended to add the following provisions to the end thereof:  
  (ll)             Employer Discretionary Account   shall have the same
meaning as set forth in the CPSP.    (mm)           Employer Discretionary Contribution
Account   shall have the same meaning as set forth in the CPSP.    (nn)
            Employer Matching Account   shall have the same meaning as set forth in the CPSP.  
 (oo)             Employer Matching Contribution Account   shall have the same
meaning as set forth in the CPSP.     2.   Section 4 is amended to read as follows:  
  For any period in which a Highly Compensated Employee s DCMP Pay exceeds his or her CPSP Pay, a Benefit amount shall be credited to
a Highly Compensated Employee s Supplemental Thrift Feature Account for the Ongoing Plan no later than the end of the month following the Valuation Date that Company contributions are made either to the Highly Compensated Employee s
Employer Matching Contribution Account or to the Highly Compensated Employee s Employer Discretionary Contribution Account, or would have been made to either such account if the Highly Compensated Employee had received Company contributions
under the CPSP. The Benefit amount so credited shall equal the percentage set by the CPSP with regard to an Employer Matching Contribution or by the Company with regard to an Employer Discretionary Contribution, as the case may be, multiplied by the
amount by which the Highly Compensated Employee s DCMP Pay for the period for  

which the Employer Matching Contribution or the Employer Discretionary Contribution, as the case may be, exceeds his or her CPSP Pay for that period.

the event of the Company s Insolvency,     

as herein defined, until paid to Participants and their Beneficiaries in such manner and at such times as specified in the Arrangements and in this Trust Agreement;     

(j) 
   WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that this Trust shall constitute an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the

1.         Establishment of The Trust        

(a) 
   The Trust is intended to be a Grantor Trust, of which the Company is the Grantor, within the meaning of subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1,
subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be construed accordingly.

   The Company hereby agrees that the assets held in the Trust by Chase for the Arrangements shall be transferred to the Trustee in the Trust and
shall become the principal of the Trust to be held, administered and disposed of by the Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement.         

(e) 
   The principal of the Trust, and any earnings thereon shall be held separate and apart from other funds of the Company and shall be used exclusively
for the uses and purposes of Participants and general creditors as herein set forth. Participants and their Beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust. Any rights
created under the Arrangements and this Trust Agreement shall be unsecured contractual rights of Participants and their Beneficiaries against the Company. Any assets held by the Trust will be subject to the claims of the general creditors of
the Company under federal and state law in the event the Company is Insolvent, as defined in Section 3(a) herein.         

(f) 
   On before September 15 of each year (the  Funding Date ), the Company shall make an irrevocable contribution to the Trust in an amount
determined by the Company, provided, however, that such contribution must be sufficient, when aggregated with the other assets of the Trust, to cause the value of the Trust Fund following such contribution to be no less than
    
      Page 2  

the amount required to fully fund one-hundred percent (100 %), of the amount necessary to fund all benefits to which Participants and their Beneficiaries are entitled pursuant to the terms of the
Arrangements (the  Required Funding Amount ), but no more than one-hundred and twenty percent (120%) of such amount as determined by the Trustee. The Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall make the determination of the Required Funding
Amount, and in making this determination the Trustee shall determine the amount of defined benefit obligations under the Arrangements as of January 1 of the prior calendar year, and as to all defined contribution and deferred compensation
obligations, the amount shall be determined as of the end of the month immediately preceding the Funding Date Such contributed amounts to be held, administered and disposed of by the Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement. At any time during
the calendar year that the Company supplies the Trustee with updated benefit data the Trustee shall determine whether additional contributions are required to fully satisfy all Company benefit obligations under the Arrangements in respect of such
updated information. In making the determinations of required Company contributions in this paragraph (f) prior to a Change of Control, the Trustee shall rely on the determinations of the Company or any third parties engaged by the Company to make
such funding determinations, subject to the following:         

(1) 
   for individual deferred compensation account balances and defined contribution obligations, the third party recordkeeper s data shall be
presumed correct unless demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence to be in error;         

(2) 
   for defined benefit obligations, the actuarial assumptions used by such third party to calculate the funding required shall be the same as those
used the actuary for the Retirement Income Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (the  RIP Assumptions ) to determine the funding required under ERISA for such plan, and if the third party uses different actuarial assumptions, then the
Trustee shall engage an actuary to determine such amounts using the RIP Assumptions; provided, however that if in the Trustee s sole and absolute discretion, it determines that the RIP Assumptions are unreasonable in any manner for the proper
determination of such funding obligations, then the Trustee may, upon written notice to the Company, have such funding amount determined by an actuary of its own choosing using actuarial assumptions determined by the Trustee, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to be reasonable; and         

(3) 
   for any additional funding required by a determination of the Trustee of additional benefits due to a Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to an
appeal to the Trustee under Section 2(a) of this Trust Agreement, the Trustee s determination of any required additional funding shall control.     
 The Company shall contribute (or cause to be contributed) to the Trust such Required Funding Amount contributions as
determined by the Trustee on or before the later of the Funding Date or the date which is thirty (30) days following receipt of written request for such amount by the Trustee.  
      Page 3  

(g) 
   Upon a Change of Control, the Company shall, as soon as possible, but in no event longer than thirty (30) days following the occurrence of a Change
of Control, as defined herein, make an irrevocable contribution to the Trust in an amount that is sufficient to fund the Trust in an amount equal to no less than one-hundred percent (100 %) but no more than one-hundred and twenty (120%) of the
Required Funding Amount, together with the amount of the Expense Account as established by the Trustee pursuant to Section 1(h). The determination of such Required Funding Amount and the Expense Account to be contributed after a Change of Control
shall be determined by the Trustee in the same manner as the determination of such amount required under paragraph (f) of this Section 1, and such amounts shall be communicated to the Company by the Trustee in writing.     

(h) 
   The Trustee may from time to time earmark funds in the Fund to be held in an Expense Account and used to pay the Trustee s fees and Trust
expenses, provided that the aggregate of all amounts credited to the Expense Account prior to a Change of Control shall not be more than $250,000, and after a Change of Control shall not be less than $250,000 nor more than two percent (2%) of the
value of the Fund. To the extent that there is a balance in the Expense Account, the Trustee shall utilize such Expense Account for payment of its fees and expenses, and in the absence of such a balance, the Trustee shall seek payment from the
Company. In the event that the Company shall fail or refuse to make such payment within sixty (60) days of demand, the Trustee may satisfy such obligations out of the assets of the Trust. If after a Change of Control the Trustee satisfies
obligations out of the assets of the Trust, the Company shall immediately upon demand by the Trustee deposit into the Trust Fund a sum equal to the amount demanded by the Trustee to reimburse the Fund for such expenses. If such funds are not
deposited with sixty (60) days of such demand, the Trustee may, in its discretion, commence legal action against the Company for recovery of the amount paid out of the Trust and demanded by the Trustee.     

(i) 
   In its discretion, the Trustee may institute an action to collect a contribution due the Trust following a Change of Control or in the event that
the Trust should ever experience a short-fall in the amount of assets necessary to make payments pursuant to the terms of the Arrangements, or if the Company should ever fail to contribute the amounts requested by the Trustee pursuant to Sections
1(f) or 1(g).        Section 2.          Payments to Participants and Their Beneficiaries 

(a) 
   Prior to a Change of Control, distributions from the Trust shall be made by the Trustee to Participants and Beneficiaries at the direction of the
Company except as may otherwise be provided by this Trust. The entitlement of a Participant or his or her Beneficiaries to benefits under the Arrangements shall be determined by the Company or such party or professional administrator as it shall
designate under the Arrangements as the Company s agent, and any claim for such benefits shall be considered and reviewed under the procedures set out in the Arrangements except as may otherwise be provided by this Trust.     

      Page 4  

(b) 
   Notwithstanding Section 2(a), a Participant or Beneficiary who believes that he is entitled to a distribution pursuant to one or more of the
Arrangements may make application to the Trustee for an independent determination by the Trustee concerning his entitlement after he has exhausted his administrative remedies under the Arrangement at issue. In making its independent determination,
the Trustee may consider information provided it by the Participant or Beneficiary or the Company. The Trustee shall, in such case, reach its own independent determination as to the Participant s or Beneficiary s entitlement to such
benefits under the Arrangement, even if the Trustee has been informed by the Company that the individual is not entitled to the benefit. Such determination shall be made within sixty (60) days of the Trustee s receipt of the Participant s
or Beneficiary s application for determination. If the Trustee so desires, it may, in its sole discretion, make additional inquiries and take such additional measures as it deems necessary in order to enable it to determine whether such
benefits claimed are due and payable, including but not limited to, interviewing or requesting affidavits from appropriate persons. The Trustee may engage an actuary, independent of the Company, to assist it in determining whether benefits are due
and payable. In addition, the Trustee may engage its own counsel or other experts it deems necessary. The cost of such actuary, counsel, and other expert, and any other costs reasonably incurred by the Trustee in making its determination shall be
borne by the Company. If the Company fails to pay any such costs when due, the Trustee may use the assets of the Trust to pay them as provided in Section 1(h). The determination of the Trustee shall be final and binding on all parties. Upon
determining that an individual is entitled to receive payment of a benefit, the Trustee shall notify such individual and the Company of the amount payable and the data upon which such determination is based. The Company waives any right to contest
any amount paid over by the Trustee hereunder pursuant to a good faith determination made by the Trustee notwithstanding any claim by or on behalf of the Company (absent a manifest abuse of discretion by the Trustee) that such payments should not be
made.         

(c) 
   The Company may make payment of benefits directly to Participants or their Beneficiaries as they become due under the terms of the
Arrangements. The Company shall notify the Trustee of its decision to make payment of benefits directly prior to the time amounts are payable to Participants or their Beneficiaries. The Trustee may reimburse the Company for such payments
upon presentation of proof satisfactory to the Trustee, in its discretion, that such payments have in fact been made. In the event the Company makes such payments directly, the Company may request the Trustee within thirty (30) days of the
making of the payment to reimburse the Company for such payment from the Trust, and upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee that such payment has been made, the Trustee shall pay such reimbursement to the Company. In addition, if
the principal of the Trust, and any earnings thereon, are not sufficient to make payments of benefits in accordance with the terms of the Arrangements, the Company shall make the balance of each such payment as it falls due in accordance with the
Arrangements. The Trustee shall notify the Company where principal and earnings are not sufficient. Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve the Company of its liabilities to pay benefits due under the Arrangements except to the extent such
liabilities are met by application of assets of the Trust.     
      Page 5  

(d) 
   The Company shall provide the Trustee with a copy of each Arrangement and shall provide the Trustee with a copy of any amendment to any Arrangement
within thirty (30) days of the adoption of the amendment. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the terms of each Arrangement as in effect prior to its amendment until the Trustee receives a copy of such amendment.     

(e) 
   On or before each Funding Date, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a schedule of benefits due under the Arrangements. Such information shall,
for defined benefit obligations, consist of information of the same type as is furnished by the Company to the actuary for its tax qualified defined benefit plan for those Participants actively employed, recognizing that individual benefit amounts
cannot be finalized until commencement of benefits and application of certain federal tax limitations to the Participant s qualified plan benefits. Such information for individual deferred compensation account balances and defined contribution
obligations shall consist of such information as determined by the third party recordkeeper. The Company agrees to cooperate at all times with the Trustee to furnish updated data as is necessary to determine final benefits due to each Participant
and Beneficiary. Subsequent to a Change of Control, the Trustee shall pay benefits due in accordance with such schedule. After a Change of Control, the Company shall continue to make the determination of benefits due to Participants or their
Beneficiaries and shall provide the Trustee with an updated schedule of benefits due; provided however, a Participant or their Beneficiaries may make application to the Trustee for an independent decision as to the amount or form of their benefits
due under the Arrangements as provided by Section 2(b).         

(f) 
   The Trustee agrees that it will not itself institute any action at law or at equity, whether in the nature of an accounting, interpleading action,
request for a declaratory judgment or otherwise, requesting a court or administrative or quasi-judicial body to make the determination required to be made by the Trustee under this Section 2 in the place and stead of the Trustee.
       Section 3.          Trustee Responsibility Regarding Payments To The Trust
Beneficiary When        The Company Is Insolvent    

(a) 
   The Trustee shall cease payment of benefits to Participants and their Beneficiaries if the Company is Insolvent. The Company shall be
considered  Insolvent  for purposes of this Trust Agreement if (i) the Company is unable to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii) the Company is subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

(b) 
   At all times during the continuance of this Trust, the principal and income of the Trust shall be subject to claims of general creditors of the
Company under federal and state law as set forth below.     
      Page 6  

(1) 
   The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall have the duty to inform the Trustee in writing that the Company is
Insolvent. If a person claiming to be a creditor of the Company alleges in writing to the Trustee that the Company has become Insolvent, the Trustee shall determine whether the Company is Insolvent and, pending such determination, the Trustee
shall discontinue payment of benefits to Participants or their Beneficiaries.         

(2) 
   Unless the Trustee has actual knowledge that the Company is Insolvent, or has received notice from the Company or a person claiming to be a
creditor alleging that the Company is Insolvent, the Trustee shall have no duty to inquire whether the Company is Insolvent. The Trustee may in all events rely on such evidence concerning the Company s solvency as may be furnished to the
Trustee and that provides the Trustee with a reasonable basis for making a determination concerning the Company s solvency.         

(3) 
   If at any time the Trustee has determined that the Company is Insolvent, the Trustee shall discontinue payments to Participants or their
Beneficiaries and shall hold the assets of the Trust for the benefit of the Company s general creditors. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall in any way diminish any rights of Participants or their Beneficiaries to pursue their rights as
general creditors of the Company with respect to benefits due under the Arrangements or otherwise.         

(4) 
   The Trustee shall resume the payment of benefits to Participants or their Beneficiaries in accordance with Section 2 of this Trust Agreement only
after the Trustee has determined that the Company is not Insolvent (or is no longer Insolvent).         

(c) 
   Provided that there are sufficient assets, if the Trustee discontinues the payment of benefits from the Trust pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof and
subsequently resumes such payments, the first payment following such discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all payments due to Participants or their Beneficiaries under the terms of the Arrangements for the period of such
discontinuance, less the aggregate amount of any payments made to Participants or their Beneficiaries by the Company in lieu of the payments provided for hereunder during any such period of discontinuance.     
  Section 4.          Payments When a Short-Fall of The Trust Assets Occurs    

(a) 
   If there are not sufficient assets for the payment of benefits pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3(c) hereof and the Company does not otherwise make
such payments within a reasonable time after demand from the Trustee, the Trustee shall make payment of benefits from the Trust to the Participants or their Beneficiaries as payments become due to those individuals. If at any time the assets of
the Trust are insufficient to pay all Participants and Beneficiaries     
      Page 7  

to whom a payment is then owed, such payments shall be reduced pro rata based on the amounts then due and payable.     

(b) 
   Upon receipt of a contribution from the Company necessary to make up for a shortfall in the payments due, the Trustee shall resume payments to all
the Participants and Beneficiaries under the Arrangements. The Trustee shall have the right to compel a contribution to the Trust from the Company to make-up for any shortfall at any time.     
  Section 5.         Payments to the Company    

(a) 
   Except as provided in Sections 2(c), 3, 5(b) and 8(a), the Company shall have no right or power to direct the Trustee to return to the Company or
to divert to others any of the Trust assets before all payment of benefits have been made to Participants and their Beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of the Arrangements.     

(b) 
   If this Trust is determined to not constitute: (i) a grantor trust as set forth in paragraph (g) of the Recitals, or (ii) an unfunded arrangement
under ERISA as set forth in paragraph (j) of the Recitals, by a federal court and appeals from that holding are no longer timely or have been exhausted, this Trust shall terminate. The Board of Directors of the Company may also terminate this Trust
if it determines, based upon an opinion of legal counsel which is satisfactory to the Trustee, that either (i) judicial authority or the opinion of the U.S. Department of Labor, Treasury Department or Internal Revenue Service (as expressed in
proposed or final regulations, advisory opinions or rulings, or similar administrative announcements) creates a significant risk that the Trust will be funding for a pension benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA ( ERISA Funding ) or the
Internal Revenue Code ( Tax Funding ), or (ii) ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code requires the Trust to be amended in a way that creates a significant risk that the Trust will be held to be ERISA Funding or Tax Funding, and failure to so
amend the Trust could subject the Company to significant penalties. Upon any such termination, the assets of the terminated Trust remaining after payment of the Trustee s fees and expenses shall be distributed, in accordance with the written
directions of the Company, as follows:         

(1) 
   Prior to a Change of Control, such assets of the Trust shall be transferred to a new trust established by the Company which is not deemed to be
ERISA Funding or Tax Funding, but which is substantially similar in all other respects to this Trust, as determined by the Trustee in its sole discretion, if the Company determines that it is possible to establish such a trust;

(2) 
   Following a Change of Control or if the Company determines that it is not possible or practical to establish the trust pursuant to (I) above, then
upon the written consent of a seventy-five percent (75%) majority of the Participants and Beneficiaries, the assets of the Trust may be distributed to the Company; or     
      Page 8  

(3) 
   If the Company determines that it is not possible or practical to esta1 iish the trust pursuant to (1) above and the Company either (i) fails
to receive the consent of a seventy-five percent (75%) majority of the Participants and Beneficiaries within thirty (30) days of such termination, or (ii) upon the direction of the Company, then the assets shall be distributed to Participants and
Beneficiaries, as the case may be, pro rata based on the then present value of the benefits to which they would have otherwise been entitled; provided, however that in the event any portion of the Trust Fund has been identified with a particular
Arrangement, the portion of the Fund so identified with that Arrangement shall be first so distributed to provide benefits of that Arrangement, and the excess, if any, shall be so distributed pro rata to the extent necessary to provide benefits of
other Arrangements. If a surplus remains in the Trust after such distributions, it shall be returned to the Company.     
  Section 6.         Investment Authority    

(a) 
   The Trustee shall not be liable in discharging its duties hereunder, including without limitation its duty to invest and reinvest the Fund, if it
acts for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries, in good faith and as a prudent person would act in accomplishing a similar task and in accordance with the terms of this Trust Agreement and any applicable federal or state
laws, rules or regulations.         

(b) 
   Subject to investment guidelines agreed to in writing from time to time by the Company and the Trustee prior to a Change of Control, the Trustee
shall have the power in investing and reinvesting the Fund in its sole discretion:

of investment companies and mutual funds, without being limited to the classes or property in which the Trustees are authorized to invest by any law or any rule of court of any state and without regard to the proportion any such property may bear to
the entire amount of the Fund;

with the Trustee for the purpose of safeguarding deferred compensation or retirement income benefits of its employees;

part of the expenses and compensation thereof any assessments levied with respect to any such property to deposit;         

(7) 
   To extend the time of payment of any obligation held by it;     

(8) 
   To hold uninvested any moneys received by it, without liability for interest thereon, but only in anticipation of payments due for investments,

(9) 
   To exercise all voting or other rights with respect to any property held by it and to grant proxies, discretionary or otherwise, which shall be at
the direction of the Financial Administrator prior to a Change of Control;         

(10) 
   For the purposes of the Trust, to borrow money from others, to issue its promissory note or notes therefor, and to secure the repayment thereof by
pledging any property held by it;         

(11) 
   To employ suitable contractors and counsel, who may be counsel to the Company or to the Trustee, and to pay their reasonable expenses and
compensation from the Fund to the extent not paid by the Company;         

(12) 
   To register investments in its own name or in the name of a nominee; to hold any investment in bearer form; and to combine certificates
representing securities with certificates of the same issue held by it in other fiduciary capacities or to deposit or to arrange for the deposit of such securities with any depository, even though, when so deposited, such securities may be held in
the name of the nominee of such depository with other securities deposited therewith by other persons, or to deposit or to arrange for the deposit of any securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government, or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, including securities evidenced by book entries rather than by certificates, with the United States Department of the Treasury or a Federal Reserve Bank, even though, when
    
      Page 10  

so deposited, such securities may not be held separate from securities deposited therein by other persons; provided, however, that no securities held in the Fund shall be deposited with the
United States Department of the Treasury or a Federal Reserve Bank or other depository in the same account as any individual property of the Trustee, and provided, further, that the books and records of the Trustee shall at all times show that all
such securities are part of the Trust Fund;         

(13) 
   To settle, compromise or submit to arbitration any claims, debts or damages due or owing to or from the Trust, respectively, to commence or defend
suits or legal proceedings to protect any interest of the Trust, and to represent the Trust in all suits or legal proceedings in any court or before any other body or tribunal; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be required to take any
such action unless it shall have been indemnified by the Company to its reasonable satisfaction against liability or expenses it might incur therefrom;         

(14) 
   To hold and retain policies of life insurance or interests therein, annuity contracts, and other property of any kind which policies are
contributed to the Trust by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or are purchased by the Trustee;         

(15) 
   To hold any other class of assets which may be contributed by the Company and that is deemed reasonable by the Trustee, unless expressly prohibited
herein;         

(16) 
   Generally, to do all acts, whether or not expressly authorized, that the Trustee may deem necessary or desirable for the protection of the Fund.

(c) 
   Prior to a Change of Control, the Company shall have the right, subject to this Section to direct the Trustee with respect to investments,
including the right to identify portions of the funds in Trust to particular Arrangements.         

(1) 
   The Company may at any time direct the Trustee to segregate all or a portion of the Fund in a separate investment account or accounts and may
appoint one or more investment managers and/or an investment committee established by the Company to direct the investment and reinvestment of each such investment account or accounts. In such event, the Company shall notify the Trustee of the
appointment of each such investment manager and/or investment committee. No such investment manager shall be related, directly or indirectly, to the Company, but members of the investment committee may be employees of the Company.

(2) 
   Thereafter, the Trustee shall make every sale or investment with respect to such investment account as directed in writing by the investment
manager or investment committee. It shall be the duty of the Trustee to act strictly in accordance with each direction. The Trustee shall be under no duty to question any such direction of the investment manager or investment committee, to
review any securities or other property held in such investment account or accounts     
      Page 11  

acquired by it pursuant to such directions or to make any recommendations to the investment managers or investment committee with respect to such securities or other property.

(3) 
   Prior to a Change of Control, the Company may particularly identify a portion of the Trust Fund with a particular Arrangement, and the portion thus
identified shall prior to a Change of Control be invested as instructed by the Company and shall be restricted in application to provide benefits or to reimburse the Company pursuant to Section 2(c) for benefits paid under such Arrangement as to
which the particularly identified portion has been identified.         

(4) 
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee, without obtaining prior approval or direction from an investment manager or investment committee, shall
invest cash balances held by it from time to time in short term cash equivalents including, but not limited to, through the medium of any short term mutual fund established and maintained by the Trustee subject to the instrument establishing such
trust fund, U.S. Treasury Bills, commercial paper (including such forms of commercial paper as may be available through the Trustee s Trust Department), certificates of deposit (including certificates issued by the Trustee in its separate
corporate capacity), and similar type securities, with a maturity not to exceed one year; and, furthermore, sell such short term investments as may be necessary to carry out the instructions of an investment manager or investment committee regarding
more permanent type investment and directed distributions.         

(5) 
   The Trustee shall neither be liable nor responsible for any loss resulting to the Fund by reason of any sale or purchase of an investment directed
by an investment manager or investment committee nor by reason of the failure to take any action with respect to any investment which was acquired pursuant to any such direction in the absence of further directions of such investment manager or
investment committee.         

(6) 
   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Trustee shall be indemnified and saved harmless by the Company from and against any
and all personal liability to which the Trustee may be subjected by carrying out any directions of an investment manager or investment committee issued pursuant hereto or for failure to act in the absence of directions of the investment manager or
investment committee including all expenses reasonably incurred in its defense in the event the Company fails to provide such defense; provided, however, the Trustee shall not be so indemnified if it participates knowingly in, or knowingly
undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of an investment manager or investment committee, having actual knowledge that such act or omission is a breach of a fiduciary duty; provided further, however, that the Trustee shall not be deemed to have
knowingly participated in or knowingly undertaken to conceal an act or omission of an investment manager or investment committee with knowledge that     
      Page 12  

such act or omission was a breach of fiduciary duty by merely complying with directions of an investment manager or investment committee or for failure to act in the absence of directions of an
investment manager or investment committee. The Trustee may rely upon any order, certificate, notice, direction or other documentary confirmation purporting to have been issued by the investment manager or investment committee which the Trustee
believes to be genuine and to have been issued by the investment manager or investment committee. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the termination of the appointment of any investment manager or investment committee until it
receives written notice thereof from the Company.         

(d) 
   Following a Change of Control, the Trustee shall have the sole and absolute discretion in the management of the Trust assets and shall have all the
powers set forth under Section 6(b). In investing the Trust assets, the Trustee shall consider:         

(1) 
   the needs of the Arrangements;         

(2) 
   the need for matching of the Trust assets with the liabilities of the Arrangements; and     

(3) 
   the duty of the Trustee to act solely in the best interests of the Participants and their Beneficiaries.     

(e) 
   The Trustee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to delegate its investment responsibility to an investment manager who may be an
affiliate of the Trustee. In the event the Trustee shall exercise this right, the Trustee shall remain, at all times responsible for the acts of an investment manager.     

(f) 
   The Company shall have the right at any time, and from time to time in its sole discretion, to substitute assets of equal fair market value for any
asset held by the Trust. This right is exercisable by the Company in a nonfiduciary capacity without the approval or consent of any person in a fiduciary capacity; provided, however, that such assets and asset values must be confirmed and agreed by
the Trustee prior to any such substitution as provided by this Section 6(g).         

(g) 
   Except for insurance contracts, the value of any assets reacquired under Section 6(f) shall be determined as provided in this paragraph. The
value of any insurance contract reacquired under Section 6(f) shall be the present value of future projected cash flow or benefits payable under the Contract, but not less than the cash surrender value. The projection shall include death
benefits based on reasonable mortality assumptions, including known facts specifically relating to the health of the insured and the terms of the Contract to be reacquired. Values shall be reasonably determined by the Trustee and may be based
on the determination of agents or experts selected by the Trustee. The Trustee shall have the right, but shall be under     
      Page 13  

no duty or obligation, to secure confirmation of value by an agent or expert for all property to be substituted for other property.     
  Section 7.         Insurance Contracts    

(a) 
   To the extent that the Trustee is directed by the Company prior to a Change of Control to invest part or all of the Trust Fund in insurance
contracts, the type and amount thereof shall be specified by the Company. The Trustee shall be under no duty to make inquiry as to the propriety of the type or amount so specified.     

(b) 
   Each insurance contract issued shall provide that the Trustee shall be the owner thereof with the power to exercise all rights, privileges, options
and elections granted by or permitted under such contract or under the rules of the insurer. The exercise by the Trustee of any incidents of ownership under any contract shall, prior to a Change of Control, be subject to the direction of the
Company. After a Change of Control, the Trustee shall have all such rights.         

(c) 
   The Trustee shall have no power to name a beneficiary of the policy other than the Trust, to assign the policy (as distinct from conversion of the
policy to a different form) other than to a successor Trustee, or to loan to any person the proceeds of any borrowing against an insurance policy held in the Trust Fund.     
 No insurer shall be deemed to be a party to the Trust and an insurer s obligations shall be measured and determined
solely by the terms of contracts and other agreements executed by the insurer.     Section 8.     Disposition of
Income        

(a) 
   Subject to Sections 2(c) and3, no income received by the Trust may be returned to the Company, but shall be accumulated and reinvested within the
Trust, except for that portion of the assets of the Trust which is determined by the Trustee to be in excess of one-hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the Required Funding Amount. Following a Change of Control, any return of assets pursuant
to this Section 8 (and subject to Sections 2(c) and 3) shall be limited to that portion of the assets which exceeds 120% of the sum of the Required Funding Amount and the Expense Fund as determined by the Trustee in its discretion.
       Section 9.     Accounting by The Trustee    

(a) 
   The Trustee shall keep accurate and detailed records of all investments, receipts, disbursements, and all other transactions required to be made,
including such specific records as shall be agreed upon in writing between the Company and the Trustee and shall deliver an accounting of such accounts and transactions to the Company within forty-five (45) days following the close of each calendar
year and within forty-five (45) days after the removal or resignation of the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver to the Company reports of its     
      Page 14  

receipts and disbursements a Trustee hereunder on a quarterly basis. The Trustee shall deliver to the Company a written account of its administration of the Trust during such year or during the
period from the close of the last preceding year to the date of such removal or resignation setting forth all investments, receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by it, including a description of all securities and investments
purchased and sold with the cost or net proceeds of such purchases or sales (accrued interest paid or receivable being shown separately), and showing all cash, securities and other property held in the Trust at the end of such year or as of the date
of such removal or resignation, as the case may be. The Company may approve such account by an instrument in writing delivered to the Trustee. In the absence of the Company s filing with the Trustee objections to any such account within ninety
(90) days after its receipt, the Company shall be deemed to have so approved such account. In such case, or upon the written approval by the Company of any such account, the Trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be discharged from all
liability to the Company for its acts or failures to act described by such account. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Trustee from having its accounting settled by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee shall be entitled to hold
and to commingle the assets of the Trust in one Fund for investment purposes but at the direction of the Company prior to a Change of Control, the Trustee shall create one or more sub-accounts.     

(b) 
   The Trustee shall from time to time permit public accountant(s) selected by the Company (who may be employees of the Company) to have access during
ordinary business hours to such records as may be necessary to audit the Trustee s accounts.        Section
10.         Responsibility of The Trustee        

(a) 
   The Trustee shall act with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in like
capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, provided, however, that the Trustee shall incur no liability to any person for any action taken pursuant to a direction,
request or approval given by the Company which is contemplated by, and in conformity with, the terms of the Arrangements or this Trust and is given in writing by the Company. In the event of a dispute between the Company and a party, the
Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to resolve the dispute ,  subject, however to Section 2(e) hereof.         

(b) 
   The Company hereby indemnifies the Trustee against losses, liabilities, claims, costs and expenses in connection with the administration of the
Trust, unless resulting from the gross negligence or misconduct of Trustee. To the extent the Company fails to make any payment on account of an indemnity provided in this paragraph 10(b), in a reasonably timely manner, the Trustee may obtain
payment from the Trust. If the Trustee undertakes or defends any litigation arising in connection with this Trust or to protect a Participant s or Beneficiary s rights under the Arrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify the Trustee
against the Trustee s costs, reasonable expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and expenses) relating thereto and to be primarily liable for such payments. If the
    
      Page 15  

Company does not pay such costs, expenses and liabilities in a reasonably timely manner, the Trustee may obtain payment from the Trust.     

(c) 
   Prior to a Change of Control, the Trustee may consult with legal counsel (who may also be counsel for the Company generally) with respect to any of
its duties or obligations hereunder. Following a Change of Control the Trustee shall select independent legal counsel and may consult with counsel or other persons with respect to its duties and with respect to the rights of Participants or
their Beneficiaries under the Arrangements.         

(d) 
   The Trustee may hire agents, accountants, actuaries, investment advisors, financial consultants or other professionals to assist it in performing
any of its duties or obligations hereunder and may rely on any determinations made by such agents and information provided to it by the Company.         

(e) 
   The Trustee shall have, without exclusion, all powers conferred on the Trustee by applicable law, unless expressly provided otherwise herein.

(f) 
   Notwithstanding any powers granted to the Trustee pursuant to this Trust Agreement or to applicable law, the Trustee shall not have any power that
could give this Trust the objective of carrying on a business and dividing the gains therefrom, within the meaning of section 301.7701-2 of the Procedure and Administrative Regulations promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.
       Section 11.         Taxes, Compensation and Expenses of The Trustee 

(a) 
 The Company shall from time to time pay taxes of any and all kinds whatsoever that at any time are lawfully levied or assessed upon the Company or become payable by the Company in respect of the Trust Fund, the income
or any property forming a part thereof, or any security transaction pertaining thereto. All references in this Trust Agreement to the payment of taxes shall include interest and applicable penalties. The Trustee shall comply with all
Federal and State tax filing requirements of the Trust and shall furnish to the Company for its review and comment a draft copy of Form 1041 (U.S. Fiduciary Income Tax Return) or any other tax filings for the Trust together with supporting schedules
a minimum of two weeks prior to the tax return filing due date. To enable the Company to make monthly tax accrual and to compute its estimated income tax obligations, the Trustee will furnish, on or prior to the eighth business day of the succeeding
month, a monthly report identifying the type and amount of income by source of investment (interest, dividends, etc.).        

(b) 
   The Trustee s compensation shall be as agreed in writing from time to time by the Company and the Trustee. The Company shall pay all
administrative expenses and the Trustee s fees and shall promptly reimburse the Trustee for any fees and expenses of its agents. If not so     
      Page 16  

paid, the fees and expenses shall be paid from the Trust.     
  Section 12.         Resignation and Removal of The Trustee    

(a) 
   Prior to a Change of Control, the Trustee may resign at any time by written notice to the Company, which shall be effective sixty (60) days after
receipt of such notice unless the Company and the Trustee agree otherwise. Following a Change of Control, the Trustee may resign only after the appointment of a successor Trustee.     

(b) 
   The Trustee may be removed by the Company on sixty days (60) days notice or upon shorter notice accepted by the Trustee prior to a Change of
Control. Subsequent to a Change of Control, the Trustee may only be removed by the Company with the written consent of a seventy-five percent (75%) majority of the Participants and Beneficiaries.     

(c) 
   If the Trustee resigns within two years after a Change of Control, as defined herein, the Company ,  or if the Company fails to act within a
reasonable period of time following such resignation, the Trustee shall apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee or for instructions.     

(d) 
   Upon resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee, all assets shall subsequently be transferred to the successor
Trustee. The transfer shall be completed within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice of resignation, removal or transfer, unless the Company extends the time limit.     

(e) 
   If the Trustee resigns or is removed, a successor shall be appointed by the Company, in accordance with Section 13 hereof, by the effective date of
resignation or removal under paragraph(s) (a) or (b) of this section. If no such appointment has been made, the Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor or for instructions. All expenses of the
Trustee in connection with the proceeding shall be allowed as administrative expenses of the Trust.        Section
13.         Appointment of Successor        

(a) 
   If the Trustee resigns or is removed in accordance with Section 12 hereof, the Company may appoint, subject to Section 12, any third party national
banking association with a market capitalization exceeding $100,000,000 to replace the Trustee upon resignation or removal. The successor Trustee shall have all of the rights and powers of the former Trustee, including ownership rights in the
Trust. The former Trustee shall execute any instrument necessary or reasonably requested by the Company or the successor Trustee to evidence the transfer.     

(b) 
   The successor Trustee need not examine the records and acts of any prior Trustee and may retain or dispose of existing Trust assets, subject to
Section 8 and 9 hereof. The successor Trustee shall not be responsible for and the Company shall indemnify and defend the successor Trustee from any claim or liability resulting from any action or inaction of any
    
      Page 17  

prior Trustee or from any other past event, or any condition existing at the time it becomes successor Trustee.     
  Section 14.          Amendment or Termination    

(a) 
   This Trust Agreement may be amended by a written instrument executed by the Trustee and the Company.    Prior to a Change of
Control, the Company may amend Attachment I to add new Arrangements or to delete Arrangements which have been paid in full, and at any time and from time to time may amend Attachment II, the list of individuals authorized to act on behalf of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment shall conflict with the terms of the Arrangements or shall make the Trust revocable other than is provided in Section 5(b).     

(b) 
   The Trust shall not terminate until the date on which Participants and their Beneficiaries have received all of the benefits due to them under the
terms and conditions of the Arrangements.         

(c) 
   Upon written approval of a 75% of the majority of the Participants or Beneficiaries entitled to payment of benefits pursuant to the terms of the
Arrangements, the Company may terminate this Trust prior to the time all benefit payments under the Arrangements have been made. All assets in the Trust at termination shall be returned to the Company.     

(d) 
   This Trust Agreement may not be amended or terminated by the Company for two (2) years following a Change of Control without the written consent of
a seventy-five percent (75%) majority of the Participants and Beneficiaries, and no such amendment shall adversely affect any benefits of a Participant or Beneficiary without the written consent of the affected person..

Exhibit 10.17.6  
  THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE TRUST AGREEMENT UNDER THE   
  PHILLIPS PETROLEUM COMPANY   
  GRANTOR TRUST AGREEMENT   
  WHEREAS , Phillips Petroleum Company (hereinafter  Company ) and Wachovia Bank, National Association (the  Trustee )
entered into an amended and restated trust agreement as of June 1, 1998, subsequently amended as of May 3, 1999 and as of January 15, 2002 (the  Trust Agreement ) establishing a trust (the  Trust ) for the purpose
of holding monies and other property in connection with certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans maintained by the Employer (the  Plans  and  
  WHEREAS , pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Trust Agreement, the Trust Agreement may be amended by a written
instrument executed by the Trustee and the Company;     NOW, THEREFORE, the Trust Agreement is amended, effective
October 5, 2006, as follows :      

1. 
   The  Company , as defined in the Trust Agreement, is ConocoPhillips Company, formerly known as Phillips Petroleum Company and the name of
the Trust shall be the  ConocoPhillips Grantor Trust .         

2. 
   Section 1 (g) of the Trust Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:     
 (g) Upon a Change in Control, the Company shall, as soon as possible, but in no event longer than thirty (30) days
following the occurrence of a Change in Control, as defined herein, make an irrevocable contribution to the Trust in an amount that is sufficient to fund the Trust in an amount equal to no less than one hundred percent (100%) but no more than
one-hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the Required Funding Amount, together with the amount of the Expense Account as established by the Trustee pursuant to Section 1(h). The determination of such Required Funding Amount to be
contributed after a Change in Control shall be determined by the Trustee in the manner described below, and such amounts shall be communicated to the Company by the Trustee in writing. The  Required Funding Amount  shall mean an amount
that is sufficient, when aggregated with the other assets of the Trust, to cause the value of the Trust Fund following such contribution to be no less than the amount required to fully fund one hundred percent (100%) of the amount necessary to
fund all benefit to which Participants and their Beneficiaries are entitled pursuant to the terms of the Agreements. The Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall make the determination of the Required Funding Amount, and in making this determination
the Trustee shall determine the amount of defined benefit obligations under the Arrangements as of January 1 of the prior calendar year, and as to all defined contribution and deferred compensation obligations, the amount shall be determined as
of  

the end of the month immediately preceding the Change in Control. Such contributed amounts shall be held, administered and disposed of by the Trustee as provided in this Trust Agreement. At any
time during the calendar year that the Company supplies the Trustee with updated benefit data the Trustee shall determine whether additional contributions are required to fully satisfy all Company benefit obligations under the Arrangements in
respect of such updated information. In making its independent determination of the Required Funding Amount following a Change in Control, the Trustee may consider information provided by the Company or any third parties engaged by the Company to
make such funding determinations, but must nonetheless make an independent determination of the Required Funding Amount subject to the following:      

(1) 
   for individual deferred compensation account balances and defined contribution obligations, the third party recordkeeper s data shall be
presumed correct unless demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence to be in error;         

(2) 
   for defined benefit obligations, the actuarial assumptions used by such third party to calculate the funding required shall be the same as those
used the actuary for the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan, formerly known as the Retirement Income Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company, (the  CPRP Assumptions ) to determine the funding required under ERISA for such plan, and if the third
party uses different actuarial assumptions, then the Trustee shall engage an actuary to determine such amounts using the CPRP Assumptions; provided, however that if in the Trustee s sole and absolute discretion, it determines that the CPRP
Assumptions are unreasonable in any manner for the proper determination of such funding obligations, then the Trustee may, upon written notice to the Company, have such funding amount determined by an actuary of its own choosing using actuarial
assumptions determined by the Trustee, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be reasonable; and         

(3) 
   for any additional funding required by a determination of the Trustee of additional benefits due to a Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to an
appeal to the Trustee under Section 2(b) of this Trust Agreement, the Trustee s determination of any required additional funding shall control.         

3. 
   Section 1(i) of the Trust Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following substituted with the following:     
 (i) In its discretion, the Trustee may institute an action to collect a contribution due the Trust following a Change in
Control or in the event that the Trust should, following a Change in Control, ever experience a short-fall in the amount of assets necessary to make payments pursuant to  

the terms of the Arrangements, or if the Company should ever fail to contribute the amounts requested by the Trustee pursuant to Section 1(g).  

4. 
   Section 3 (d) of the Trust Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:     
 (d) For purposes of this Section 3, Company shall include its Participating Subsidiaries, where  Participating Subsidiary  is
defined as ConocoPhillips and a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, of which ConocoPhillips beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding classes and series of stock, where such subsidiary has
adopted one or more of the Arrangements and has employed one or more Participants.      

5. 
 Section 6(b) of the Trust Agreement is hereby amended to delete the opening phrases,  Subject to investment guidelines agreed to in writing from time to time by the Company and the Trustee prior to a Change in
Control, the Trustee shall have the power in investing and reinvesting the Fund in its sole discretion  and to replace those phrases with the following:    
 Prior to a Change in Control, and subject to the Company s exercise of its rights under Section 6(c) of the Trust, the Trustee
shall have the following powers in investing and reinvesting the Fund in its sole discretion, subject to investment guidelines provided in writing from time to time by the Company:  

6. 
   The following section (e) is added to Section 14 of the Trust Agreement:     
 (e) The Company may merge other grantor trusts covering similar benefit plans into the Trust, by Amendment to this Trust agreed to in writing
by the Company and the Trustee.

Board (the  Incumbent Board ) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to October 5, 2006, whose election, or nomination for election by

    Exercise Installments and Expiration . Stock Options/SAR s granted under this Agreement will become exercisable to the extent that one
third of the number of shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option/SAR (rounded down to nearest whole share) shall be exercisable on the first anniversary date of the Stock Option/SAR grant. On the second anniversary date of the Stock Option/SAR
grant, an additional one third of the number of shares of Stock (rounded down to nearest whole share) shall become exercisable. On the third anniversary date of the Stock Option/SAR grant, the remaining shares shall become exercisable. To the extent

date on which it was granted.         

(b) 
    Last Date to Exercise (Terminations) .     

(i) 
    General Rule for Termination . If, prior to the exercise of Stock Options/SAR grants, the Optionee s employment with a Participating
Company shall be terminated for any reason except death, Disability, Retirement, or Layoff, such Award shall be canceled and all rights thereunder shall cease; provided that the Authorized Party may, in its or his sole discretion, determine that all
or any portion of any other Award shall not be canceled due to Termination of Employment.     
      - 2 -  

(ii) 
    Layoff Within Six Months . If, prior to a date six months from the date an Award is granted, the Optionee s employment with a
Participating Company shall be terminated by reason of Layoff, such Award shall be canceled and all rights thereunder shall cease.         

(iii) 
    Layoff After Six Months but Within One Year . If, on or after a date six months from the date an Award is granted but prior to a date one
year from the date an Award is granted, the Optionee s employment with a Participating Company shall be terminated by reason of Layoff, the Optionee shall retain a prorated number of the Award shares granted. The number of Award shares retained
will be computed by multiplying the original number of Award shares granted by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of employment from the first day of the month in which the Award was granted until the date the employee
is terminated and the denominator of which is 12. Such calculation shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.         

(iv) 
    Layoff After One Year . If, on or after a date one year from the date an Award is granted, the Optionee s employment with a
Participating Company shall be terminated by reason of Layoff, the Optionee shall retain all rights provided by the Award at the time of such Termination of Employment.     

(v)

transferred by the executor or the administrator pursuant to will or the laws of descent and distribution shall have the right to exercise the Award to the same extent the Optionee could have, had the Optionee not died. No transfer of an Award by
the Optionee by will or by the laws of descent and distribution shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Company shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and a copy of the will and such other evidence as the Company may deem
necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and the acceptance by the transferee or transferees of the terms and conditions of such Award.         

(viii) 
    Transfers and Leaves . Transfer of employment between Participating Companies shall not constitute Termination of Employment for the purpose
of any Award granted under the Program. Whether any leave of absence shall constitute Termination of Employment for the purposes of any Award granted under the Program shall be determined in each case in accordance with applicable law and by
application of the policies and procedures adopted by the Company in relation to such leave of absence.         

(ix) 
    Divestiture, Outsourcing, or Move to Joint Venture . If, after the date the Award is granted, an Optionee ceases to be employed by a

Authorized Party to be considered a divestiture under this program, the Authorized Party may, in its or his sole discretion, determine that all or a portion of any such Award shall not be canceled.     

(x) 
    Change of Control . Upon a Change of Control, the following shall apply to any Stock Option (or SAR):     

(1) 
   Each Employee shall immediately become fully vested in such Stock Option (or SAR) that is not assumed, or substituted for, by the an acquirer in
connection with the Change of Control, and such Stock Option or (SAR) shall not thereafter be forfeitable for any reason.     

(2) 
   With regard to any other Stock Option (or SAR), each Employee shall become fully vested in such Stock Option (or SAR) upon incurring a Severance
following such Change of Control, and such Stock Option (or SAR) shall not thereafter be forfeitable for any reason.     

(3) 
   Any Stock Option (or SAR) granted to the Employee shall be exercisable at the times set forth herein. Each such Stock Option (or SAR) shall remain
outstanding until ten years from the date of grant, notwithstanding any provision of the Award Agreement or the Plan to the contrary.         

(c) 
    Detrimental Activities and Suspension of Exercises .     

(i) 
   If the Authorized Party determines that, subsequent to the grant of any Award but prior to any Change of Control, the Employee has engaged or is
engaging in any activity which, in the sole judgment of the Authorized Party, is or may be detrimental to the Company or a subsidiary, the Authorized Party may suspend the right of the Employee to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of the
Employee s Awards already requested, or cancel all or part of the Award granted to the Employee. Upon any Change of Control, the Authorized Party may suspend the right of the Employee to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of the
Employee s Awards already requested, or cancel all or part of the Award granted to the Employee only upon a determination by the Authorized Party that the Employee has given the Company Cause for such cancellation.     

(ii) 
   If the Authorized Party, in its or his sole discretion, determines that the exercise of any Award has the possibility of violating any law,
regulation, or decree pertaining to the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or the Employee, the Authorized Party may freeze or suspend the Employee s right to exercise until such time as the exercise of the Award would no longer, in the sole
discretion of the Authorized Party, have the possibility of violating such law, regulation, or decree.         

(iii) 
   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Award is subject to forfeiture or recoupment, in whole or in part, under applicable law,
including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act.     
      - 4 -  

4. 
     Exercising the Stock Option  . The Company has retained outside firms to administer Stock Options (and SARs) granted under the Plans
(the  third party administrators ). The Option (or SAR) must be exercised in accordance with methods and at times set by the third party administrator and by the Employee s delivering to the third party administrators such
authorization as may be required.         

5. 
     Payment for Shares  . The Grant Price for all shares of Stock purchased upon the exercise of a Stock Option, or a portion thereof,
shall be paid in full at the time of such exercise. Such payment may be made in cash or by tendering shares of Stock having a value on the date of exercise equal to the Grant Price. Such value shall be the average of the high and low trading prices
of the stock on the day of exercise. If the Optionee makes payment of the Grant Price by tendering shares of Stock, such Stock must be registered in the sole name of the Optionee on the exercise date or an appropriate Stock Power acceptable to the
Company to transfer such stock to the sole name of the Optionee must be provided at the time of exercise. In the case of an Optionee who makes payment of the Grant Price by tendering shares of Stock, if the Company deems it appropriate, and if
allowed by the applicable laws, regulations, and rulings, the Company may accept an attestation from the Optionee in lieu of actual physical delivery to the Company of the shares to be tendered. The attestation must indicate the number of shares
held, and if deemed necessary by the Company, the certificate numbers if the Stock is held in certificate form, or the broker and brokerage account number if the shares are held in a brokerage account, and any other information necessary to confirm
ownership of the shares. The Company may not accept an attestation in lieu of physical delivery of the shares unless the shares are held in the sole name of the Optionee either in certificate form, or in a single brokerage account, or in such other
form as the Company may deem appropriate. Depending on its source, Stock tendered in the exercise of a Stock Option must have met the appropriate holding period required by current tax, accounting, legal, or other applicable rules and regulations.
At the election of the Optionee (but subject to any administrative limitations on exercise of Stock Options or permissible methods of option exercise imposed), the Stock Option may also be exercised by a  net-share settlement  method for
exercising outstanding nonqualified stock options. The Committee, in its sole discretion and judgment, limit the extent to which shares of Stock may be used in exercising Stock Options or limit the use of any method or time of option exercise.

6. 
     Assignment of Option and Exercises After Death  . Rights under the Plans and this Agreement cannot be assigned or transferred other
than by (i) will, (ii) beneficiary designation, or (iii) the laws of descent and distribution. In the event that a beneficiary designation conflicts with an assignment by will or under the laws of descent and distribution, the
beneficiary designation will prevail. Upon the death of an Employee, exercise of the grant will be permitted only by the Employee s designated beneficiary, executor, or personal representative of the Employee s estate.

7. 
     Tax Withholding  . In the U.S. and many countries, the difference between the Grant Price and the value of the stock at the time of an
Option exercise multiplied by the number of shares purchased is compensation subject to tax withholding. The Option exercise will not be completed until all federal, state, local, and other governmental withholding tax requirements have been met.
Should a withholding tax obligation arise upon the exercise of a Stock Option, the withholding tax may be satisfied by withholding shares of Stock or by payment of cash. This withholding obligation includes, but is not limited to, federal, state,
and local taxes, including applicable non-U.S. taxes, such as U.K. PAYE. The plan administrator will take such steps, as it deems necessary or desirable for the withholding of any taxes that are required by laws or regulations of any governmental
authority in connection with any exercise. For SARs, the SAR Gain will be paid through the local payroll and is subject to applicable withholding taxes.     
      - 5 -  

8. 
     Shareholder Rights  . The Employee shall not have the rights of a shareholder until the Option (or SAR) has been exercised and
ownership of shares of Common Stock has been transferred to the Employee.         

9. 
     Certain Adjustments  . In the event certain corporate transactions, recapitalizations, or stock splits occur while a Stock Option (or
SAR) is outstanding, the Grant Price and the number of Stock Option Shares (or SARs) shall be correspondingly adjusted.         

10. 
     Relationship to the Plan  .   In addition to the terms and conditions described in this Agreement, Awards are subject to all
other applicable provisions of the Plan. The decisions of the Committee with respect to questions arising as to the interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement or as to findings of fact shall be final, conclusive, and binding.

11. 
     No Employment Guarantee  . No provision of this Agreement shall confer any right upon the Employee to continued employment with any
Participating Company.         

12. 
     Governing Law  . This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

13. 
     Amendment  . Without the consent of the Employee, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented (i) to cure any ambiguity or to
correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or (ii) to add to the covenants and agreements of the Company for the benefit of an Employee or to add to the rights of an
Employee or to surrender any right or power reserved to or conferred upon the Company in this Agreement, provided, in each case, that such changes or corrections shall not adversely affect the rights of the Employee with respect to the grant of an
Option (or SAR) evidenced hereby without the Employee s consent, or (iii) to make such other changes as the Company, upon advice of counsel, determines are necessary or advisable because of the adoption or promulgation of, or change in or
of the interpretation of, any law or governmental rule or regulation, including any applicable federal or state securities or tax laws.

(a) 
    Restrictions and Terms .     

(i) 
   The Award shall be held in escrow by the Company until the lapsing of restrictions placed upon the Award. The Employee shall not have the right to
sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units granted in an Award until the escrow is terminated. Except as set forth below, the Award shall be forfeited and the related Restricted Stock or Restricted
Stock Units canceled upon the Employee s Termination of Employment with the Company prior to the lapsing of restrictions. Restrictions shall lapse on the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units granted in an Award on the third anniversary of
the Grant Date. Upon the lapsing of restrictions, the number of shares of unrestricted Stock equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units for which the restrictions have so lapsed shall be registered in the
Employee s name, and the related shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall be canceled; provided, however, that the Administrator may choose instead to issue any Restricted Stock with the restrictions removed, rather than
cancel such Restricted Stock and issue unrestricted Stock; and further provided, however, that in places where it is determined by the Administrator that payout in the form of unrestricted Stock is prohibited by law, regulation, or decree, or where
the cost of legal compliance to issue the unrestricted Stock would be unreasonably expensive, the Fair Market Value of such unrestricted Stock shall be paid in cash instead of settlement of the Award in unrestricted Stock. Cash payouts are only
permitted where such legal restrictions exist. Settlement of the Award in unrestricted Stock or cash payout, if any, shall be made upon the lapsing of restrictions on the Award, but, in any event, shall be made no later than March 15 of the
year following the year in which such restrictions lapse.

   Restricted Stock Units do not have any voting rights or other rights generally associated with Stock, and are merely an obligation of the Company
to make settlement in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such Restricted Stock Units. Restricted Stock Units granted to Employees who are resident in the United States or the United Kingdom on the Grant Date shall accrue a
dividend equivalent at such times as an ordinary quarterly cash dividend is paid on the Stock of the Company, which dividend equivalent shall be paid in cash to the Employee to whom the Award was made. Restricted Stock Units granted to Employees
other than those described in the previous sentence shall not accrue a dividend equivalent. Payment of a dividend equivalent, if any, shall be made on the first day of the third month of each calendar quarter (or, if the New York Stock Exchange is
not open on such day, the first day that the New York Stock Exchange is open thereafter), and, in any event, shall be made no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the ordinary quarterly cash dividend is paid.

(iii) 
   When an Award is made of Restricted Stock, such Restricted Stock will be held in escrow for the Employee to whom the Award is made. The Employee to
whom the Award is made will have all rights of ownership to such stock including, but not limited to, voting rights and the right to receive dividends, except that the Employee to whom the Award is made shall not have the right to sell, transfer,
assign, or otherwise dispose of such shares until the escrow is terminated. The escrow shall end upon, and to the extent of, the lapsing of restrictions.

and all rights thereunder shall cease; provided, however, that the Authorized Party may, in its or his sole discretion, determine that all or any portion of an Award shall not be canceled due to Termination of Employment.     

(ii) 
    Layoff Within Six Months . If, prior to a date six months from the date an Award is granted, the Employee s employment with a
Participating Company shall be terminated by reason of Layoff, such Award shall be canceled and all rights thereunder shall cease.         

(iii) 
    Layoff Within One Year . If, on or after a date six months from the date an Award is granted but prior to a date one year from the date an
Award is granted, the Employee s employment with a Participating Company shall be terminated by reason of Layoff, the Employee shall retain a prorated number of the Award shares or units granted. The number of Award shares or units retained
will be computed by multiplying the original number of Award shares or units granted by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of employment from the first day of the month in which the Award was granted until the date the
employee is terminated and the denominator of which is 12. Such calculation shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. In such case, the restrictions on the prorated Award shall lapse on the date of Termination of the Employee from the employ
of the Company and its subsidiaries, and settlement shall be made in accordance with the settlement provisions above.         

(iv) 
    Layoff After One Year . If, on or after a date one year from the date an Award is granted, the Employee s employment with a
Participating Company shall be terminated by reason of Layoff, the Employee shall retain all rights provided by the Award at the time of such Termination of Employment. In such case, the restrictions on the Award shall lapse on the date of

transferred by the executor or the administrator pursuant to will or the laws of descent and distribution shall have the right to settlement of the Award to the same extent the Employee would have, had the Employee not died. In such case, the
restrictions on the Award shall lapse upon the determination of death by the Administrator, and settlement shall be made in accordance with the settlement provisions above. No transfer of an Award, or of the unrestricted Stock or other proceeds of
an Award, by the Employee by will or by the laws of descent and distribution shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Administrator shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and a copy of the will and such other evidence as the
Administrator may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and the acceptance by the transferee or transferees of the terms and conditions of such Award.

to exercise of an Award, or (e) any other sale of assets determined by the Authorized Party to be considered a divestiture under this program, the Authorized Party may, in its or his sole discretion, determine that all or a portion of any such
Award shall not be canceled. In such cases, the restrictions on the Award shall lapse on the date of Termination of the Employee from the employ of the Company and its subsidiaries, and settlement shall be made in accordance with the settlement

withholding tax obligation arise with regard to an Award or the lapsing of restrictions on Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units granted in an Award, the withholding tax may be satisfied by withholding shares of Stock. The value of the shares
of Stock withheld for this purpose shall be an amount consistent with applicable laws and regulations. In cases where a withholding tax obligation arises prior to the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units granted in an

the Employee shall be responsible for paying such interest, which shall be withheld from pay over the same six-month period. In cases where payment by payroll withholding cannot be made due to circumstances arising after the election or where the
Administrator has determined that such withholding would violate any applicable law, regulation, or decree, shares of Stock shall be withheld instead. When necessary, lapsing of restrictions may be accelerated by the Authorized Party to the extent
necessary to provide shares of Stock to satisfy any withholding tax obligation. This withholding tax obligation includes, but is not limited to, federal, state, and local taxes, including applicable non-U.S. taxes such as U.K. PAYE. If Australian
tax law applies to the Employee, then an Award is a scheme to which Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of Australia applies (subject to the conditions in that Act).     

6. 
     Shareholder Rights for Restricted Stock Units  . The Employee shall not have the rights of a shareholder until the Restricted Stock
Unit has been canceled and ownership of shares of Stock has been transferred to the Employee. As described above, the Company may pay dividend equivalents with regard to Restricted Stock Units in certain circumstances.     

7. 
     Certain Adjustments  . In the event certain corporate transactions, recapitalizations, or stock splits occur while Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Units are outstanding, the Grant Price and the number of shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall be correspondingly adjusted.     

8. 
     Relationship to the Plan  . In addition to the terms and conditions described in this Agreement, Awards are subject to all other
applicable provisions of the Plan. The decisions of the Committee with respect to questions arising as to the interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement or as to findings of fact shall be final, conclusive, and binding.     

9. 
     No Employment Guarantee  . No provision of this Agreement shall confer any right upon the Employee to continued employment with any
Participating Company.         

10. 
     Governing Law  . This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

11. 
     Amendment  . Without the consent of the Employee, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented (i) to cure any ambiguity or to
correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or (ii) to add to the covenants and agreements of the Company for the benefit of an Employee or to add to the rights of an
Employee or to surrender any right or power reserved to or conferred upon the Company in this Agreement, provided, in each case, that such changes or corrections shall not adversely affect the rights of the Employee with respect to the grant of an
Award evidenced hereby without the Employee s consent, or (iii) to make such other changes as the Company, upon advice of counsel, determines are necessary or advisable because of the adoption or promulgation of, or change in or of the

PERFORMANCE SHARE PROGRAM    
  FEBRUARY 16, 2016      TARGET
AWARD FOR PERFORMANCE PERIOD XIV      PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT   
  AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS   
 These Performance Share Unit Award Terms and Conditions describe terms and conditions of Performance Share Unit Awards, as part of the
ConocoPhillips Performance Share Program (Program), granted under the 2014 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (referred to as the Plan) by ConocoPhillips (Company) to you as an eligible employee (Employee). These Terms
and Conditions, together with the Award Summary given to each Employee receiving an Award, form the Award Agreement (the Agreement) relating to the Awards described. Subject to the Plan and this Agreement, the Company grants to the Employee
Performance Share Units. Individual awards will be as set forth in the Award Summary given to each Employee to whom an Award is granted. The Award Summary for each Employee is made a part of this Agreement with regard to such Employee. The Award
Summary may be modified at any time to reflect increased or decreased amounts of the Award due to promotion or demotion of the Employee and due to decisions made with regard to this Performance Period XIV of the Program, including adjustments
related to the performance of the Company and adjustments related to the performance of the Employee; provided, however, that after a Change of Control occurs, there shall be no decrease in the number of PSUs granted, except pursuant to the section
titled  Detrimental Activities  below. Multiple book entry accounts may be used to reflect the total shares awarded under these Terms and Conditions. This and any other administrative activities shall not be construed to alter these Terms
and Conditions.     AWARD :         Performance Share Unit
(PSU) Award granted by the Authorized Party under the provisions of the Plan. The PSUs will be noted in a book entry account created for the Employee.  
  PSU :
                A unit evidencing the right to receive either one share of ConocoPhillips Stock, $0.01 par value, or the Fair Market Value thereof under the
circumstances described in these Terms and Conditions.     VOTING RIGHTS :   The named
owner of the PSUs has no voting rights for the units, but is considered the beneficial owner for all purposes including ownership and control reports such as the annual proxy statement.  
  DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS :   Dividend equivalent payment, equal to the regular dividend payment
as declared by the Board of Directors on an equivalent number of common stock from time to time, will be made to the named owner of the units beginning after 2018. No such dividend equivalent payments shall be made prior to 2019, nor shall such
dividend equivalent payments accrue or be owed with regard to any time prior to 2019. Under  
      - 1 -  

current U.S. tax law, these payments are taxable as compensation ( i.e. , ordinary income) in the year distributed.  
  RETIREMENT PLAN EARNINGS :   The issuance of these PSUs does not constitute earnings under
any retirement plan sponsored by a ConocoPhillips company. The value of the units at the time restrictions lapse also does not constitute earnings under any retirement plan sponsored by a ConocoPhillips company. Neither the issuance of nor lapsing
of restrictions on PSUs will have any impact on any retirement plans or any other compensation plan sponsored by a ConocoPhillips company.  
  TAX INFORMATION :   For an Employee subject to U.S. tax laws, this matter is more
thoroughly covered in the document entitled  Tax Aspects of Performance Share Units.  However, in general terms, under current U.S. tax law, the value of these units is not considered taxable income until the restrictions lapse.  
  BENEFICIARY :   In the event of the death of the named owner of these units prior to the
lapsing of restrictions for other reasons, such restrictions will lapse and shares of unrestricted common stock equal in number to the PSUs will be issued to the beneficiary designated by the named owner of the units.  
  CHANGE OF CONTROL :   Upon a Change of Control, the following shall apply to the PSUs:  

1. 
   Each Employee shall immediately become fully vested in such PSUs that are not assumed, or substituted for, by the an acquirer in connection with
the Change of Control, and such PSUs shall not thereafter be forfeitable for any reason, except as set forth in the section titled  Detrimental Activities  below.     

2. 
   With regard to any other PSUs, each Employee shall become fully vested in such PSUs upon incurring a Severance following such Change of Control,
and such PSUs shall not thereafter be forfeitable for any reason, except as set forth in the section titled  Detrimental Activities  below.     

3. 
   In the event of vesting of PSUs pursuant to either paragraph 1 or 2 above, all restrictions and other limitations applicable to the PSUs shall
lapse and the PSUs shall be settled in unrestricted Stock or cash at the same times and upon the same events as it would otherwise have been made in accordance with the settlement provisions below.     
  RESTRICTIONS :   The following restrictions relate to the PSUs:  
 The PSUs will be held in escrow for the Employee. As provided herein, the Employee will have all rights of economic ownership
to such unit including the right to receive dividend equivalents, except that the Employee shall not have the right to sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of such units until the escrow is terminated (such restrictions being known as the
 Transfer Restrictions ).    Unless postponed pursuant to an effective election, as described in the section
titled  Initial Election  below, the escrow shall end on the earliest of any of the following occurrences, with Transfer Restrictions to lapse and settlement be made as set forth in the section titled  Settlement  below:  
      - 2 -  

1. 
   The Termination of the Employee s employment as a result of Layoff of the Employee;     

2. 
   The Termination of the Employee s employment after attainment of age 55 and completion of 5 years of service with the Company or its
subsidiaries;     

3. 
   The Termination of the Employee s employment due to death;     

4. 
   The Termination of the Employee s employment following Disability of the Employee;     

5. 
   The Termination of the Employee s employment following a Change of Control; or     
 
 In the absence of an effective election, as described in the section titled  Initial Election  below, the Transfer
Restrictions shall lapse and the PSUs (including any such that are awarded after the Separation from Service of the Employee) shall be settled in cash on the date that is the later of (a) the end of the escrow period and (b) the earliest
of the Employee s death, February 19, 2019, or six months after the date of the Employee s Separation from Service for a reason other than death; provided, however, that settlement shall not be made before February 19, 2019.  
  INITIAL ELECTION :   If the Employee is eligible for participation in the Key Employee
Deferred Compensation Plan of ConocoPhillips (KEDCP), the Employee may elect on an election form delivered to the Plan Administrator at a time set by the Plan Administrator (which shall be on or before December 31, 2015) to have the settlement
in cash replaced with an account in lieu thereof to be created in KEDCP, with distribution from KEDCP to be made in accordance with the election of the Employee and any subsequent elections allowed under the provisions of KEDCP. Upon creation of
such an account, the related PSUs shall be canceled.    In the absence of such an election, the escrow will end and
settlement shall be made in one lump sum payment in cash at the time set forth in the section titled  Restrictions  above.  
  SETTLEMENT :   Unless deferred as described in the section titled  Initial
Election  above, the Company shall, at the time stated above, deliver to each Employee an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the PSUs, and the related PSUs shall be canceled. In all cases the Employee will be responsible to pay all
required withholding taxes associated with the Award. The Employee must pay any required withholding taxes by having shares equal in value to the applicable withholding taxes withheld by the Company (or such other method as the Company, in its sole
discretion, allows). The value of the shares withheld for this purpose shall be an amount consistent with the applicable laws and regulations. If Australian tax law applies to the Employee, then an Award is a scheme to which Subdivision 83A-C of the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of Australia applies (subject to the conditions in that Act).    The Fair Market Value of
the Award received by the Employee shall be determined in accordance with the definition and principles set forth in the Plan.  
      - 3 -  

FORFEITURE : An Employee s right, title, and
interest in Performance Share Units awarded under the PSP or derived from such Performance Share Units, or the ownership thereof, shall be forfeited if the Employee terminates employment prior to termination of the escrow period; provided, however,
any transfer between the Company and any Subsidiary, or between Subsidiaries at the request of the Company or such Subsidiaries, shall not result in forfeiture.  
  DETRIMENTAL ACTIVITIES :   If the Authorized Party determines that, subsequent to the grant
of any Award but prior to any Change of Control, the Employee has engaged or is engaging in any activity which, in the sole judgment of the Authorized Party, is or may be detrimental to the Company or a subsidiary, the Authorized Party may cancel
all or part of the PSUs held in escrow pursuant to the Award granted to that Employee. Upon any Change of Control, the Authorized Party may cancel all or part of the PSUs held in escrow pursuant to the Award granted to that Employee only upon a
determination by the Authorized Party that the Employee has given the Company Cause for such cancellation.    If the
Authorized Party, in its or his sole discretion, determines that the lapsing of restrictions on PSUs held in escrow pursuant to any Award has the possibility of violating any law, regulation, or decree pertaining to the Company, any of its
subsidiaries, or the Employee, the Authorized Party may freeze or suspend the Employee s right to settlement or payout of the Award until such time as the lapse of restrictions would no longer, in the sole discretion of the Authorized Party,
have the possibility of violating such law, regulation, or decree.    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Award is subject to forfeiture or recoupment, in whole or in part, under applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act.  
  RECAPITALIZATION :   Upon any change in the outstanding stock of the Company by reason of
any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, or other similar change, the Committee shall make corresponding adjustments to the PSUs.

  FEBRUARY 16, 2016      TARGET
AWARD FOR PERFORMANCE PERIOD XIV      PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT   
  AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS      FOR
ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ON THE CANADA PAYROLL     These Performance Share Unit Award Terms and Conditions describe terms and conditions of Performance Share
Unit Awards, as part of the ConocoPhillips Performance Share Program (Program), granted under the 2014 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (referred to as the Plan) by ConocoPhillips (Company) to you as an eligible
employee (Employee). These Terms and Conditions, together with the Award Summary given to each Employee receiving an Award, form the Award Agreement (the Agreement) relating to the Awards described. Subject to the Plan and this Agreement, the
Company grants to the Employee Performance Share Units. Individual awards will be as set forth in the Award Summary given to each Employee to whom an Award is granted. The Award Summary for each Employee is made a part of this Agreement with regard
to such Employee. The Award Summary may be modified at any time to reflect increased or decreased amounts of the Award due to promotion or demotion of the Employee and due to decisions made with regard to this Performance Period XIV of the Program,
including adjustments related to the performance of the Company and adjustments related to the performance of the Employee; provided, however, that after a Change of Control occurs, there shall be no decrease in the number of PSUs granted, except
pursuant to the section titled  Detrimental Activities  below. Multiple book entry accounts may be used to reflect the total shares awarded under these Terms and Conditions. This and any other administrative activities shall not be
construed to alter these Terms and Conditions.      

AWARD : 
   Performance Share Unit (PSU) Award granted by the Authorized Party under the provisions of the Plan. The PSUs will be noted in a book entry account
created for the Employee.         

PSU : 
   A unit evidencing the right to receive either one share of ConocoPhillips Stock, $0.01 par value, or the Fair Market Value thereof under the
circumstances described in these Terms and Conditions.        VOTING RIGHTS : The named owner of
the PSUs has no voting rights for the units, but is considered the beneficial owner for all purposes including ownership and control reports such as the annual proxy statement.  
  DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS : Dividend equivalent payment, equal to the regular dividend payment as declared by the Board of
Directors on an equivalent number of common stock from time to time, will be made to the named owner of the units beginning after 2018. No such dividend equivalent payments shall be made prior to 2019, nor shall such dividend
 
      - 1 -  

equivalent payments accrue or be owed with regard to any time prior to 2019. Under current tax law, these payments are taxable as compensation in the year distributed.  
  RETIREMENT PLAN EARNINGS : The issuance of these PSUs does not constitute earnings under any retirement plan
sponsored by a ConocoPhillips company. The value of the units at the time restrictions lapse also does not constitute earnings under any retirement plan sponsored by a ConocoPhillips company. Neither the issuance of nor lapsing of restrictions on
PSUs will have any impact on any retirement plans or any other compensation plan sponsored by a ConocoPhillips company.  
  TAX INFORMATION : For an Employee subject to U.S. tax laws, this matter is more thoroughly covered in the document
entitled  Tax Aspects of Performance Share Units.  Other Employees should consult their tax advisors. However, in general terms, under current tax law, the value of these units is not considered taxable income until the restrictions lapse.
    BENEFICIARY : In the event of the death of the named owner of these units prior to the lapsing of restrictions
for other reasons, such restrictions will lapse and shares of unrestricted common stock equal in number to the PSUs will be issued to the beneficiary designated by the named owner of the units.

2. 
   With regard to any other PSUs, each Employee shall become fully vested in such PSUs upon incurring a Severance following such Change of Control,
and such PSUs shall not thereafter be forfeitable for any reason, except as set forth in the section titled  Detrimental Activities  below.     

3. 
   In the event of vesting of PSUs pursuant to either paragraph 1 or 2 above, all restrictions and other limitations applicable to the PSUs shall
lapse and the PSUs shall be settled in unrestricted Stock or cash at the same times and upon the same events as it would otherwise have been made in accordance with the settlement provisions below.

(a) the end of the escrow period and (b) the earliest of the Employee s death, February 19, 2019, or six months after the date of the Employee s Separation from Service for a reason other than death; provided, however, that
settlement shall not be made before February 19, 2019.     INITIAL ELECTION : The Employee may elect on an
election form delivered to the Plan Administrator at a time set by the Plan Administrator (which shall be on or before December 31, 2015) to have the escrow for the PSUs continue and the Transfer Restrictions applicable to these PSUs continue

7. 
   No more than four such elections shall be permitted with respect to the PSUs subject to this Award; and     

8. 
   No payment may be made after the date that is twenty (20) years after the date of the Employee s Separation from Service.
      If an election under this section becomes effective, the escrow and the Transfer Restrictions

withholding taxes by having shares equal in value to the applicable withholding taxes withheld by the Company (or such other method as the Company, in its sole discretion, allows). The value of the shares withheld for this purpose shall be an amount
consistent with the applicable laws and regulations. With regard to any fractional shares of Stock that might arise, the Company may deliver to the Employee cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional shares. If Australian tax law applies
to the Employee, then an Award is a scheme to which Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of Australia applies (subject to the conditions in that Act).  
 The Fair Market Value of the Award received by the Employee shall be determined in accordance with the definition and
principles set forth in the Plan.     FORFEITURE : An Employee s right, title, and interest in Performance
Share Units awarded under the PSP or derived from such Performance Share Units, or the ownership thereof, shall be forfeited if the Employee terminates employment prior to termination of the escrow period; provided, however, any transfer between the
Company and any Subsidiary, or between Subsidiaries at the request of the Company or such Subsidiaries, shall not result in forfeiture.  
  DETRIMENTAL ACTIVITIES : If the Authorized Party determines that, subsequent to the grant of any Award but prior to
any Change of Control, the Employee has engaged or is engaging in any activity which, in the sole judgment of the Authorized Party, is or may be detrimental to the Company or a subsidiary, the Authorized Party may cancel all or part of the PSUs held
in escrow pursuant to the Award granted to that Employee. Upon any Change of Control, the Authorized Party may cancel all or part of the PSUs held in escrow pursuant to the Award granted to that Employee only upon a determination by the Authorized
Party that the Employee has given the Company Cause for such cancellation.    If the Authorized Party, in its or his sole
discretion, determines that the lapsing of restrictions on PSUs held in escrow pursuant to any Award has the possibility of violating any law, regulation, or decree pertaining to the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or the Employee, the Authorized
Party may freeze or suspend the Employee s right to settlement or payout of the Award until such time as the lapse of restrictions would no  
      - 4 -  

longer, in the sole discretion of the Authorized Party, have the possibility of violating such law, regulation, or decree.  
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Award is subject to forfeiture or recoupment, in whole or in part,
under applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act.     RECAPITALIZATION : Upon any
change in the outstanding stock of the Company by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, or other similar change, the Committee shall make corresponding adjustments to the PSUs.

  DeGolyer and MacNaughton     5001
Spring Valley Road    Suite 800 East  
 Dallas, Texas 75244    February 23, 2016  
 ConocoPhillips    600 North Dairy Ashford  
 Houston, Texas 77079    Re: SEC Process Review  
 Ladies and Gentlemen:  
     Pursuant to your request, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has performed a process review of the processes and
controls used within ConocoPhillips in preparing its internal estimates of proved reserves, as of December 31, 2015. The process review, which is contemplated by Item 1202 (a) (8) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), has been performed specifically to address the adequacy and effectiveness of ConocoPhillips  internal processes and controls relative to its estimation of proved reserves in compliance with Rules 4 10(a)
(1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC.        DeGolyer and MacNaughton has participated as
an independent member of the internal ConocoPhillips Reserves Compliance Assessment Team in reviews and discussions with each of the relevant ConocoPhillips business units relative to SEC proved reserves estimation. DeGolyer and MacNaughton
participated in the review of all major fields in all countries where ConocoPhillips has proved reserves worldwide, which ConocoPhillips has indicated represents over 90 percent of its estimated total proved reserves as of December 31, 2015.
       The reviews with ConocoPhillips  technical staff involved presentations and discussions of a)
basic reservoir data, including seismic data, well log data, pressure and production tests, core analysis, pressure-volume-temperature data, and production history, b) technical methods employed in SEC proved reserves estimation, including
performance analysis, geology, mapping, and volumetric estimates, c) economic analysis, and d) commercial assessment, including the legal basis for the interest in the reserves, primarily related to lease agreements and other petroleum license
agreements, such as concession and production sharing agreements.  

ConocoPhillips  
 February 23, 2016    Page 2 of 2  
     A field examination of the properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this review of
ConocoPhillips  processes and controls.        It is our opinion that ConocoPhillips  estimates
of proved reserves for the properties reviewed were prepared by the use of recognized geologic and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was
tempered by ConocoPhillips  experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history. It is our opinion that the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in
estimating its December 31, 2015, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions.  
     This process review of ConocoPhillips  procedures and methods does not constitute a review, study,
or independent audit of ConocoPhillips  estimated proved reserves and corresponding future net revenues. This report is not intended to indicate that DeGolyer and MacNaughton is offering any opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves
estimates reported by ConocoPhillips.        DeGolyer and MacNaughton is an independent petroleum
engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world since 1936. Neither DeGolyer and MacNaughton nor any employee who participated in this project has any financial interest, including stock
ownership, in ConocoPhillips. Our fees were not contingent on the results of our evaluation.    Very truly yours,
