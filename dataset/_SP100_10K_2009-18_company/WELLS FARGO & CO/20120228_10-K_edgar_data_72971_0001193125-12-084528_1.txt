PART I.        

ITEM 1.   
   BUSINESS         Wells Fargo   Company
is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and a financial holding company and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). Its principal business is to act as a holding company for
its subsidiaries. References in this report to  the Parent  mean the holding company. References to  we,   our,   us  or  the Company  mean the holding company and its subsidiaries that are
consolidated for financial reporting purposes.      At December 31, 2011, we had assets of $1.3 trillion, loans of
$770 billion, deposits of $920 billion and stockholders  equity of $140 billion. Based on assets, we were the fourth largest bank holding company in the United States. At December 31, 2011, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was the
Company s principal subsidiary with assets of $1.2 trillion, or 88% of the Company s assets.      At December 31,
2011, we had 264,200 active, full-time equivalent team members.      Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, are available free at  www.wellsfargo.com/invest_relations/filings  as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are also available free on the SEC s website at  www.sec.gov .   

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS        General       We are a diversified financial services company. We provide retail, commercial
and corporate banking services through banking stores and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and in other countries. We provide other financial
services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses, principally: wholesale banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing, agricultural finance, commercial finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance
agency and brokerage services, computer and data processing services, trust services, investment advisory services, mortgage-backed securities servicing and venture capital investment.   
  We have three operating segments for management reporting purposes: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth, Brokerage and
Retirement. The 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments.   
   Competition       The financial services
industry is highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, investment banks and mutual
fund companies. They also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses, as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory
constraints and some may have lower cost structures.      Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial
holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more
competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds
between parties.   

1   

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION       We describe below, and in Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders, the
material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, and a change in them, including
changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers and the
banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the Company.      Statutes,
regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services, acquire depository institutions, and pay dividends on our capital stock. They may also require us to provide financial support to one or more of
our subsidiary banks, maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions. See the  Risk
Factors  section in the 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information.       General    
   Parent Bank Holding Company.  As a bank holding company, the Parent is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and
supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies.   
   Subsidiary Banks.  Our subsidiary national banks, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FRB. The foreign branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their
respective foreign financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Foreign subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they conduct business. Our state-chartered
banks are subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the FDIC and, in addition, are regulated and examined by their respective state banking departments.       Nonbank Subsidiaries.  Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject

to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and,
in some cases, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the various states as well as foreign countries in
which they conduct business.       Parent Bank Holding Company Activities         Financial in Nature  Requirement.  We became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our status as a bank holding company for purposes of other
FRB regulations. As a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or
incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature.  Financial in nature  activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting
and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity.  Complementary activities  are activities
that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk.      FRB approval is not generally required for us to acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to
activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is required before we may
acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings association. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(Dodd-Frank Act) also prohibits our ability to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control of another company if our total resulting consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities
of all financial companies.      Because we are a financial holding company, if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating
under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better, from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding
companies, banks or savings associations, except that we could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities, that are closely related to banking under the BHC Act. In addition, if the FRB finds that any one of our subsidiary
banks is not well capitalized or well managed, we would be required to enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until
corrected, we could be   

2   

prohibited from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the BHC Act without prior FRB approval. If we fail to
correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or, in the alternative, to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the BHC Act.   
   Interstate Banking.  Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act), a bank holding company may acquire banks in
states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or
following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company s initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such
deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state).      The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to
merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states where authorized under the laws of those states.   
   Regulatory Approval.  In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors,
the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and
regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution s record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the
risk to the stability of the United States banking system.       Dividend Restrictions    
  The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A significant source of funds to pay dividends on
our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent s subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent s subsidiary banks
and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Parent s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The
payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Parent s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further,
influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent s subsidiary banks, see Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2011
Annual Report to Stockholders.   
 
   In addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends
to us, the FRB finalized rules in late December 2011 that require large bank holding companies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions, such as the payment
of dividends. In late 2011 the FRB also proposed additional regulations that would restrict or prohibit our ability to pay dividends upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management triggers.   
   Holding Company Structure        Transfer
of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.  The Parent s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries
(including affiliates) in so-called  covered transactions.  In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of
value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus and,
with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank s capital and surplus. Also, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by qualifying collateral. A
bank s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm s length terms.       Source of Strength.
 The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may
be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.      The OCC may order an assessment of the
Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent s stock in the national bank to cover the
deficiency.      Capital loans by the Parent to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and
certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, in the event of the Parent s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Parent to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.       Depositor Preference.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) provides
that, in the event of the  liquidation or other resolution  of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for
administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have   

3   

priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in
payment ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the Parent, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.       Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.  All of the Company s subsidiary banks are insured by the FDIC. FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or
reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution that is
in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company.  Default  means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver.  In danger of default  means generally the existence of certain conditions
indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.       Dodd-Frank Act    
  The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, will result in broad changes to the U.S. financial system and is the most significant financial reform
legislation since the 1930s. Although a number of its provisions are effective, many of these provisions require the issuance of rules or other agency guidance which remain open to public comment and are not final. As a result, much of the impact of
the Dodd-Frank Act is not yet known, but we anticipate the Dodd-Frank Act will affect most of our businesses in some way, either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks, capital or
liquidity. At the enterprise level, the FRB recently proposed rules to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding enhanced supervision and regulation of large BHCs like Wells Fargo and other systemically significant firms. The proposed
rules include new risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, counterparty credit exposure limits, risk management requirements, stress testing requirements, debt-to-equity requirements, and early remediation
requirements. The FRB published the proposed rules in December 2011. Until the proposed rules are final, we are unable to accurately estimate their impact on the Company, but we expect the final rules will significantly increase our compliance and
regulatory requirements.      In addition to proposing rules in 2011 for the enhanced supervision and regulation of large BHCs
and other systemically significant firms, federal financial regulators also implemented rules to facilitate the resolution of financial companies. At the end of 2011, the FDIC and FRB finalized regulations requiring large BHCs like Wells Fargo to
prepare and periodically revise resolution plans in the event of material distress or failure. The FDIC also finalized rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act authorizing it to resolve some financial companies and, under its authority as
the agency responsible for insuring deposits with banks, the FDIC implemented rules requiring large

banks to prepare resolution plans. The FDIC also implemented rules shifting the basis for calculating FDIC assessments from deposits to assets and imposing a separate risk-based assessment on
large banks.      During 2011, the FRB finalized rules implementing other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including for the
regulation of interchange fees (the Durbin Amendment) and for the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business checking accounts. The final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment establish a maximum fee that we may generally
receive for electronic debit transactions, and the repeal of the prohibition on payment of interest on business checking accounts required changes to our affected products.      Federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other rulemakings in 2011 to implement various other requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, but many of these other proposed rules remain open for comment.
Agencies have proposed rules establishing a comprehensive framework for the regulation of derivatives, prohibiting banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning interests in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds (the
Volcker Rule), and requiring sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain an ownership stake in the ABS. Although we have analyzed these and other proposed rules, the absence of final rules and the complexity of some of the proposed rules
make it difficult for the Company to estimate the financial, compliance or operational impacts.      The Dodd-Frank Act also
established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices. The CFPB has begun
exercising supervisory review of banks under its jurisdiction and is expected to focus its rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage-related topics, such as the steering of consumers toward certain products, abusive or unfair lending practices,
disclosure requirements, mortgage underwriting standards and mortgage servicing standards. Proposed regulations have been issued on several topics, including minimum mortgage underwriting standards; however, the content of final rules and impacts to
our businesses are uncertain at this time.       Capital Requirements       We are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, which are substantially similar to those imposed by the OCC and the FDIC on depository institutions within their
jurisdictions. Under these guidelines, a depository institution s or a holding company s assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories. Tier 1 capital is considered core
capital and generally includes common stockholders  equity, qualifying preferred stock, and trust preferred securities, and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, reduced by goodwill, net of related taxes, certain intangible and
other assets in excess of prescribed limitations, and adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included in other comprehensive income. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt and other components that do not qualify for

4   

Tier 1 capital, and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a specified percentage of risk-weighted assets. In addition to measures of Tier 1 and Total capital, a further measure of
capital, Tier 1 common capital, reflects common equity and retained earnings, less goodwill and certain other deductions.   
  During 2011, we redeemed $9.2 billion of our trust preferred securities as a result of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the
Collins Amendment that phases out trust preferred securities from the calculation of Tier 1 capital. We will be required to phase existing trust preferred securities out of Tier 1 capital over three years beginning January 1, 2013. We
expect proposed rules implementing the Collins Amendment to provide additional clarity regarding the timing of the phase out.   
  National banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain Tier 1 and Total capital equal to at least 4% and 8%,
respectively, of their total risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit). The risk-based capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad
credit-risk considerations and do not take into account the other types of risk a banking organization may be exposed to (e.g., interest rate, market, liquidity and operational risks). The FRB may, therefore, set higher capital requirements for
categories of banks (e.g. systematically important firms), or for an individual bank as situations warrant. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions
substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. For these reasons, we are expected to operate with a capital position well above the minimum ratios, with the amount of capital held to be
determined by us through an internal capital assessment that corresponds to our broad risk exposure.      The regulatory capital
rules state that voting common stockholders  equity should be the dominant element within Tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on non-common equity elements. During 2009, in conjunction with the FRB s
SCAP stress test process, the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in Tier 1 capital. There is currently no mandated minimum ratio.   
  In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital
that are designed to be more risk sensitive than the existing framework and to promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. The United States federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a
final rule similar to the international guidelines in November 2007. This advanced capital adequacy framework is known as  Basel II,  and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks. Basel II
incorporates three pillars that address (a) capital adequacy, (b) supervisory review, which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes, and (c) market discipline, through increased disclosure requirements.
Embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy, measurement and management that relate to credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Banking organizations

are required to enhance the measurement and management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating risk-based capital requirements. Basel II includes safeguards that
include a requirement that banking organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general risk-based capital rules
before solely operating under the Basel II framework; a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under Basel II without floors; and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies
to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure Basel II is working as intended. However, the federal bank regulators adopted a final rule in 2011 to replace the transitional floors in the advanced approaches with a permanent capital floor
equal to the risk-based capital requirements under the Basel I capital adequacy guidelines. Wells Fargo is implementing the advanced approach under Basel II, and has established a project management infrastructure to implement the regulations and
enter the parallel run in 2012 with regulatory approval. Our delayed entry into the parallel run phase was approved by the FRB in 2010 as a result of our acquisition of Wachovia.   
  In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage (Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets)
guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banks that meet certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and
the highest regulatory rating. Institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4%. Our Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio as of December 31, 2011, are included in Note 26
(Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders. At December 31, 2011, the Company and each of its subsidiary banks were  well capitalized  under the
applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines.      In December 2010, the BCBS finalized a set of international guidelines
for determining regulatory capital known as  Basel III.  These guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and address many of the weaknesses identified in the banking sector as contributing to the crisis
including excessive leverage, inadequate and low quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers. Basel III fundamentals:   

raise the quality of capital for banks to be better able to absorb losses on both a going concern and gone concern basis;      

increase the risk coverage of the capital framework, specifically for trading activities, securitizations, exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles, and
counterparty credit exposures arising from derivatives;      

5   

raise the level of minimum capital requirements;      

establish an international leverage ratio;      

develop capital buffers; and      

raise standards for the supervisory review process (Pillar 2) and public disclosures (Pillar 3).      
  The U.S. regulatory bodies are reviewing the final international standards and final U.S. rulemaking is expected to be completed in 2012.   
  The BCBS proposed additional Tier 1 common equity surcharge requirements for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The surcharge
ranges from 1.0% to 3.5% depending on the bank s systemic importance to be determined under an indicator-based approach that would consider five broad categories: cross-jurisdictional activity, size, inter-connectedness,
substitutability/financial institution infrastructure and complexity. These additional capital requirements, which would be phased in beginning in January 2016 and become fully effective on January 1, 2019, would be in addition to the minimum
Basel III 7.0% Tier 1 common equity requirement finalized in December 2010. The Financial Stability Board has determined that the Company is one of the initial 29 G-SIBs that would be subject to the surcharge, but has not yet determined the
surcharge amount for us and the other banks.      In December 2011, the FRB issued proposed rules requiring large BHCs like Wells
Fargo to submit annual capital plans demonstrating their ability to maintain capital above existing minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a Tier 1 common ratio of 5% under both expected and stressed conditions over at least a nine-quarter
period. The proposed rule did not include Basel III capital requirements or a surcharge for G-SIBs. The FRB, however, did indicate it is continuing to implement Basel III capital reforms and expects to adopt rules in 2014 that will implement a G-SIB
surcharge consistent with the BCBS approach.      Although uncertainty exists regarding final capital rules, including the
FRB s approach to capital requirements, we evaluate the impact of Basel III on our capital ratios based on our interpretation of the proposed capital requirements and we estimate that our Tier 1 common equity ratio under the Basel III proposal
exceeded the fully phased-in minimum of 7.0% by 50 basis points at the end of 2011. This estimate is subject to change depending on final promulgation of Basel III capital rulemaking and interpretations thereof by regulatory authorities.   
  From time to time, the FRB and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) propose changes and amendments to, and
issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and related reporting instructions. In addition, the FRB has closely monitored capital levels of the institutions it supervises during the ongoing financial disruption, and may require such
institutions to modify capital levels based on FRB determinations. Such determinations, proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.   
  As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the FDI Act requires federal bank
regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital

safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate
exposure, executive compensation and risk management. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.      The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take  prompt corrective action  with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A
depository institution s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.   
   Capital Planning       In connection with
its increased focus on the adequacy of regulatory capital and risk management for large financial firms, the FRB required large banks to submit a capital plan in early 2011 as part of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). Following
submission of our capital plan on January 7, 2011, the FRB notified us on March 18, 2011, that it did not object to our 2011 capital plan. Since that notification, the Company took several capital actions in 2011, including increasing the
quarterly common stock dividend to $0.12 a share, repurchasing $2.4 billion of our common stock, and redeeming $9.2 billion of trust preferred securities that will no longer count as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposed Basel III
capital standards.      In late 2011, the FRB finalized rules to require large BHCs to submit capital plans annually and to
obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions. The rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a BHC s risk profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions.   
  Under the FRB s new capital plan rule, 2012 CCAR will include a BHC s comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of
expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios, similar to the process the FRB relied upon to conduct the 2011 CCAR. As part of the 2012 CCAR, the FRB will also generate a
supervisory stress test driven by a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the BHC to estimate performance. The FRB has indicated it will publish its estimates of performance under
this scenario on a BHC-specific basis. We submitted our board-approved 2012 capital plan to the FRB on January 6, 2012. We expect the FRB s response to our submission in March 2012.       Deposit Insurance Assessments       Our bank subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
are members of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The DIF was formed March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the Bank
Insurance Fund and the Savings Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the FDIR Act). The FDIR Act established a range of 1.15% to 1.50% within which

6   

the FDIC board of directors may set the Designated Reserve Ratio (reserve ratio or DRR). The FDIR Act also granted the FDIC Board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for
all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio.      The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC greater discretion
to manage the DIF, raised the minimum DRR to 1.35% and removed the upper limit of the range. In October 2010, the FDIC Board adopted a Restoration Plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the
Dodd-Frank Act. At the same time, the FDIC Board proposed a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management. In December 2010, as part of the comprehensive plan, the FDIC Board adopted a final rule to set the DRR at 2%, and in February 2011,
the FDIC Board approved the remainder of the comprehensive plan. The Restoration Plan eliminated a 3 basis point increase in the annual assessment rates that was to take effect January 1, 2011.   
  In 2009, the FDIC undertook several measures in an effort to replenish the DIF. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final
rule modifying the risk-based assessment system and set new initial base assessment rates beginning April 1, 2009. Rates ranged from a minimum of 12 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for well-managed, well-capitalized institutions with the
highest credit ratings, to 45 cents per $100 for those institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. Risk-based adjustments to the initial assessment rate could have lowered the rate to 7 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for well-managed,
well-capitalized banks with the highest credit ratings or raised the rate to 77.5 cents per $100 for depository institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special
assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. The amount of the special assessment for any institution was limited to 10 basis points times the institution s assessment base
for the second quarter 2009. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC amended its regulations to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for fourth quarter 2009, and all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. For
purposes of determining the prepayment, the FDIC used the institution s assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009. The combined prepayment amount for our banking subsidiaries was $3.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion remains available
to offset future assessments.      On February 7, 2011, the FDIC Board approved a final rule on assessments, dividends,
assessment base and large bank pricing that took effect on April 1, 2011. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate. Generally, the assessment base is an
institution s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. For large and highly complex institutions (those that are very large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in the
case of failure), the assessment rate is determined by combining supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into scorecards. The score received by an institution will be converted into an assessment rate for the institution. The FDIC retains
the ability to adjust the total score

of large and highly complex institutions based upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards.   
  All FDIC-insured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing
Corporation, a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO bonds) were issued to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FDIC-insured
depository institutions paid approximately 1.00 to 1.02 cents per $100 of assessable deposits during the first nine months of 2011. To coincide with Dodd-Frank Act mandated changes to the insurance assessment base, the FDIC established lower FICO
assessment rates, .68 cents per $100 of assessment base for the fourth quarter of 2011 and .66 cents per $100 of assessment base for first quarter 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company s FDIC deposit insurance
assessments, including FICO assessments, totaled $1.3 billion.      The FDIC may terminate a depository institution s
deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or
imposed by the institution s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular banks
involved.       Fiscal and Monetary Policies       Our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which
regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government securities, (b) changing the discount rates
of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions  deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their
affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.       Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Restrictions
on Cross-Selling       Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the
ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent
disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information

7   

is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit
Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of cross-selling
products and services between those affiliated companies.       Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002    
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate
responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. We are subject
to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its implementing regulations established membership requirements and additional
responsibilities for our audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed additional responsibilities
for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders, required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our
internal control over financial reporting, and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting.   
   Patriot Act       The Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to
combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Patriot Act has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act required us to implement new or revised
policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of
an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.       Future Legislation or Regulation
      In light of recent conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets and the U.S. and global economy, legislators, the presidential
administration and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the financial services industry. Proposals that further increase regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be

introduced in the U.S. Congress in state legislatures and abroad. Only a small percentage of the regulations authorized or required under the Dodd-Frank Act have been proposed or finalized by
federal regulators. Further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, affect our
compensation structure, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether future legislative proposals will be
enacted and, if enacted, the effect that they, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or required under the
Dodd-Frank Act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized.       ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   MARKET INFORMATION       The Company s
common stock is listed on the NYSE (symbol  WFC ). The Quarterly Financial Data table of the 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders provides the quarterly prices of, and quarterly dividends paid on, the Company s common stock for the
two-year period ended December 31, 2011, and is incorporated herein by reference. Prices shown represent the daily high and low, and the quarter-end sale prices of the Company s common stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
Transaction Reporting System for the periods indicated. At January 31, 2012, there were 200,518 holders of record of the Company s common stock.       DIVIDENDS       The dividend restrictions discussions on page 3 of this report and in the 2011
Annual Report to Stockholders under  Financial Statements   Notes to Financial Statements   Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions)  are incorporated into this item by reference.

REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES       In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 25 million shares of our common stock and in March 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional
200 million shares of our common stock. The authorization covered shares repurchased to meet team member benefit plan requirements. The Company maintains a variety of retirement plans for its team members and typically is a net issuer of shares
of common stock to these plans. From time to time, it also purchases shares of common stock from these plans to accommodate team member preferences. Share repurchases are subtracted from the Company s repurchase authority without offset for
share issuances. Shares may be repurchased as part of employee stock option exercises, from the different benefit plans or in the open market, subject to regulatory approval.      The amount and timing of stock repurchases will be based on various factors, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market
conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. In June 2010, our Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of warrants to purchase our common stock. The warrants are listed
on the NYSE under the symbol  WFCWS.  The amount and timing of warrant repurchases will be based on various factors including market conditions. See the  Capital Management  section in the 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders for
additional information about our common stock and warrant repurchases.

   EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION

The following table provides information about our equity compensation plans in effect on December 31,
2011, separately aggregated for plans approved by stockholders and for plans not approved by stockholders. A description of the material features of each equity compensation plan not approved by stockholders follows the table. All outstanding awards
relate to shares of our common stock. Information is as of December 31, 2011, unless otherwise indicated.   

Equity Compensation Plan Information  (1)

(1)  
  The table above does not include information about equity compensation plans assumed in mergers that we froze at the time of the merger. Under these assumed plans a total of
6,646,893 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of options and 23,438 shares upon distribution of vested but deferred share-based awards. The weighted average exercise price per share of our common stock of the outstanding options was
$121.58. We assumed the amended and restated Wachovia Corporation 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (2003 SIP) in the Wachovia merger and in February 2009 used substantially all remaining available shares for stock option grants to legacy Wachovia team
members. Information for the 2003 SIP is included in the table above under the plan category for equity compensation plans not approved by security holders. No awards have been granted since February 2009, and no future awards will be granted under
the 2003 SIP.     

(2)  
  Does not reflect restricted share rights (RSRs), restricted share units (RSUs), or restricted share awards (RSAs) or deferred compensation benefits because they have no exercise
price.     

(4)  
  We could have issued the number of shares of our common stock indicated in the following table pursuant to any of the award types listed for the plan or, if indicated for the
plan, pursuant to distributions of deferred compensation benefits. Each share of common stock issued under the LTICP pursuant to awards other than options or SARs counts as two shares. Effective January 24, 2012, the Board authorized an additional
500,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Directors Plan for compensation deferrals only.         

(6)  
  We could have issued the number of shares of our common stock indicated in the following table pursuant to any of the award types listed for the plan or, if indicated for the
plan, pursuant to distributions of deferred compensation benefits. No information is provided for the 2003 SIP, PartnerShares Plan, the Norwest Corporation Directors  Formula Stock Award Plan and the Norwest Corporation Directors  Stock
Deferral Plan because no future awards or deferrals will be made under these plans and because column (a) reflects all shares issuable under those plans upon exercise or distribution of outstanding awards or deferred compensation benefits.

Material Features of Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Stockholders    
    The 2003 SIP  . The amended and restated Wachovia Corporation 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (2003 SIP) was originally approved by Wachovia s
shareholders in 2003 and prior to the merger had been used for equity awards to Wachovia s executive officers and other key employees. We assumed the 2003 SIP in the merger and in February 2009 used substantially all remaining available shares
for stock option grants to legacy Wachovia team members. No awards have been granted since then, and no future awards will be granted under the 2003 SIP.      At December 31, 2011, only options and stock awards in the form of RSAs were outstanding under the 2003 SIP. The options generally expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date and vest ratably
over a three-year period from the grant date. The option price is payable to us in full by methods the Board s Human Resources Committee (HRC) designates, including, but not limited to, in cash or its equivalent, by tendering or withholding
shares of our common stock having a fair market value at the time of exercise equal to the total option price, or by a combination of the foregoing. Unless the HRC determines otherwise or except as prohibited by applicable law, options may also be
exercised by a  cashless exercise  where the participant gives irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to us the amount of sale proceeds from the shares covered by the option exercised, together with any withholding taxes
due to the Company. The proceeds from any cash payments upon option exercise are added to our general funds and used for general corporate purposes. The outstanding RSAs vest upon the achievement of the specified performance criteria. Prior to
vesting, the holders of RSAs may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares and are entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to those shares. Each participant s award agreement will state the
extent, if any, to which the participant may receive unvested stock awards following termination of employment.        PartnerShares
Plan  . We used the PartnerShares Stock Option Plan (PartnerShares) from 1996-2002 primarily for equity awards to team members not eligible for grants under the LTICP. The plan was in effect at December 31, 2011, only as to the issuance
of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options. No future awards may be granted under the PartnerShares Plan.      Options under the
PartnerShares Plan are exercisable at the closing share price of our common stock as of the trading day immediately before the grant date. All options granted under the plan were vested at December 31, 2011. Options are exercisable for ten
years from the grant date or one year from the participant s death, whichever occurs first. If a participant leaves the Company other than because of death, permanent disability or discharge for cause, the option terminates immediately or three
months after termination, as specified in

the grant terms. If a participant is discharged for cause, the option terminates immediately. Participants can pay the exercise price in cash or by cashless exercise through a broker.   
    Deferred Compensation Plan  . Under the Deferred Compensation Plan eligible team members may defer receipt of salary, bonuses and certain
other compensation subject to the terms of the plan. Deferral elections are irrevocable once made except for limited re-deferral opportunities. We treat amounts deferred by a participant as if invested in the earnings options selected by the
participant, and determine the deferred compensation benefit payable to the participant based on the performance of those earnings options. The plan offers a number of earnings options, including one based on our common stock with dividends
reinvested. We generally distribute amounts allocated to the common stock option in shares of common stock. Participants have no direct interest in any of the earnings options and are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to their
deferred compensation benefits under the plan.        Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors  . Under the
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors participants who perform qualifying investment or other financial services for participating affiliates as independent contractors may defer all or part of their eligible
compensation payable to them by the affiliate subject to the terms of the plan. Deferral elections are irrevocable once made. Amounts deferred by a participant are treated as if invested in the earnings options selected by the participant, which
determine the deferred compensation benefit payable to the participant. The plan offers a number of earnings options, including one based on our common stock with dividends reinvested. We generally distribute amounts allocated to the common stock
option in shares of common stock. The plan is sponsored by a wholly owned subsidiary, WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. We have guaranteed its obligations under the plan. Participants have no direct interest in any of the earnings options and
are general unsecured creditors of the plan sponsor and the Company with respect to their deferred compensation benefits under the plan.   
    Norwest Corporation Directors  Formula Stock Award Plan  . Under the Norwest Corporation Directors  Formula Stock Award Plan we
awarded shares of common stock to non-employee directors. The plan allowed participants to defer receipt of all or a portion of their awards, with dividends reinvested, until a future year or years as selected by the participants subject to the
terms of the plan. Participants can elect one time to defer commencement of distribution of their deferral accounts if the election is made sufficiently in advance of the original distribution commencement date and the new distribution commencement
date is sufficiently beyond the original distribution commencement date. Participants have no direct interest in the shares deferred under the plan and are general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to payment of their deferred stock
awards under the plan. No future stock awards or deferrals may be made under this plan.   

17   

Norwest Corporation Directors  Stock Deferral Plan  . Under the Norwest Corporation
Directors  Stock Deferral Plan a participating director could defer receipt of all or part of the annual cash retainer and meeting fees payable to the director until a future year or years as selected by the director subject to the terms of the
plan. A participating director could elect distribution of his or her deferral account in a lump sum in either cash or whole shares of common stock, or a combination of both. Alternatively, the director could elect to receive the distribution in up
to ten annual installments of cash. A participant can elect one time to defer commencement of distribution of his or her deferral account if the election is made sufficiently in advance of the original distribution commencement date and the new
distribution commencement date is sufficiently beyond the original distribution commencement date. No future deferrals may be made under this plan.       ADDITIONAL INFORMATION       Additional information in response to this Item 12 can be

     2. Authority is hereby expressly granted to and vested in the Board of Directors at any time or from time to time to issue
the Preferred Stock as Preferred Stock of any series and the Preference Stock as Preference Stock of any series and, in connection with the creation of each such series, to fix by resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of shares thereof
the designations and the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series so far as not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Article FOURTH applicable to all series of Preferred Stock or Preference Stock, respectively, and to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, including the following:   
  (a) The distinctive designation of such series and the number of shares which shall constitute such series, which number
may be increased (except where otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in creating such series) or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) from time to time by like action of the Board of Directors;   
  (b) The annual rate or rates of dividends payable on shares of such series, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if
so, the date or dates from which dividends shall be cumulative on the shares of such series, the preferences, restrictions, limitations and conditions upon the payment of dividends, and the dates on which dividends, if declared, shall be payable;
     (c) Whether shares of such series shall be redeemable and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption,
including the date or dates upon or after which they shall be redeemable, and the amount per share payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under different conditions and at different redemption dates;   
  (d) The rights of the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of such series;      (e)
Whether shares of such series shall have a purchase, retirement or sinking fund for the purchase, retirement, or redemption of shares of such series and, if so, the terms and provisions thereof;   
         -3-

(f) Whether shares of such series shall have conversion privileges and, if
so, the terms and provisions thereof, including provision for adjustment of the conversion rate in such events as the Board of Directors shall determine;      (g) Whether shares of such series shall have voting rights, in addition to voting rights provided by law, and, if so, the terms and provisions thereof; and   
  (h) Any other preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereof.      3. The holders of the Preferred Stock of each series and the holders of the Preference Stock of each
series, respectively, shall be entitled to receive such dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor, as they may be entitled to in accordance with the resolution or resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series, payable on such dates as may be fixed in such resolution or resolutions. So long as there shall be outstanding any shares of Preferred Stock of any series or any shares of Preference Stock
of any series entitled to cumulative dividends pursuant to the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such series, no dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared, nor shall any distribution be made, on the Common
Stock, nor shall any shares of Common Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for value by the corporation, if at the time of making such payment, declaration, distribution, purchase, redemption or acquisition the corporation shall be in
default with respect to any dividend payable on, or obligation to maintain a purchase, retirement or sinking fund with respect to or to redeem, shares of Preferred Stock of any series or shares of Preference Stock of any series. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 3 shall not, however, apply to a dividend payable in Common Stock or to the acquisition of shares of Common Stock in exchange for, or through application of the proceeds of the sale of, shares of Common Stock.
     Subject to the foregoing and to any further limitations prescribed in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of
this Article FOURTH, the Board of Directors may declare, out of any funds legally available therefor, dividends upon the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, and shares of Preferred Stock of any series and shares of Preference Stock of any
series shall not be entitled to participate therein.      4. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the corporation, the holders of the Preferred Stock of each series and the holders of the Preference Stock of each series shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the corporation available for distribution to its
stockholders, before any distribution of assets shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock, the amount per share fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2 of this Article FOURTH, plus in each such case an amount equal to any
cumulative dividends thereon to the date of final distribution to the holders of the Preferred Stock or to the holders of the Preference Stock, respectively; and the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled, to the exclusion of the holders of
the Preferred Stock of any and all series and the holders of the Preference Stock of any and all series, respectively, to participate ratably in all the assets of the corporation then remaining in accordance with their respective rights and
preferences. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation the assets available for distribution shall be insufficient to pay the holders of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or the holders of all outstanding shares
of Preference Stock the full amounts to which they respectively shall be entitled, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock of all series and the holders of shares of Preference Stock of all series, respectively, shall participate ratably in any
distribution of assets according to the respective amounts which would be payable in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock or shares of Preference Stock held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable in respect of the Preferred Stock
of all series or the Preference Stock of all series, respectively, were paid in full. Neither the statutory merger nor consolidation of the corporation into or with any other corporation, nor the statutory merger or consolidation of any other
  
         -4-

corporation into or with the corporation, nor a sale, transfer or lease of all or any part of the assets of the corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
corporation within the meaning of this Section 4.      5. The corporation, at the option of the Board of Directors, may
redeem the whole or any part of the Preferred Stock of any series or of the Preference Stock of any series at the price or prices and on the terms and conditions provided in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing
for the issue of such series.      6. Anything herein or in any resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors
providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock or any series of Preference Stock contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights of the holders of all classes of stock of the corporation in respect of dividends and purchase,
retirement or sinking funds, if any, shall at all times be subject to the power of the Board of Directors from time to time to set aside such reserves and to make such other provisions, if any, as the Board of Directors shall deem to be necessary or
advisable for working capital, for expansion of the corporation s business (including the acquisition of real and personal property for that purpose) and for any other purpose of the corporation.   
  7. Except as otherwise provided by the statutes of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by the resolution or
resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock or any series of Preference Stock, the holders of the Preferred Stock and the holders of the Preference Stock shall have no right to vote. The
holders of the Preferred Stock and the holders of the Preference Stock shall not be entitled to receive notice of any meeting of stockholders at which they are not entitled to vote or consent. The holders of shares of Preference Stock shall not be
entitled to more than one vote per share.      8. Except as otherwise provided by the statutes of the State of Delaware or by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of any series of Preferred Stock or any series of Preference Stock, the vote of the holders of all or any portion of any class
of stock, as a class, shall not be required for any action whatsoever to be taken or authorized by the stockholders of the corporation, including any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation.   
  9. No holder of shares of the corporation of any class or of any security or obligation convertible into, or of any warrant, option or
right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire, shares of the corporation of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized, shall, as such holder, have any preemptive right whatsoever to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of
the corporation of any class or any security or obligation convertible into, or any warrant, option or right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire, shares of the corporation of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized.   
  10. If it deems it desirable so to do, the Board of Directors may from time to time issue scrip for fractional shares of stock. Such
scrip shall not confer upon the holder any voting or other rights of a stockholder of the corporation, but the corporation shall from time to time, within such time as the Board of Directors may determine, issue one whole share of stock upon the
surrender of scrip for fractional shares aggregating one whole share, properly endorsed if in registered form.      Pursuant to
the authority conferred by this Article FOURTH, the following series of Preferred Stock have been designated, each such series consisting of such number of shares, with such voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating,

expressly authorized:      To make, alter, amend or repeal the By-Laws of the corporation, except as otherwise provided in said

any Director or officer of this corporation is a party to or interested in such contract or transaction in any way connected with such person or persons, firm, association or corporation; provided that such contract or other transaction shall be
authorized or ratified by the vote of a majority of the Directors of this corporation not so interested; and each and every person who may become a Director or officer of this corporation is hereby relieved from any liability that might otherwise

thereof and any of said types of plans enumerated in clause (ii) of this Article THIRTEENTH benefiting any or all officers and employees thereof.

is a salaried officer of the corporation or of any affiliated bank or company.      FOURTEENTH: (a)  Elimination of Certain
Liability of Directors . A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the
director s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.   
  (b)(1)  Right to Indemnification . Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be a made a party to or is
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a  proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a
director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or inaction in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent,
shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys  fees, judgments, fines, ERISA
excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee
or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in subparagraph (b)(2), the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with
a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this paragraph (b) shall be a contract
right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, the payment of
such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to
an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this paragraph (b) or otherwise. The corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.   
         -8-

(2)  Right of Claimant to Bring Suit . If a claim under subparagraph (b)(1) is not paid
in full by the corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or
in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of
its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the
corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General
Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.      (3)  Non-Exclusivity of Rights .
The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this paragraph (b) shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.      (4)  Insurance . The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation is executed on behalf of the corporation
by its Chairman and attested by its Secretary this
 28  th       day of September, 2006.

       WELLS
FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee I of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation
Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at a meeting of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000, and by the ESOP Committee pursuant to the written consent of the
ESOP Committee duly adopted on March 12, 2003, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1.
On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in
all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:   
  RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred Stock
Committee I (the  First Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of Company
common stock ($1-2/3 par value) issuable upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock, and in connection therewith, to fix the designations, voting powers, preferences, and all other rights, qualifications and restrictions of such ESOP Preferred Stock,
to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the First Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the First Committee shall deem necessary or
appropriate.      RESOLVED that Richard M. Kovacevich is designated to serve as the sole member of the First Committee until his
successor is duly elected and qualified.      * * * *      RESOLVED that any series of ESOP Preferred Stock authorized for issuance by the First Committee . . . shall have the voting rights set forth in Appendix A to these resolutions.   
         G-1

APPENDIX A - VOTING RIGHTS   
  No series of the Preferred Stock, except as hereinafter set forth in this resolution or as otherwise from time to time required by law,
shall have voting rights. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on any shares of a designated series of the Preferred Stock (such shares of such designated series of Preferred Stock being hereinafter referred to as the  Shares of
such series ) shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class
with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Shares of such series, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each
holder of the Shares of such series shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred
Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the
holders of such outstanding Shares of such series (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein
set forth. The right of such holders of such Shares of such series (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been
conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such Shares of such series shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such Shares of
such series shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.   
  Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the
term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.
Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as
may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      So long as any Shares of such series remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a
parity with such Shares of such series either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of
all such outstanding Shares of such series and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit,
effect or validate any one or more of the following:      (a) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any
increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to the Shares of such series with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
         G-2

(b) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designation for the Shares of such series designating the Shares of such series and the preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Shares of such series or of the holders
thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each
case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Shares of such series with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.      The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Shares of such series shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  2. On March 12, 2003, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in the ESOP Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted
the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED
that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:      2003 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and
Number of Shares; Restricted Issue.       (a) The designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided
for herein shall be  2003 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2003 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of authorized shares constituting the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock is 260,200, based
on an offering price for the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,071.40 per share. Each share of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share. The number of authorized shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by
further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized,
provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided further that the number of authorized shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock
shall not be increased. All shares of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without
designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock.   
         G-3

(b) Shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the
 Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan (the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company
with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any
successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par
value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4
hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to
the Common Stock into which such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the transferee of the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such transfer. Shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option.
Certificates representing shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of uncertificated 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the
foregoing provisions on each 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing
that the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of
Common Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion
may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.   
  2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time
to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2, as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times,
dividends payable on shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased
by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of
  
         G-4

shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as
aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except
as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by
such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the
remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by
such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company
irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      (c) So long as any shares of 2003 ESOP
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock
either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP
Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one
or more of the following:      (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued
amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
  (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the
amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares
of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers.      (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to

3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $85.00 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base
Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend
shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2004 and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2012, as follows:      (1) If the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a
Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2003 ESOP Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $90.00 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day
if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $95.00 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to
the Base Dividend.        Dividend Adjustment Table     
   
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2006, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $70.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$90.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $90.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2007. If on November 30, 2007, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $100.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock   
         G-6

would equal $95.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $95.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2008. If on November 30, 2008, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock
is $70.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $85.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $85.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2009.
     (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted Dividend  and  Second
Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading Day  shall have the meaning
given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared
with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.   
  (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base Dividend or to an
Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2003. Dividends on shares of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock will be cumulative from the
date of initial issuance of such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days
preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted
Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.      (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any stock of the Company ranking,
as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set
apart for such payment on shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of
2003 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on
a parity as to dividends with 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the
same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable
in cash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on 2003 ESOP
Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.      (ii) So long as any shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock are outstanding, no
dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants, or rights to   
         G-7

subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or any other stock ranking junior to 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i)
of this Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for
any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Company ranking junior to 2003 ESOP Preferred
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment of the then current dividend payment
period and all past dividend payment periods.      4.  Conversion . Shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock are
convertible from time to time hereafter pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 4 into that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the stated value of each share of 2003 ESOP Preferred
Stock by the then applicable Conversion Price, (as determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(iii) of this Section 4), as follows:      (a) Each share of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock released from the unallocated reserve of the Plan in accordance with the terms thereof shall be automatically converted, without any further action by the

(f) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock made pursuant to this Section 4 shall be effective

     (j) The Company will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the

to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.   
  5.  Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price per share of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for

Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (c) of this Section 5. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock called for redemption will
cease to accrue and all rights in respect of such shares of the Company shall cease, except the right to receive the redemption price. Upon payment of the redemption price, such shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Company, to be
retired as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 1. If the full cumulative dividends have not been paid, or contemporaneously declared and set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company may not
redeem fewer than all the outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.      (b) Unless
otherwise required by law, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 will be sent to the holders of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock by
hand delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class mail (postage prepaid) delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may be, not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption
date. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) whether the redemption price shall be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash; (v) in the case of
certificated 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption
date; and (vii) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised and the manner in which the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of 2003 ESOP
Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed for redemption and at the   
         G-11

redemption price set forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of certificated 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the
certificates for the shares to be redeemed are surrendered (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).   
  (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred
Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or
their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2003 ESOP Preferred
Stock then being redeemed.      (d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth
below:      (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the
date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market Value  shall
mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment
Period. The  Fair Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the
security is to be determined, as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market
Value  of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by
the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of
Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock
would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal
(together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2003 ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about March 17, 2003 between the Company and
the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).      6.  Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  (a) If the
Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any
successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2003 ESOP
Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and   
         G-12

shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction,
subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2003 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.      (2) The Company shall
not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.   
  (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares
of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of
qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the
Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock
could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received
in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock could
have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or
amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each
non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.

of such stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without
preference or priority, one over the other, as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock; and      (c) junior to shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall be Common Stock or if the holders of shares of 2003 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be

FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee I of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation
Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at a meeting of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000, and by the ESOP Committee pursuant to the written consent of the
ESOP Committee duly adopted on March 9, 2004, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1.
On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in
all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:   
  RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred Stock
Committee I (the  First Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of Company
common stock ($1-2/3 par value) issuable upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock, and in connection therewith, to fix the designations, voting powers, preferences, and all other rights, qualifications and restrictions of such ESOP Preferred Stock,
to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the First Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the First Committee shall deem necessary or
appropriate.      RESOLVED that Richard M. Kovacevich is designated to serve as the sole member of the First Committee until his
successor is duly elected and qualified.      * * * *      RESOLVED that any series of ESOP Preferred Stock authorized for issuance by the First Committee . . . shall have the voting rights set forth in Appendix A to these resolutions.   
         H-1

APPENDIX A - VOTING RIGHTS   
  No series of the Preferred Stock, except as hereinafter set forth in this resolution or as otherwise from time to time required by law,
shall have voting rights. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on any shares of a designated series of the Preferred Stock (such shares of such designated series of Preferred Stock being hereinafter referred to as the  Shares of
such series ) shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class
with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Shares of such series, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each
holder of the Shares of such series shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred
Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the
holders of such outstanding Shares of such series (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein
set forth. The right of such holders of such Shares of such series (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been
conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such Shares of such series shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such Shares of
such series shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.   
  Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the
term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.
Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as
may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      So long as any Shares of such series remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a
parity with such Shares of such series either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of
all such outstanding Shares of such series and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit,
effect or validate any one or more of the following:      (a) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any
increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to the Shares of such series with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
         H-2

(b) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designation for the Shares of such series designating the Shares of such series and the preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Shares of such series or of the holders
thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each
case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Shares of such series with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.      The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Shares of such series shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  2. On March 9, 2004, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in the ESOP Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted
the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED
that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:      2004 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and
Number of Shares; Restricted Issue .      (a) The designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided
for herein shall be  2004 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2004 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of authorized shares constituting the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock is 321,000, based
on an offering price for the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,071.40 per share. Each share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share. The number of authorized shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by
further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized,
provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided further that the number of authorized shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock
shall not be increased. All shares of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without
designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock.   
         H-3

(b) Shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the
 Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan (the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company
with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any
successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par
value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4
hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to
the Common Stock into which such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the transferee of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such transfer. Shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option.
Certificates representing shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of uncertificated 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the
foregoing provisions on each 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing
that the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of
Common Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion
may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.   
  2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time
to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2, as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times,
dividends payable on shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased
by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of
  
         H-4

shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as
aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except
as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by
such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the
remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by
such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company
irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      (c) So long as any shares of 2004 ESOP
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock
either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP
Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one
or more of the following:      (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued
amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
  (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the
amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares
of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers.      (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to
which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
         H-5

3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $85.00 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base
Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend
shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2005 and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2013, as follows:      (1) If the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a
Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2004 ESOP Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $90.00 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day
if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $95.00 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to
the Base Dividend.        Dividend Adjustment Table     
   
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2007, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $85.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$90.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $90.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2008. If on November 30, 2008, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $115.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock   
         H-6

would equal $95.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $95.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2009. If on November 30, 2009, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock
is $85.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $85.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $85.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2010.
     (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted Dividend  and  Second
Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading Day  shall have the meaning
given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared
with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.   
  (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base Dividend or to an
Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2004. Dividends on shares of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock will be cumulative from the
date of initial issuance of such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days
preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted
Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.      (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any stock of the Company ranking,

same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable
in cash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on 2004 ESOP

     (j) The Company will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the

issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock to be converted and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid
to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.   
  5.  Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price per share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for
redemption, and (y) the Fair Market Value (as that term is defined in paragraph (d) of this Section 5) per share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock on the date fixed for redemption. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the
Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (c) of this Section 5. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock called for redemption will
cease to accrue and all rights in respect of such shares of the Company shall cease, except the right to receive the redemption price. Upon payment of the redemption price, such shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Company, to be
retired as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 1. If the full cumulative dividends have not been paid, or contemporaneously declared and set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company may not
redeem fewer than all the outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.      (b) Unless
otherwise required by law, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 will be sent to the holders of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock by
hand delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class mail (postage prepaid) delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may be, not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption
date. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) whether the redemption price shall be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash; (v) in the case of
certificated 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption
date; and (vii) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised and the manner in which the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of 2004 ESOP
Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed for redemption and at the   
         H-11

redemption price set forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of certificated 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the
certificates for the shares to be redeemed are surrendered (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).   
  (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred
Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or
their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2004 ESOP Preferred
Stock then being redeemed.      (d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth
below:      (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the
date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market Value  shall
mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment
Period. The  Fair Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the
security is to be determined, as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market
Value  of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by
the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of
Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock
would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal
(together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2004 ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about March 12, 2004 between the Company and
the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).      6.  Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  (a) If the
Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any
successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2004 ESOP
Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and   
         H-12

shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction,
subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2004 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.      (2) The Company shall
not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.   
  (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares
of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of
qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the
Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock
could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received
in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock could
have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or
amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each
non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.   
  (c) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar business
combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least fifteen (15) Business Days before consummation of such
transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such
  
         H-13

transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash payment per
share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value per share of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, as of
the last Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is consummated. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close
of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of
withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction.      (d) In the event that a Purchase Offer (as defined below) shall have been made and shall be continuing, each holder of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert shares of 2004 ESOP
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price specified in Section 4(c)(iii)(C) hereof until the date the Purchase Offer is terminated, including without limitation because the original Purchase Offer is withdrawn or
because the Purchase Offer has expired and is not renewed, upon notice of such conversion given to the Company not later than the close of business on the date the Purchase Offer terminates (the  Purchase Offer Conversion Period ), unless
the Company or any successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of conversion so given may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the end of the Purchase Offer Conversion Period.   
  For purposes of this paragraph (d), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   
  (i)  Beneficial Ownership  shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ) and  person  shall have the meanings specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.      (ii) A  Purchase Offer  shall have been made when any person (other than the Company or any affiliate of the Company) shall have  commenced  (as such term is defined in
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase shares of Common Stock, such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined herein) or the right to acquire
Beneficial Ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company.      7.  Liquidation
Rights . (a) Upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to
its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the amount of $1,000.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends
(whether or not earned or declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution.   
  (b) Neither the sale of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, nor the merger or consolidation of the
Company into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this
Section 7.   
         H-14

(c) After the payment to the holders of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock of the
full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 7, the holders of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.   
  (d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock upon any
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7, no such distribution
shall be made on account of any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock upon such dissolution, liquidation, or winding up unless
proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up.      (e) Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series or class
or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after payment shall have been made in
full to the holders of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 7, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall,
subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share
therein.      8.  Ranking . For the purposes of these resolutions, any stock of any series or class or classes of
the Company shall be deemed to rank:      (a) prior to the shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or

to the holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock;      (b) on a parity with shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, either
as to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share, or sinking fund provisions, if any, be different from those of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, if the holders
of such stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without
preference or priority, one over the other, as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock; and      (c) junior to shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall be Common Stock or if the holders of shares of 2004 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such series or class or classes.

FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee I of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation
Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at a meeting of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000, and by the ESOP Committee pursuant to the written consent of the
ESOP Committee duly adopted on March 11, 2005, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1.
On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in
all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:   
  RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred Stock
Committee I (the  First Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of Company
common stock ($1-2/3 par value) issuable upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock, and in connection therewith, to fix the designations, voting powers, preferences, and all other rights, qualifications and restrictions of such ESOP Preferred Stock,
to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the First Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the First Committee shall deem necessary or
appropriate.      RESOLVED that Richard M. Kovacevich is designated to serve as the sole member of the First Committee until his
successor is duly elected and qualified.      * * * *      RESOLVED that any series of ESOP Preferred Stock authorized for issuance by the First Committee . . . shall have the voting rights set forth in Appendix A to these resolutions.   
         I-1

APPENDIX A - VOTING RIGHTS   
  No series of the Preferred Stock, except as hereinafter set forth in this resolution or as otherwise from time to time required by law,
shall have voting rights. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on any shares of a designated series of the Preferred Stock (such shares of such designated series of Preferred Stock being hereinafter referred to as the  Shares of
such series ) shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class
with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Shares of such series, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each
holder of the Shares of such series shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred
Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the
holders of such outstanding Shares of such series (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein
set forth. The right of such holders of such Shares of such series (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been
conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such Shares of such series shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such Shares of
such series shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.   
  Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the
term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.
Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as
may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      So long as any Shares of such series remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a
parity with such Shares of such series either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of
all such outstanding Shares of such series and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit,
effect or validate any one or more of the following:      (a) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any
increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to the Shares of such series with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
         I-2

(b) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designation for the Shares of such series designating the Shares of such series and the preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Shares of such series or of the holders
thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each
case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Shares of such series with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.      The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Shares of such series shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  2. On March 11, 2005, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in the ESOP Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted
the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED
that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:      2005 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and
Number of Shares; Restricted Issue .      (a) The designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided
for herein shall be  2005 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2005 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of authorized shares constituting the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock is 363,000, based
on an offering price for the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,067.10 per share. Each share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share. The number of authorized shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by
further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized,
provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided further that the number of authorized shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock
shall not be increased. All shares of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without
designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock.   
         I-3

(b) Shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the
 Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan (the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company
with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any
successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par
value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4
hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to
the Common Stock into which such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the transferee of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such transfer. Shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option.
Certificates representing shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of uncertificated 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the
foregoing provisions on each 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing
that the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of
Common Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion
may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.   
  2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time
to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2, as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times,
dividends payable on shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased
by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of
  
         I-4

shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as
aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except
as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by
such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the
remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by
such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company
irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      (c) So long as any shares of 2005 ESOP
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock
either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP
Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one
or more of the following:      (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued
amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
  (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the
amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares
of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers.      (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to
which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
         I-5

3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $97.50 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base
Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend
shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2006 and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2014, as follows:      (1) If the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a
Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2005 ESOP Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $102.50 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day
if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $107.50 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to
the Base Dividend.        Dividend Adjustment Table     
   
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2008, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $85.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$102.50, with the first quarterly payment of such $102.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2009. If on November 30, 2009, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $115.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock   
         I-6

would equal $107.50, with the first quarterly payment of such $107.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2010. If on November 30, 2010, the Current Market Price of one share of Common
Stock is $85.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $97.50, with the first quarterly payment of such $97.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2011.
     (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted Dividend  and  Second
Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading Day  shall have the meaning
given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared
with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.   
  (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base Dividend or to an
Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2005. Dividends on shares of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock will be cumulative from the
date of initial issuance of such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days
preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted
Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.      (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any stock of the Company ranking,
as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set
apart for such payment on shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of
2005 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on
a parity as to dividends with 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the
same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable
in cash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on 2005 ESOP
Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.      (ii) So long as any shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock are outstanding, no
dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants, or rights to   
         I-7

subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or any other stock ranking junior to 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i)
of this Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for
any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Company ranking junior to 2005 ESOP Preferred
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment of the then current dividend payment
period and all past dividend payment periods.      4.  Conversion . Shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock are
convertible from time to time hereafter pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 4 into that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the stated value of each share of 2005 ESOP Preferred

sentence, a new certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock which shall not have been converted.      (f) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock made pursuant to this Section 4 shall be effective

(h) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock as herein
provided, free from any preemptive rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock then outstanding.   
         I-10

(i) The Company will use its best efforts to cause the listing of the shares of Common
Stock required to be delivered upon conversion of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock prior to distribution to Plan participants on the national securities exchange, if any, upon which the outstanding Common Stock is listed at the time of such delivery.
     (j) The Company will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversions of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock to be converted and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid
to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.   
  5.  Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price per share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for
redemption, and (y) the Fair Market Value (as that term is defined in paragraph (d) of this Section 5) per share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock on the date fixed for redemption. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the
Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (c) of this Section 5. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock called for redemption will
cease to accrue and all rights in respect of such shares of the Company shall cease, except the right to receive the redemption price. Upon payment of the redemption price, such shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Company, to be
retired as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 1. If the full cumulative dividends have not been paid, or contemporaneously declared and set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company may not
redeem fewer than all the outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.      (b) Unless
otherwise required by law, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 will be sent to the holders of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock by
hand delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class mail (postage prepaid) delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may be, not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption
date. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) whether the redemption price shall be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash; (v) in the case of
certificated 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption
date; and (vii) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised and the manner in which the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of 2005 ESOP
Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed for redemption and at the   
         I-11

redemption price set forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of certificated 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the
certificates for the shares to be redeemed are surrendered (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).   
  (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred
Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or
their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2005 ESOP Preferred
Stock then being redeemed.      (d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth
below:      (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the
date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market Value  shall
mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment
Period. The  Fair Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the
security is to be determined, as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market
Value  of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by
the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of
Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock
would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal
(together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2005 ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about March 17, 2005 between the Company and
the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).      6.  Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  (a) If the
Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any
successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2005 ESOP
Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and   
         I-12

shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction,
subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2005 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.      (2) The Company shall
not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.   
  (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares
of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of
qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the
Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock
could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received
in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock could
have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or
amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each
non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.   
  (c) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar business
combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least fifteen (15) Business Days before consummation of such
transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such
  
         I-13

transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash payment per
share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value per share of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, as of
the last Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is consummated. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close
of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of
withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction.      (d) In the event that a Purchase Offer (as defined below) shall have been made and shall be continuing, each holder of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert shares of 2005 ESOP
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price specified in Section 4(c)(iii)(C) hereof until the date the Purchase Offer is terminated, including without limitation because the original Purchase Offer is withdrawn or
because the Purchase Offer has expired and is not renewed, upon notice of such conversion given to the Company not later than the close of business on the date the Purchase Offer terminates (the  Purchase Offer Conversion Period ), unless
the Company or any successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of conversion so given may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the end of the Purchase Offer Conversion Period.   
  For purposes of this paragraph (d), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   
  (i)  Beneficial Ownership  shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ) and  person  shall have the meanings specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.      (ii) A  Purchase Offer  shall have been made when any person (other than the Company or any affiliate of the Company) shall have  commenced  (as such term is defined in
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase shares of Common Stock, such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined herein) or the right to acquire
Beneficial Ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company.      7.  Liquidation
Rights . (a) Upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to
its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the amount of $1,000.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends
(whether or not earned or declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution.   
  (b) Neither the sale of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, nor the merger or consolidation of the
Company into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this
Section 7.   
         I-14

(c) After the payment to the holders of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock of the
full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 7, the holders of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.   
  (d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock upon any
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7, no such distribution
shall be made on account of any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock upon such dissolution, liquidation, or winding up unless
proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up.      (e) Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series or class
or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after payment shall have been made in
full to the holders of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 7, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall,
subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share
therein.      8.  Ranking . For the purposes of these resolutions, any stock of any series or class or classes of
the Company shall be deemed to rank:      (a) prior to the shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or
upon liquidation, if the holders of such series or class or classes shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority
to the holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock;      (b) on a parity with shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, either
as to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share, or sinking fund provisions, if any, be different from those of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, if the holders
of such stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without
preference or priority, one over the other, as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock; and      (c) junior to shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall be Common Stock or if the holders of shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such series or class or classes.   
  9.  Priority of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock . The shares of 2005 ESOP Preferred Stock will rank on a parity, both as to

       WELLS
FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee I of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation
Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at a meeting of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000, and by the ESOP Committee pursuant to the written consent of the
ESOP Committee duly adopted on March 17, 2006, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1.
On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in
all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:   
  RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred Stock
Committee I (the  First Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of Company
common stock ($1-2/3 par value) issuable upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock, and in connection therewith, to fix the designations, voting powers, preferences, and all other rights, qualifications and restrictions of such ESOP Preferred Stock,
to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the First Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the First Committee shall deem necessary or
appropriate.      RESOLVED that Richard M. Kovacevich is designated to serve as the sole member of the First Committee until his
successor is duly elected and qualified.      * * * *      RESOLVED that any series of ESOP Preferred Stock authorized for issuance by the First Committee . . . shall have the voting rights set forth in Appendix A to these resolutions.   
         J-1

APPENDIX A - VOTING RIGHTS   
  No series of the Preferred Stock, except as hereinafter set forth in this resolution or as otherwise from time to time required by law,
shall have voting rights. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on any shares of a designated series of the Preferred Stock (such shares of such designated series of Preferred Stock being hereinafter referred to as the  Shares of
such series ) shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class
with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Shares of such series, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each
holder of the Shares of such series shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred
Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the
holders of such outstanding Shares of such series (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein
set forth. The right of such holders of such Shares of such series (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been
conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such Shares of such series shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such Shares of
such series shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.   
  Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the
term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.
Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as
may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      So long as any Shares of such series remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a
parity with such Shares of such series either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of
all such outstanding Shares of such series and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit,
effect or validate any one or more of the following:      (a) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any
increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to the Shares of such series with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
         J-2

(b) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designation for the Shares of such series designating the Shares of such series and the preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Shares of such series or of the holders
thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each
case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Shares of such series with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.      The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Shares of such series shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  2. On March 17, 2006, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in the ESOP Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted
the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED
that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:      2006 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and
Number of Shares; Restricted Issue .      (a) The designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided
for herein shall be  2006 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2006 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of authorized shares constituting the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock is 414,000, based
on an offering price for the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,070.40 per share. Each share of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share. The number of authorized shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by
further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized,
provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided further that the number of authorized shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock
shall not be increased. All shares of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without
designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock.   
         J-3

(b) Shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the
 Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan (the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company
with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any
successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par
value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4
hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to
the Common Stock into which such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the transferee of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such transfer. Shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option.
Certificates representing shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of uncertificated 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the
foregoing provisions on each 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing
that the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of
Common Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion
may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.   
  2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time
to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2, as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times,
dividends payable on shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased
by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of
  
         J-4

shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as
aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except
as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by
such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the
remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by
such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company
irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      (c) So long as any shares of 2006 ESOP
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock
either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP
Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one
or more of the following:      (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued
amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
  (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the
amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares
of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers.      (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to
which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
         J-5

3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $107.50 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base
Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend
shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2007 and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2015, as follows:      (1) If the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a
Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2006 ESOP Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $112.50 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day
if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $117.50 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to
the Base Dividend.        Dividend Adjustment Table     
   
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2009, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $85.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$112.50, with the first quarterly payment of such $112.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2010. If on November 30, 2010, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $125.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock   
         J-6

would equal $117.50, with the first quarterly payment of such $117.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2011. If on November 30, 2011, the Current Market Price of one share of Common
Stock is $85.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $107.50, with the first quarterly payment of such $107.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2012.
     (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted Dividend  and  Second
Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading Day  shall have the meaning
given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared
with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.   
  (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base Dividend or to an
Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2006. Dividends on shares of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock will be cumulative from the
date of initial issuance of such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days
preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted
Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.      (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any stock of the Company ranking,
as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set
apart for such payment on shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of
2006 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on
a parity as to dividends with 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the
same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable
in cash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on 2006 ESOP
Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.      (ii) So long as any shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock are outstanding, no
dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants, or rights to   
         J-7

subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or any other stock ranking junior to 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i)
of this Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for
any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Company ranking junior to 2006 ESOP Preferred
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment of the then current dividend payment
period and all past dividend payment periods.      4.  Conversion . Shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock are
convertible from time to time hereafter pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 4 into that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the stated value of each share of 2006 ESOP Preferred

to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.   
  5.  Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in

otherwise required by law, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 will be sent to the holders of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock by
hand delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class mail (postage prepaid) delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may be, not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption
date. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) whether the redemption price shall be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash; (v) in the case of
certificated 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption
date; and (vii) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised and the manner in which the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of 2006 ESOP
Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed for redemption and at the   
         J-11

redemption price set forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of certificated 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the
certificates for the shares to be redeemed are surrendered (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).   
  (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred
Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or
their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2006 ESOP Preferred
Stock then being redeemed.      (d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth
below:      (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the
date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market Value  shall
mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment
Period. The  Fair Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the
security is to be determined, as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market
Value  of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by
the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of
Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock
would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal
(together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2006 ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about March 21, 2006 between the Company and
the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).      6.  Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  (a) If the
Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any
successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2006 ESOP
Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and   
         J-12

shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction,
subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2006 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.      (2) The Company shall
not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.   
  (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares
of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of
qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the
Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock
could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received
in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock could
have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or
amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each
non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.   
  (c) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar business
combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least fifteen (15) Business Days before consummation of such
transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such
  
         J-13

transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash payment per
share of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value per share of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, as of
the last Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is consummated. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close
of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of
withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction.      (d) In the event that a Purchase Offer (as defined below) shall have been made and shall be continuing, each holder of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert shares of 2006 ESOP
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price specified in Section 4(c)(iii)(C) hereof until the date the Purchase Offer is terminated, including without limitation because the original Purchase Offer is withdrawn or
because the Purchase Offer has expired and is not renewed, upon notice of such conversion given to the Company not later than the close of business on the date the Purchase Offer terminates (the  Purchase Offer Conversion Period ), unless
the Company or any successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of conversion so given may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the end of the Purchase Offer Conversion Period.   
  For purposes of this paragraph (d), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   
  (i)  Beneficial Ownership  shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ) and  person  shall have the meanings specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.      (ii) A  Purchase Offer  shall have been made when any person (other than the Company or any affiliate of the Company) shall have  commenced  (as such term is defined in
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase shares of Common Stock, such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined herein) or the right to acquire
Beneficial Ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company.      7.  Liquidation
Rights . (a) Upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to
its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the amount of $1,000.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends
(whether or not earned or declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution.   
  (b) Neither the sale of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, nor the merger or consolidation of the
Company into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this
Section 7.   
         J-14

(c) After the payment to the holders of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock of the
full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 7, the holders of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.   
  (d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock upon any
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7, no such distribution
shall be made on account of any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock upon such dissolution, liquidation, or winding up unless
proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up.      (e) Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series or class
or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after payment shall have been made in
full to the holders of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 7, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall,
subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share
therein.      8.  Ranking . For the purposes of these resolutions, any stock of any series or class or classes of
the Company shall be deemed to rank:      (a) prior to the shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or
upon liquidation, if the holders of such series or class or classes shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority
to the holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock;      (b) on a parity with shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, either
as to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share, or sinking fund provisions, if any, be different from those of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, if the holders
of such stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without
preference or priority, one over the other, as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock; and      (c) junior to shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall be Common Stock or if the holders of shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such series or class or classes.   
  9.  Priority of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock . The shares of 2006 ESOP Preferred Stock will rank on a parity, both as to
payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, with the Company s 1997 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, its 1998 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, its 1999 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock, its 2000 ESOP Cumulative   
         J-15

  2007 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      (Without Par Value)        
       WELLS
FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee I of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation
Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at a meeting of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000, and by the ESOP Committee pursuant to the written consent of the
ESOP Committee duly adopted on March 13, 2007, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1.
On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in
all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:   
  RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred Stock
Committee I (the  First Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of Company
common stock ($1 2/3 par value) issuable upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock, and in connection therewith, to fix the designations, voting powers, preferences, and all other rights, qualifications and restrictions of such ESOP Preferred Stock,
to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the First Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the First Committee shall deem necessary or
appropriate.      RESOLVED that Richard M. Kovacevich is designated to serve as the sole member of the First Committee until his
successor is duly elected and qualified.      * * * *      RESOLVED that any series of ESOP Preferred Stock authorized for issuance by the First Committee . . . shall have the voting rights set forth in Appendix A to these resolutions.   
         -1-

APPENDIX A - VOTING RIGHTS   
  No series of the Preferred Stock, except as hereinafter set forth in this resolution or as otherwise from time to time required by law,
shall have voting rights. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on any shares of a designated series of the Preferred Stock (such shares of such designated series of Preferred Stock being hereinafter referred to as the  Shares of
such series ) shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class
with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Shares of such series, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each
holder of the Shares of such series shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred
Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the
holders of such outstanding Shares of such series (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein
set forth. The right of such holders of such Shares of such series (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been
conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such Shares of such series shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such Shares of
such series shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.   
  Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the
term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.
Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as
may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      So long as any Shares of such series remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a
parity with such Shares of such series either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of
all such outstanding Shares of such series and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit,
effect or validate any one or more of the following:      (a) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any
increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to the Shares of such series with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
         -2-

(b) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designation for the Shares of such series designating the Shares of such series and the preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Shares of such series or of the holders
thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each
case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Shares of such series with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.      The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Shares of such series shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  2. On March 13, 2007, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in the ESOP Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted
the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED
that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:      2007 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and
Number of Shares; Restricted Issue .      (a) The designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided
for herein shall be  2007 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2007 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of authorized shares constituting the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock is 484,000, based
on an offering price for the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,070.00 per share. Each share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share. The number of authorized shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by
further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized,
provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided further that the number of authorized shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock
shall not be increased. All shares of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without
designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock.   
         -3-

(b) Shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the
 Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan (the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company
with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any
successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par
value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4
hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to
the Common Stock into which such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the transferee of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such transfer. Shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option.
Certificates representing shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of uncertificated 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the
foregoing provisions on each 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing
that the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of
Common Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion
may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.   
  2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time
to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2, as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times,
dividends payable on shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased
by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of
  
         -4-

shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as
aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except
as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by
such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the
remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by
such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company
irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      (c) So long as any shares of 2007 ESOP
Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock
either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP
Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one
or more of the following:      (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued
amount, of any class or series of stock ranking prior to shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
  (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the
amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares
of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers.      (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to
which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.

3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $107.50 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base
Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend
shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2008 and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2016, as follows:      (1) If the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a
Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2007 ESOP Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $112.50 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day
if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $117.50 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment
Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to
the Base Dividend.       Dividend Adjustment Table    
   
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2010, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $50, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $112.50,
with the first quarterly payment of such $112.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2011. If on November 30, 2011, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $65, then the cash dividend payable for the
  
         -6-

immediately following twelve month period per share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $117.50, with the first quarterly payment of such $117.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2012.
If on November 30, 2012, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $45, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $107.50, with the first
quarterly payment of such $107.50 dividend to be made on March 1, 2013.      (5) For purposes of this
Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted Dividend  and  Second Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in
Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading Day  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).   
  (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table shall be changed into a different number of
shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the
First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.      (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base Dividend or to an Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on
March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2007. Dividends on shares of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock will be cumulative from the date of initial issuance of such shares of 2007
ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be
fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount
of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.   
  (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any stock of the Company ranking, as to dividends, on
a parity with or junior to the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set apart for such
payment on shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of 2007 ESOP
Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity
as to dividends with 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio
that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash,
property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on 2007 ESOP Preferred
Stock which may be in arrears.   
         -7-

other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity
with 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed,
purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Company
ranking junior to 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment
of the then current dividend payment period and all past dividend payment periods.      4.  Conversion . Shares of
2007 ESOP Preferred Stock are convertible from time to time hereafter pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 4 into that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the stated value of each

Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption

If the full cumulative dividends have not been paid, or contemporaneously declared and set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP

share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed for redemption and at the redemption
price set forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of certificated 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the certificates for the shares to be redeemed are surrendered
(properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).      (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of
such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for
redemption of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock then being redeemed.   
  (d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   
  (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the date as of which

Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the security is to be determined,
as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market Value  of the 2007 ESOP Preferred
Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of Section 6 (in the case of a
redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock would have been paid when due,
and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal (together with accrued
interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2007 ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about March 20, 2007 between the Company and the Plan (including any
amendments or modifications thereto).      6.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  (a) If the Company consummates any
consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any successor or resulting
corporation (including the Company) that constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock of
such holder   
         -12-

shall, in connection with such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect
of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereon, that the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction, subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of
qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.   
  (2) The Company shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then
outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.      (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed,
reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph
(a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph
(c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2007 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the
aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to
such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transaction, which election cannot
practicably be made by the holders of the 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for
the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to
such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or
other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and
amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.      (c) In the event the Company shall enter into
any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar business combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any
event at least fifteen (15) Business Days before consummation of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall
  
         -13-

have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of
the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash payment per share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of
such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value per share of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, as of the last Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is
consummated. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall
waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction.
     (d) In the event that a Purchase Offer (as defined below) shall have been made and shall be continuing, each holder of
2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price specified in Section 4(c)(iii)(C) hereof until the date the Purchase Offer is terminated,
including without limitation because the original Purchase Offer is withdrawn or because the Purchase Offer has expired and is not renewed, upon notice of such conversion given to the Company not later than the close of business on the date the
Purchase Offer terminates (the  Purchase Offer Conversion Period ), unless the Company or any successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of conversion so given may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to
the Company prior to the end of the Purchase Offer Conversion Period.      For purposes of this paragraph (d), the following terms
shall have the meanings set forth below:      (i)  Beneficial Ownership  shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule
13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and  person  shall have the meanings specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.   
  (ii) A  Purchase Offer  shall have been made when any person (other than the Company or any affiliate of the Company)
shall have  commenced  (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase shares of Common Stock, such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have Beneficial
Ownership (as defined herein) or the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company.      7.  Liquidation Rights . (a) Upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be
paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the
amount of $1,000.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution.   
  (b) Neither the sale of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, nor the merger or consolidation of the
Company into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this
Section 7.   
         -14-

(c) After the payment to the holders of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock of the
full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 7, the holders of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.   
  (d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock upon any
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7, no such distribution
shall be made on account of any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock upon such dissolution, liquidation, or winding up unless
proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up.      (e) Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series or class
or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after payment shall have been made in
full to the holders of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 7, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall,
subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share
therein.      8.  Ranking . For the purposes of these resolutions, any stock of any series or class or classes of
the Company shall be deemed to rank:      (a) prior to the shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or
upon liquidation, if the holders of such series or class or classes shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority
to the holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock;      (b) on a parity with shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, either
as to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share, or sinking fund provisions, if any, be different from those of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, if the holders
of such stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without
preference or priority, one over the other, as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock; and      (c) junior to shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall be Common Stock or if the holders of shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such series or class or classes.   
  9.  Priority of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock . The shares of 2007 ESOP Preferred Stock will rank on a parity, both as to
payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, with the Company s 1998 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, its 1999 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, its 2000 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock, its 2001 ESOP Cumulative   
         -15-

  CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS      Pursuant to Section 151 of the      General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware             
  2008 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      (Without Par Value)        
       WELLS
FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee II of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General
Corporation Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at meetings of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000 and February 27, 2007, and by the ESOP Committee
pursuant to the written consent of the ESOP Committee duly adopted on March 11, 2008, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1. On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the
Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:
     RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred
Stock Committee II (the  Second Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of
Company common stock ($1 2/3 par value) issuable upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock, and in connection therewith, to fix the designations, voting powers, preferences, and all other rights, qualifications and restrictions of such ESOP Preferred
Stock, to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the Second Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the Second Committee shall deem necessary or
appropriate.      *  *  *  *   
  RESOLVED that any series of ESOP Preferred Stock authorized for issuance by the . . . Second Committee shall have the voting rights set
forth in Appendix A to these resolutions.      APPENDIX A - VOTING RIGHTS   
  No series of the Preferred Stock, except as hereinafter set forth in this resolution or as otherwise from time to time required by law,
shall have voting rights. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends   
         -1-

payable on any shares of a designated series of the Preferred Stock (such shares of such designated series of Preferred Stock being hereinafter referred to as the  Shares of such
series ) shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with
holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Shares of such series, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting
rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of
the Shares of such series shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held
as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such
outstanding Shares of such series (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The
right of such holders of such Shares of such series (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such Shares of such series shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such Shares of such series shall
terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by such
holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the
remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by
such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company
irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      So long as any Shares of such series remain
outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding Shares of such series and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such Shares of such series either as to dividends or the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding Shares of such series and such other series of Preferred Stock voting
together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one or more of the following:   
  (a) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of
stock ranking prior to the Shares of such series with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
  (b) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the   
         -2-

resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designation for the Shares of such series designating the Shares of such series and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other
special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Shares of such series or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any
increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or
junior to the Shares of such series with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers.      The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which
such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Shares of such series shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  2. Pursuant to resolutions adopted on February 27, 2007, the Board designated John G. Stumpf as the sole member of the ESOP
Committee, effective April 25, 2007.      3. On March 11, 2008, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in
the ESOP Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional,
and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:   
  2008 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and Number of Shares; Restricted Issue .      (a) The
designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided for herein shall be  2008 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2008 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of
authorized shares constituting the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock is 520,500, based on an offering price for the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,058.00 per share. Each share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share.
The number of authorized shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized, provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided
further that the number of authorized shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be increased. All shares of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the
status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock.      (b) Shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the  Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan
  
         -3-

(the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor
trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred
Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common
Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting
powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to the Common Stock into which such shares of 2008 ESOP
Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the transferee of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2008
ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such transfer. Shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option. Certificates representing shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred
Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of uncertificated 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the foregoing provisions on each 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock book
entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing that the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to
the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of
Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion may be transferred by the holder thereof as
permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.      2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2,
as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in
arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of
shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each
holder of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share
of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by
vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and
are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall   
         -4-

continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2008 ESOP
Preferred Stock shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.   
  (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein
provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of
which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of
directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.      (c) So long as any shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series
of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual
meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one or more of the following:   
  (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock
ranking prior to shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or      (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a
Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and
adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of
other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends
and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.   
  (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would
otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the
Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $105.00 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as provided in this Section 3.   
         -5-

(ii) The Base Dividend shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2009 and on
each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2017, as follows:      (1) If the Current Market Price
(as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or
greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following
twelve month period equal to $110.00 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).      (2) If the
Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second
Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $115.00 per share (the  Second
Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on
November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of
shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to the Base Dividend.       Dividend Adjustment Table        
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2011, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $50.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$110.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $110.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2012. If on November 30, 2012, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $60.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $115.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $115.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2013. If on November 30, 2013, the Current Market Price of one share
of Common   
         -6-

Stock is $40.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $105.00, with the first quarterly payment of
such $105.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2014.      (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the
terms  First Adjusted Dividend  and  Second Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv);
and the term  Trading Day  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of
Common Stock in any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted.      (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are
equal to the Base Dividend or to an Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2008. Dividends on shares of the 2008 ESOP
Preferred Stock will be cumulative from the date of initial issuance of such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not
more than 30 days nor less than 15 days preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by
four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed
in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.      (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment
on any stock of the Company ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient
for the payment thereof has been set apart for such payment on shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in
full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and any
other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock
shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any
dividend payment or payments on 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.      (ii) So long as any shares of 2008
ESOP Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants, or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or any other stock ranking junior to 2008 ESOP Preferred
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i) of this   
         -7-

Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a
parity with 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be
redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of
the Company ranking junior to 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside
for payment of the then current dividend payment period and all past dividend payment periods.

     (j) The Company will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the

  5.  Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price per share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for
redemption, and (y) the Fair Market Value (as that term is defined in paragraph (d) of this Section 5) per share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock on the date fixed for redemption. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the
Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (c) of this Section 5. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock called for redemption will
cease to accrue and all rights in respect of such shares of the Company shall cease, except the right to receive the redemption price. Upon payment of the redemption price, such shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Company, to be
retired as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 1. If the full cumulative dividends have not been paid, or contemporaneously declared and set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company may not
redeem fewer than all the outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.      (b) Unless
otherwise required by law, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 will be sent to the holders of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock by
hand delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class mail (postage prepaid) delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may be, not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption
date. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such
shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) whether the redemption price shall be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash; (v) in the case of
certificated 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption
date; and (vii) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised and the manner in which the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of 2008 ESOP
Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed for redemption and at the redemption price set forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of
certificated 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, the   
         -11-

Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the certificates for the shares to be redeemed are surrendered (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of
Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).      (c) The Company, at its option, may make
payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes
at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of
the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock then being redeemed.      (d) For
purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:      (i)  Adjustment
Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market Value  shall mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average
of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment Period. The  Fair Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall
mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the security is to be determined, as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected
in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market Value  of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair
market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption
pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent
appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock
pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal (together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2008 ESOP Convertible
Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about March 13, 2008 between the Company and the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).      6.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  (a) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock
are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a
holder of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor
provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed
by and shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or
  
         -12-

other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock had
immediately prior to such transaction, subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of
the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.      (2) The Company shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the
successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.      (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar
business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof,
other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2008
ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction
immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such
transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election
with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such
transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities,
cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities,
cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.   
  (c) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar business
combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least fifteen (15) Business Days before consummation of such
transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such
transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash payment per share of
  
         -13-

2008 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value
per share of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, as of the last Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is consummated. No such notice of redemption shall be effective
unless given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given
prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction.   
  (d) In the event that a Purchase Offer (as defined below) shall have been made and shall be continuing, each holder of 2008 ESOP
Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price specified in Section 4(c)(iii)(C) hereof until the date the Purchase Offer is terminated, including without
limitation because the original Purchase Offer is withdrawn or because the Purchase Offer has expired and is not renewed, upon notice of such conversion given to the Company not later than the close of business on the date the Purchase Offer
terminates (the  Purchase Offer Conversion Period ), unless the Company or any successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of conversion so given may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company
prior to the end of the Purchase Offer Conversion Period.      For purposes of this paragraph (d), the following terms shall have
the meanings set forth below:      (i)  Beneficial Ownership  shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and  person  shall have the meanings specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.   
  (ii) A  Purchase Offer  shall have been made when any person (other than the Company or any affiliate of the Company)
shall have  commenced  (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase shares of Common Stock, such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have Beneficial
Ownership (as defined herein) or the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company.      7.  Liquidation Rights . (a) Upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be
paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the
amount of $1,000.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution.   
  (b) Neither the sale of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, nor the merger or consolidation of the
Company into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this
Section 7.      (c) After the payment to the holders of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock of the full preferential
amounts provided for in this Section 7, the holders of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.   
         -14-

(d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of
shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock upon any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this Section 7, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock upon such
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity
shares are respectively entitled upon such dissolution, liquidation, or winding up.      (e) Subject to the rights of the
holders of the shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Company, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the shares of 2008 ESOP Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 7, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the shares of
2008 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2008 ESOP

 Corporation ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the  Board of Directors ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation,
as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value, and pursuant to authority conferred upon the Securities Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Committee ) in accordance
with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation Law ), the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Committee pursuant to the written consent of the Committee duly adopted on
November 20, 2008, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED, that pursuant to the
authority vested in the Committee and in accordance with the resolutions of the Board of Directors dated October 2, 2008, the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws of the Corporation and applicable law, a series
of Preferred Stock, no par value, of the Corporation be and hereby is created, and that the designation and number of shares of such series, and the voting and other powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series, are as follows:      1.
 Designation.       (a) The shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be designated Dividend Equalization Preferred
Shares ( DEPs ), and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 97,000.      (b) DEPs redeemed, purchased
or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (other than in a bona fide fiduciary capacity) shall be cancelled and may not be reissued. DEPs may be issued in fractional shares which are whole number multiples of one
one-millionth of a share, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder s fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a whole share of DEPs.   
  (c) DEPs shall, with respect to distributions upon the liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of the Corporation, rank (x) senior
to the Common Stock for the Liquidation Preference stated and defined in Section 3(a) below and (y) junior to each class or series of preferred stock issued in exchange for preferred stock of Wachovia Corporation established by the board
of directors of Wachovia Corporation after September 1, 2001 and each class or series of preferred stock established by the Board of Directors after the date hereof.   
         -1-

2.  Dividends.  DEPs shall not entitle the holders thereof to any dividends, whether
payable in cash, property, stock or otherwise.      3.  Liquidation.    
  (a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the
holders of full and fractional DEPs shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the DEPs upon liquidation, to be paid in full an
amount per whole share of DEPs equal to $10.00 (the  Liquidation Preference ), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all
holders of DEPs, the holders of DEPs as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.   
  (b) In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of DEPs upon any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3(a), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any
other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the DEPs upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the DEPs, ratably in proportion to the full
distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.      (c) Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of DEPs then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its
shareholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 3 before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation
to the DEPs.      (d) For the purposes of this Section 3, the consolidation or merger of, or binding statutory share
exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.      4.  Redemption, Conversion, Exchange.       (a) The DEPs shall not be
convertible or exchangeable. Other than as described in the next sentence, the DEPs shall not be redeemable. The DEPs shall be redeemable by the Corporation, at the Corporation s option and in its sole discretion, for an amount in cash equal to
the Liquidation Preference per share of DEPs, after December 31, 2021.      (b) In case of redemption of less than all of
the DEPs at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata or by lot as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion, provided that the Corporation may redeem all shares held by holders of fewer than 0.100 DEPs
(or by holders that would hold fewer than 0.100 DEPs following such redemption) prior to its redemption of other DEPs.   
         -2-

(c) Notice of any redemption shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation no less than
30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date specified for redemption in such notice (the  Redemption Date ), by first class mail, postage prepaid, to all holders of record of the DEPs at their last addresses as they appear on the books of
the Corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any DEPs except as to the holder to whom the Corporation has
failed to give notice or except as to the holder to whom notice was defective. In addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation or the rules of any exchange upon which the DEPs may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice
shall state (1) that such redemption is being made pursuant to the redemption provisions of this Section 5, (2) the Redemption Date, (3) the redemption price, (4) the total number of DEPs to be redeemed and, if less than all
shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed, and (5) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, including any procedures
applicable to redemption to be accomplished through book-entry transfers. Upon the mailing of any such notice of redemption, the Corporation shall become obligated to redeem, on the Redemption Date, all shares called for redemption.   
  5.  Voting Rights . Except as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation or the rules of a securities
exchange upon which the DEPs may be listed or quoted, holders of the DEPs shall have no voting rights.

the Series G Preferred Stock for cash, with the prior approval of the OCC, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time for the Redemption Price from funds legally available for such purpose. In the event the Corporation redeems fewer than
all the outstanding Series A Preferred Securities, the shares to be redeemed shall be determined by lot,  pro rata , or by such other method as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion determines.   
  (c) Not more than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to the date established for such redemption by the Board of
Directors (the  Redemption Date ), notice of the proposed redemption shall be mailed to the holders of record of the Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed, such notice to be addressed to each such stockholder at his last known address
shown on the records of the Corporation, and the time of mailing such notice shall be deemed to be the time of the giving thereof. On or after the Redemption Date, the Series G Preferred Stock called for redemption shall automatically, and without
further action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed to have been redeemed and the former holder thereof shall thereupon only be entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price. If such notice of redemption shall have been given as
aforesaid, and if on or before the Redemption Date the funds necessary for the redemption shall have been set aside so as to be available therefore, then the dividends thereon shall cease to accrue after the Redemption Date and all rights with
respect to the Series G Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall forthwith after such Redemption Date cease, except the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price, without interest. If such notice of redemption of all or any part of
the Series G Preferred Stock shall have been mailed as aforesaid and the Corporation shall thereafter deposit money for the payment of the Redemption Price pursuant thereto with any bank or trust company (the  Depositary Company ),
including any Affiliate of the Corporation, selected by the Board of Directors for that purpose, to be applied to such   
         -5-

redemption, then from and after the making of such deposit, such Series G Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose, and the rights of the holders thereof shall be
limited to the rights to receive payment of the Redemption Price, without interest but including any declared, authorized, but unpaid, dividends to the Redemption Date, from the Depositary Company, if applicable, upon endorsement, if required, and
surrender of the certificates therefore. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company, the interest, if any, allowed on such moneys deposited with it, and the holders of any Series G Preferred Stock so
redeemed shall have no claim to any such interest. Any moneys so deposited and remaining unclaimed at the end of three years from the Redemption Date shall, if thereafter requested by resolution of the Board of Directors, be repaid to the
Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, such holders of record of the Series G Preferred Stock so redeemed which shall not have made claim against such moneys prior to such repayment to the Corporation shall be deemed to
be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of the Series G Preferred Stock and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.
     (d) Subject to the provisions herein, the Board of Directors shall have authority to prescribe from time to
time the manner in which the Series G Preferred Stock shall be redeemed.      (e) Nothing contained herein shall
limit any legal right of the Corporation to purchase any shares of the Series G Preferred Stock.      6.  Conversion . The
holders of the Series G Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series G Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.      7.  Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors, without the
vote of the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or any class or series of stock ranking senior to Series G Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of affairs of the Corporation.      8.  Repurchase . Subject to the limitations
imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series G Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine;  provided ,  however , that the Corporation shall
not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.      9.  Voting Rights . The holders of Series G Preferred Stock will have no voting rights except as expressly provided by applicable law.   
  10.  Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series G Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed
or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock without designation as to series.      11.  No Sinking Fund . Shares of Series G Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.

(c) The sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed

Securities, except upon the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Event. On or after the fifth anniversary of the initial issuance of the WPFC Series B Preferred Securities, the Corporation may, with the prior approval of the OCC, redeem the

established for such redemption by the Board of Directors (the  Redemption Date ), notice of the proposed redemption shall be mailed to the holders of record of the Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed, such notice to be addressed
to each such stockholder at his last known address shown on the records of the Corporation, and the time of mailing such notice shall be deemed to be the time of the giving thereof. On or after the Redemption Date, the Series H Preferred Stock
called for redemption shall automatically, and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed to have been redeemed and the former holder thereof shall thereupon only be entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price. If
such notice of redemption shall have been given as aforesaid, and if on or before the Redemption Date the funds necessary for the redemption shall have been set aside so as to be available therefore, then the dividends thereon shall cease to accrue
after the Redemption Date and all rights with respect to the Series H Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall forthwith after such Redemption Date cease, except the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price, without interest.
If such notice of redemption of all or any part of the Series H Preferred Stock shall have been mailed as aforesaid and the Corporation shall thereafter deposit money for the payment of the Redemption Price pursuant thereto with any bank or
trust company (the  Depositary Company ),   
         -6-

including any Affiliate of the Corporation, selected by the Board of Directors for that purpose, to be applied to such redemption, then from and after the making of such deposit, such
Series H Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose, and the rights of the holders thereof shall be limited to the rights to receive payment of the Redemption Price, without interest but including any declared,
authorized, but unpaid, dividends to the Redemption Date, from the Depositary Company, if applicable, upon endorsement, if required, and surrender of the certificates therefore. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from
the Depositary Company, the interest, if any, allowed on such moneys deposited with it, and the holders of any Series H Preferred Stock so redeemed shall have no claim to any such interest. Any moneys so deposited and remaining unclaimed at the
end of three years from the Redemption Date shall, if thereafter requested by resolution of the Board of Directors, be repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, such holders of record of the Series H
Preferred Stock so redeemed which shall not have made claim against such moneys prior to such repayment to the Corporation shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above
for the redemption of the Series H Preferred Stock and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.      (e) Subject to the provisions herein, the Board of Directors shall have authority to prescribe from time to time the manner in which the Series H Preferred Stock shall be redeemed.   
  (f) Nothing contained herein shall limit any legal right of the Corporation to purchase any shares of the Series H
Preferred Stock.      6.  Conversion . The holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert
such Series H Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.      7.  Rank .
Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the Board of Directors, without the vote of the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock, may
authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or any class or series of stock ranking senior to Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of affairs
of the Corporation.      8.  Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell
Series H Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.      9.  Voting
Rights . The holders of Series H Preferred Stock will have no voting rights except as expressly provided by applicable law.      10.  Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series H Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall
be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock without designation as to series.      11.  No

accrue at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) Three-Month LIBOR for the related Dividend Period plus 0.93% and (y) 5.56975%. The amount of dividends payable for any Dividend Period (1) ending prior to the Dividend Payment
Date in March 2011 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and (2) beginning on or after the Dividend Payment Date in March 2011 shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number
of days elapsed.      (b)  Non-Cumulative Dividends . Dividends on shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be
non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series I Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not
cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends accrued for the Dividend Period ending immediately prior to
such Dividend Payment Date after such Dividend Payment Date or to pay interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series I Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior
Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Corporation. Holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full dividends for each
Dividend Period on the Series I Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any Dividend Payment or Dividend Payments or failure to make any Dividend Payment or Dividend Payments.   
         -3-

(c)  Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series I Preferred
Stock remains outstanding, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock,
(ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the
exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to
or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation, and (iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than
pursuant to  pro rata  offers to purchase all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series I Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series
I Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and set aside for payment. The foregoing shall not restrict the ability of the Corporation, or any affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making
transactions in the Junior Stock or Parity Stock in the ordinary course of business. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series I Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series I Preferred Stock
and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series I Preferred
Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations on Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on such offered stock that may be in arrears. If the board of directors determines not to
pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide written notice to the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in
cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the board of directors may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available therefor, and the shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to
participate in any such dividend.      Section 5.  Liquidation Rights .   
  (a)  Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Corporation, holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the
holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series I Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidation preference in an
amount equal to $100,000 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series I Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further payments in the
event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.   
  (b)  Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference
to all holders of Series I Preferred Stock and the liquidation   
         -4-

preferences of any Parity Stock to all holders of such Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series I Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in
accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of Series I Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.      (c)  Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series I Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be
entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.      (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other
consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or
any other business combination transaction of the Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be
deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.   
  Section 6.  Redemption .      (a)  Optional Redemption . So long as full dividends for all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for
the payment thereof set aside, the Corporation, at the option of the board of directors, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at any time on or after the later of March 15, 2011 and the
date of original issuance of the Series I Preferred Stock, upon notice given as provided in Subsection (b) below, at the redemption price in effect at the redemption date as provided in this Section 6. The redemption price for shares of
Series I Preferred Stock shall be $100,000 per share plus dividends that have been declared but not paid plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to the redemption date.   
  (b)  Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be mailed by
first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before
the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series I Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC. Any notice mailed as provided in this
Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of
Series I Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series I Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of
shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the Series I Preferred Stock are to be redeemed; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on
the redemption date.   
         -5-

(c)  Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the
shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series I Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series I
Preferred Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the board of directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the board of directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the
terms and conditions upon which shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.      (d)
 Effectiveness of Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from
its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the board of
directors (the  Depositary Company ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered
for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such
shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date the funds so
deposited, without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such
interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of
record of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall
in no event be entitled to any interest.      Section 7.  Voting Rights . The holders of Series I Preferred Stock will
have no voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any directors, except as expressly provided by law.      Section 8.
 Conversion . The holders of Series I Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such Series I Preferred Stock into shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation.   
  Section 9.  Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or this
Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the board of directors, without the vote of the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock, Parity Stock or any class of securities ranking senior
to the Series I Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.      Section 10.  Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series I Preferred Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon
such terms as the board of directors may determine; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be,
rendered insolvent.   
         -6-

Section 11.  Unissued or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series I Preferred Stock
not issued or which have been issued and converted, redeemed or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock without designation as to series.   
  Section 12.  No Sinking Fund . Shares of Series I Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.

in any market-making transactions in the Junior Stock or Parity Stock in the ordinary course of business. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series J Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of
Series J Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share

directors determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide written notice to the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise,
such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the board of directors may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available therefor, and the shares of Series J Preferred
Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.      Section 5.  Liquidation Rights.

any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series J Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidation preference in an amount
  
         -3-

equal to $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series J Preferred Stock shall
not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.   
  (b)  Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference to all holders
of Series J Preferred Stock and the liquidation preferences of any Parity Stock to all holders of such Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in
accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of Series J Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.      (c)

person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation.      Section 6.  Redemption.       (a)  Optional Redemption . So long as full dividends for all outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for
the payment thereof set aside, and subject to applicable regulatory approvals, the Corporation, at the option of the board of directors, may redeem in whole or in part the shares of Series J Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any Dividend
Payment Date on or after December 15, 2017 upon notice given as provided in Subsection (b) below, at the redemption price in effect at the redemption date as provided in this Section 6. The redemption price for shares of Series J
Preferred Stock shall be $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period, without interest.      (b)  Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series J Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to
be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series J Preferred
Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder
receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series J Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series J Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; and
(iv) the place or places where the Series J Preferred Stock are to be redeemed.   
         -4-

(c)  Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of
Series J Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series J Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series J Preferred
Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the board of directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the board of directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and
conditions upon which shares of Series J Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.      (d)  Effectiveness of
Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds, in
trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the board of directors (the
  Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for
cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares
shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date the funds so deposited,
without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any
funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the
shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event
be entitled to any interest.      Section 7.  Voting Rights . The holders of Series J Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by applicable law.      (a)  Right To Elect
Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events . If and whenever the dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock or any class or series of Voting Parity Stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for at least six
Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive) (a   Nonpayment Event  ), the number of directors then constituting the board of directors shall automatically be increased by two and the holders of Series J Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single and separate class with the holders of any outstanding shares of Voting Parity Stock, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors (the   Preferred Stock Directors  ) by a plurality of the
votes cast,  provided  that it shall be a qualification for election for any such Preferred Stock Director that the election of such director shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock
Exchange (or any other securities exchange or other trading facility on which securities of the Corporation may then be listed or traded) that listed or traded companies must have a majority of independent directors, and  provided further  that
the board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors (including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of any series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to like voting
rights).      In the event that the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and such other holders of Voting Parity Stock shall be
entitled to vote for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment   
         -5-

Event, such directors shall be initially elected following such Nonpayment Event at the Corporation s next annual meeting of shareholders, and, except as provided below, at each subsequent
annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation.      When dividends have been paid in full on the Series J Preferred Stock and
any and all Voting Parity Stock for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods or their equivalent after a Nonpayment Event, then the right of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease (but subject
always to revesting of such voting rights in the case of any future Nonpayment Event), and, if and when all rights of holders of Series J Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall have ceased, the terms of
office of all the Preferred Stock Directors shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly.   
  Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series J
Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock, when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single and separate class). In case any vacancy shall occur among the Preferred Stock Directors, a successor shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock having the voting rights described above, voting together as a single and separate class. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote
per director on any matter that shall come before the board of directors for a vote.      (b)  Other Voting Rights . So long

any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting corporation, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or
resulting corporation or a corporation controlling such corporation, and (y) such Series J Preferred Stock shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting
powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series J Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;   
   provided ,  however , that any amendment of the certificate of incorporation to authorize or create or to increase the authorized amount of
any Junior Stock or any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of Parity Stock or Junior Stock will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series J

share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(b) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series J Preferred Stock), then only those series affected

Section 6.      (e)  Procedures for Voting and Consents . The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any
meeting of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or
matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the board of directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the certificate of
incorporation, the bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility in which the Series J Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or
other portion of the shares of Series J Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series J Preferred Stock are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by
reference to the specified liquidation amounts of the shares voted or covered by the consent.

including a Dividend Payment Date (or the date of issuance of the Series K Preferred Stock for the first Dividend Payment Date) to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date;  provided  that the first Dividend Period shall be deemed to have

Dividends on shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series K Preferred Stock on any
Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay, and the

  (c)  Priority of Dividends . So long as any share of Series K Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless full dividends on all
outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid in full or declared and set aside for payment, (i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be
declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation,
directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of
the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation, and (iii) no shares of

conversion of one share of Parity Stock for or into another share of Parity Stock or for or into Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock),
nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation, otherwise than pursuant to  pro rata  offers to purchase all, or a  pro rata  portion, of the Series K
Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock. The foregoing shall not restrict the ability of the Corporation, or any affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Junior Stock or Parity Stock in the ordinary course of
business. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series K Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series K Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the
amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series K Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on Parity Stock,
bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on such Parity Stock that may be in arrears. If the board of directors determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the
Corporation will provide written notice to the holders of the Series K Preferred Stock prior to such date. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the board of
directors may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available therefor, and the shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.   
  Section 5.  Liquidation Rights .      (a)  Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, holders of Series K Preferred Stock shall be entitled, before
any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Corporation may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Series
K Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Corporation s depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidation preference in an amount equal to $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends
for the then-current Dividend Period to the date of liquidation. The holder of Series K Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.   
         -4-

(b)  Partial Payment . If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in
full the liquidation preference to all holders of Series K Preferred Stock and the liquidation preferences of any Parity Stock to all holders of such Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and to the holders of all
Parity Stock shall be  pro rata  in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of Series K Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock.      (c)  Residual Distributions . If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series K Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be
entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.      (d)
 Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation . For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the
property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the
Corporation into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.      Section 6.  Redemption .   
  (a)  Optional Redemption . So long as full dividends for all outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock and Parity Stock for the
then-current Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside, and subject to applicable regulatory approvals, the Corporation, at the option of the board of directors, may redeem in whole or in part
the shares of Series K Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after March 15, 2018 upon notice given as provided in Subsection (b) below, at the redemption price in effect at the redemption date as
provided in this Section 6. The redemption price for shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall be $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period, without interest.   
  (b)  Notice of Redemption . Notice of every redemption of shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for
redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series K Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series K Preferred Stock
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series K Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series K Preferred
Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; and (iv) the place or places where the Series K Preferred Stock are to be redeemed.   
         -5-

(c)  Partial Redemption . In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of
Series K Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Series K Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata  from the holders of record of Series K Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Series K Preferred
Stock held by such holders or by lot or in such other manner as the board of directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the board of directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and
conditions upon which shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.      (d)  Effectiveness of
Redemption . If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds, in
trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company selected by the board of directors (the
  Depositary Company  ) in trust for the  pro rata  benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for
cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue after such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares
shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company at any time after the redemption date the funds so deposited,
without interest. The Corporation shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Depositary Company any interest accrued on such funds, and the holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any
funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Corporation, and in the event of such repayment to the Corporation, the holders of record of the
shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation, but shall in no event
be entitled to any interest.      Section 7.  Voting Rights . The holders of Series K Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by applicable law.      (a)  Right To Elect
Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events . If and whenever the dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock or any class or series of Voting Parity Stock have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for at least six
Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive) (a   Nonpayment Event  ), the number of directors then constituting the board of directors shall automatically be increased by two and the holders of Series K Preferred
Stock, voting together as a single and separate class with the holders of any outstanding shares of Voting Parity Stock, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors (the   Preferred Stock Directors  ) by a plurality of the
votes cast,  provided  that it shall be a qualification for election for any such Preferred Stock Director that the election of such director shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock
Exchange (or any other securities exchange or other trading facility on which securities of the Corporation may then be listed or traded) that listed or traded companies must have a majority of independent directors, and  provided further  that
the board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors (including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of any series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to like voting
rights).      In the event that the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and such other holders of Voting Parity Stock shall be
entitled to vote for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment   
         -6-

Event, such directors shall be initially elected following such Nonpayment Event at the Corporation s next annual meeting of shareholders, and, except as provided below, at each subsequent
annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation.      When dividends have been paid in full on the Series K Preferred Stock and
any and all Voting Parity Stock for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods or their equivalent after a Nonpayment Event, then the right of the holders of Series K Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease (but subject
always to revesting of such voting rights in the case of any future Nonpayment Event), and, if and when all rights of holders of Series K Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall have ceased, the terms of
office of all the Preferred Stock Directors shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly.   
  Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series K
Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock, when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single and separate class). In case any vacancy shall occur among the Preferred Stock Directors, a successor shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock having the voting rights described above, voting together as a single and separate class. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote
per director on any matter that shall come before the board of directors for a vote.      (b)  Other Voting Rights . So long
as any shares of Series K Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or by the certificate of incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of
Series K Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting separately as a single class with all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series K Preferred Stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in
person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law:
     (i)  Issuance of Senior Stock . The issuance of any class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation
ranking senior to the Series K Preferred Stock with respect to either the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation;
     (ii)  Amendment Affecting Series K Preferred Stock . Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision
of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws so as to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series K Preferred Stock;      (iii)  Authorization of Senior Stock . Any amendment or alteration of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws to authorize, create or increase the authorized amount of, any shares
of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series K Preferred Stock with respect to either the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event of
any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation; or      (iv)
 Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations . Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series K Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another

 Redemption . The shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.      Section 7.  Voting Rights . The
holders of Series L Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by applicable law.      (a)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events . If after the issuance of the Series L Preferred Stock the Corporation fails to pay, or declare and set aside for payment, full dividends on
the Series L Preferred Stock or any class or series of Voting Parity Stock for six Dividend Periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive) (a   Nonpayment Event  ), the number of directors then constituting the board of
directors shall automatically be increased by two and the holders of Series L Preferred Stock, voting together as a single and separate class with the holders of all outstanding shares of Voting Parity Stock, shall be entitled to elect the two
additional directors (the   Preferred Stock Directors  ) by a plurality of the votes cast; provided that it shall be a qualification for election for any such Preferred Stock Director that the election of such director shall not cause
the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other securities exchange or other trading facility on which securities of the Corporation may then be listed or traded) that listed or traded
companies must have a majority of independent directors; and provided further that the board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors (including, for purposes of this limitation, all directors that the holders of
any series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to like voting rights).      In the event that the holders of
Series L Preferred Stock and such other holders of Voting Parity Stock shall be entitled to vote for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment Event, such directors shall be initially elected following such Nonpayment
Event at the Corporation s next annual meeting of shareholders, and, except as provided below, at each subsequent annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation.      When dividends have been paid in full on the Series L Preferred Stock and any and all Voting Parity Stock for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods or their equivalent after a Nonpayment Event, then
the right of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall cease (but subject always to revesting of such rights in the case of any future Nonpayment Event), and, if and when all rights of holders of Series L
Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall have ceased, the terms of office of all the Preferred Stock Directors shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of directors
shall automatically be reduced accordingly.      Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series L Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock, when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single and separate class). In case any vacancy shall occur among the
Preferred Stock Directors, a successor shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Series L Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock having the voting rights described above, voting together as a single and separate class. The
Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter that shall come before the board of directors for a vote.   
         -9-

(b)  Other Voting Rights . So long as any shares of Series L
Preferred Stock are outstanding, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3 % of the shares of Series L Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting separately as a single class with all other classes
or series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series L Preferred Stock and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for
effecting or validating any of the following actions, whether or not such approval is required by Delaware law:      (i)
 Amendment Affecting Series L Preferred Stock . Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws so as to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series L
Preferred Stock.      (ii)  Authorization or Issuance of Senior Stock . Any amendment or alteration of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws to authorize, create or increase the authorized amount of, or any issuance of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of Capital Stock of the Corporation ranking senior
to the Series L Preferred Stock with respect to either the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets in the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up and liquidation of the affairs of the Corporation; or   
  (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations . Any consummation of a binding share exchange or
reclassification involving the Series L Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another Person, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series L Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such
merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting Person, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting Person or a Person controlling such Person, and
(y) such Series L Preferred Stock shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders
thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series L Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;       provided , 
however , that any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of or issuance of Series L Preferred Stock or any class or series of Parity Stock or Junior Stock or any securities convertible into any class or series of Parity
Stock (whether dividends payable in respect of such Parity Stock are cumulative or non-cumulative) or Junior Stock will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series L Preferred Stock, and
holders of the Series L Preferred Stock shall have no right to vote thereon.      If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share
exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(b) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series L Preferred Stock), then only those series affected by and
entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock).      (c)  Changes for Clarification . Without the consent of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting
powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series L Preferred Stock, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series L Preferred Stock:   
  (i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designations that may be
defective or inconsistent; or   
         -10-

(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the
Series L Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations.      (d)  Procedures
for Voting and Consents . The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of
proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the board of directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which
rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility in which the Series L Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the
time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series L Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series L
Preferred Stock are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts of the shares voted or covered by the consent.      For purposes of determining the voting rights of the holders of Series L Preferred Stock under this Section 7, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 of liquidation preference to
which his or her shares are entitled. Holders of shares of Series L Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote for each such share of Series L Preferred Stock held by them.      Section 8.  Rank . Notwithstanding anything set forth in the certificate of incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to the contrary, the board of directors, without the vote of the
holders of the Series L Preferred Stock, may authorize and issue additional shares of Junior Stock or Parity Stock.   
  Section 9.  Repurchase . Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell Series L Preferred
Stock from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine;  provided ,  however , that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable
grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rendered insolvent.      Section 10.  Unissued or
Reacquired Shares . Shares of Series L Preferred Stock not issued or which have been issued and converted in accordance with the terms hereof or otherwise purchased or acquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock without designation as to series.      Section 11.  No Sinking Fund . Shares of Series L
Preferred Stock are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund.      Section 12.  Right to Convert . Each
Holder shall have the right, at such Holder s option, at any time, to convert all or any portion of such Holder s Series L Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Rate (subject to the conversion procedures
set forth in Section 13 herein) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares.      Section 13.  Conversion .   
  (a)  Conversion Procedures .   
         -11-

(i) Effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date
or any applicable Conversion Date, dividends shall no longer be declared on any converted shares of Series L Preferred Stock and such shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, in each case, subject to the right of Holders to
receive any declared and unpaid dividends on such shares and any other payments to which they are otherwise entitled pursuant to Section 12, Section 13(b), Section 13(c), Section 13(d), Section 15 or Section 16, as
applicable.      (ii) Prior to the close of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date, shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of, or other securities issuable upon conversion of, any shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock
or other securities issuable upon conversion (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock and/or other securities issuable upon
conversion), by virtue of holding shares of Series L Preferred Stock.      (iii) The Person or Persons entitled to receive the
Common Stock and/or other securities issuable upon conversion of Series L Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock and/or such other securities as of the close of business on the
Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date except to the extent that all or a portion of such Common Stock is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 18. In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice
designate the name in which shares of Common Stock and/or cash, other securities or other property (including payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Series L Preferred Stock should be
registered or paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Corporation shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the
Corporation through book-entry transfer through the Depositary.      (iv) Conversion into shares of Common Stock will occur on
the Mandatory Conversion Date or any applicable Conversion Date as follows:      (A) On the Mandatory Conversion
Date or applicable Conversion Date, certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered to Holders or their designee upon presentation and surrender of the certificate evidencing
the Series L Preferred Stock to the Conversion Agent if shares of the Series L Preferred Stock are held in certificated form, and, if required, the furnishing of appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the payment of all transfer and
similar taxes. If a Holder s interest is a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing Series L Preferred Stock, a book-entry transfer through the Depositary will be made by the Conversion Agent upon compliance with the
Depositary s procedures for converting a beneficial interest in a global security.      (B) On the date of
any conversion at the option of Holders pursuant to Section 12, Section 13(c) or Section 13(d), if a Holder s interest is in certificated form, a Holder must do each of the following in order to convert:   
  (1) complete and manually sign the conversion notice provided by the Conversion Agent, or a facsimile of the conversion
notice, and deliver this irrevocable notice to the Conversion Agent;   
         -12-

(2) surrender the shares of Series L Preferred Stock to the Conversion
Agent;      (3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;   
  (4) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes; and   
  (5) if required, pay funds equal to any declared and unpaid dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date.
     If a Holder s interest is a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing Series L Preferred Stock, in order
to convert a Holder must comply with clauses (3) through (5) listed above and comply with the Depositary s procedures for converting a beneficial interest in a global security.   
  The date on which a Holder complies with the procedures in this clause (v) is the  Conversion Date.    
  (C) Conversion Agent shall, on a Holder s behalf, convert the Series L Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock
and/or cash, other securities or other property (involving payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares), in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by such Holder described in clause (B) above. If a Conversion Date on which a
Holder elects to convert Series L Preferred Stock is prior to the Record Date relating to any declared dividend for the Dividend Period, such Holder will not have the right to receive any declared dividends for that Dividend Period. If a Conversion
Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series L Preferred Stock or the Mandatory Conversion Date is after the Record Date for any declared dividend and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, such Holder shall receive that dividend on the relevant
Dividend Payment Date if such Holder was the Holder of record on the Record Date for that dividend. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Conversion Date is after the Record Date and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, whether or not such
Holder was the Holder of record on the Record Date, the Holder must pay to the Conversion Agent upon conversion of the shares of Series L Preferred Stock an amount in cash equal to the full dividend actually paid on the Dividend Payment Date for the
then-current Dividend Period on the shares of Series L Preferred Stock being converted, unless the Holder s shares of Series L Preferred Stock are being converted pursuant to Section 13(b), Section 13(c) or Section 13(d).
     (b)  Mandatory Conversion at the Corporation s Option .   
  (i) On or after March 15, 2013, the Corporation may, at its option, at any time or from time to time, cause some or all of the
Series L Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Applicable Conversion Rate if, for 20 Trading Days during any period of 30 consecutive Trading Days, including the last Trading Day of such period, the Closing Price of the
Common Stock exceeds 130% of the Applicable Conversion Price of the Series L Preferred Stock. The Corporation will provide Notice of Mandatory Conversion as set forth in Section 13(b)(iii) within three Trading Days after the end of the 30
consecutive Trading Day period.      (ii) If the Corporation elects to cause less than all of the Series L Preferred Stock to be
converted under clause (i) above, the Conversion Agent will select the Series L Preferred Stock to be converted by lot, or on a  pro rata  basis or by another method the Conversion Agent considers fair and appropriate, including any method
required by the Depositary (so long as such method   
         -13-

is not prohibited by the rules of any stock exchange or quotation association on which the Series L Preferred Stock is then traded or quoted). If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a
Holder s Series L Preferred Stock for partial conversion at the Corporation s option and such Holder converts a portion of its shares of Series L Preferred Stock at the same time, the portion converted at such Holder s option will
reduce the portion selected for conversion at the Corporation s option under this Section 13(b).      (iii) If the
Corporation exercises the optional conversion right described in this Section 13(b), the Corporation shall give notice (such notice a   Notice of Mandatory Conversion  ) by (i) providing a notice of such conversion by first
class mail to each Holder of record for the shares of Series L Preferred Stock to be converted or (ii) issuing a press release and making this information available on its website. The Conversion Date shall be a date selected by the
Corporation (the   Mandatory Conversion Date  ), not less than 10 days, and not more than 20 days, after the date on which the Corporation provides the Notice of Mandatory Conversion. In addition to any information required by
applicable law or regulation, the Notice of Mandatory Conversion shall state, as appropriate:      (A) the
Mandatory Conversion Date;      (B) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each
share of Series L Preferred Stock; and      (C) the aggregate number of shares of Series L Preferred Stock to be
converted.      (c)  Conversion upon Make-Whole Acquisition .   
  (i) In the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition occurring prior to a Mandatory Conversion Date or Conversion Date, each Holder shall have
the option to convert its shares of Series L Preferred Stock (a   Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion  ) during the period (the   Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Period  ) beginning on the effective date of the
Make-Whole Acquisition (the   Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date  ) and ending on the date that is 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date and receive an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the
  Make-Whole Shares  ) as set forth in clause (ii) below.      (ii) The number of Make-Whole Shares per share
of Series L Preferred Stock shall be determined by reference to the table below for the applicable Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date and the applicable Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price:   
    Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price         
 
         -14-

(A) The exact Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices and Make-Whole
Acquisition Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table, in which case:      (1) if the Make-Whole
Acquisition Stock Price is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts in the table or the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by straight-line
interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts and the two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;   
  (2) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is in excess of $502.26 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 14), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock; and   
  (3) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than $120.54 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 14), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock.      (B)
The Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices set forth in the table above are subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 14 hereof and shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Make-Whole Acquisition Stock
Prices will equal the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Make-Whole
Acquisition Stock Prices adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. Each of the number of Make-Whole Shares in the table shall also be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant
to Section 14.      (iii) On or before the twentieth day prior to the date the Corporation anticipates being the effective
date for the Make-Whole Acquisition or within two business days of becoming aware of a Make-Whole Acquisition of the type set forth in clause (a) of the definition Make-Whole Acquisition, a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the
Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain:      (A) the anticipated effective date or effective date of the Make-Whole Acquisition; and      (B) the date, which shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, by which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion must be exercised.   
  (iv) On the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, another written notice shall be sent by or on
behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain:   
  (A) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date;   
         -15-

(B) the number of Make-Whole Shares;   
  (C) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by a Holder of Series L Preferred Stock upon
conversion; and      (D) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection
with such Make-Whole Acquisition.      (v) To exercise a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a Holder must, no later than
5:00 p.m., New York City time on or before the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under clause (iv) above, comply with the procedures set forth in
Section 13(a)(iv)(B).      (vi) If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option in
accordance with the provisions specified in this Section 13(c), the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or successor security held by it shall remain outstanding (unless otherwise converted as provided herein), and the Holder will not be
eligible to receive Make-Whole Shares.      (vii) Upon a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion, the Conversion Agent shall, except as
otherwise provided in the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation or its successor as set forth in Section 13(a)(iv) above, deliver to the Holder such cash, securities or other property as
are issuable with respect to Make-Whole Shares in the Make-Whole Acquisition.      (viii) In the event that a Make-Whole
Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Series L Preferred Stock or a successor security representing less than all the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or a successor security held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole
Acquisition Conversion the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation or its successors, a
certificate evidencing the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or such successor security held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion was not effected.      (d)  Conversion Upon Fundamental Change .      (i) If the Reference Price in
connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition is less than $120.54 (a   Fundamental Change  ), a Holder may elect to convert each share of Series L Preferred Stock during the period beginning on the effective date of the Fundamental Change
and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change at an adjusted conversion price equal to the greater of (1) the Reference Price and (2) $60.27, subject to adjustment as described in clause
(ii) below (the   Base Price  ). If the Reference Price is less than the Base Price, Holders will receive a maximum of 16.5916 shares of Common Stock per share of Series L Preferred Stock converted, subject to adjustment as
a result of any adjustment to the Base Price described in clause (ii) below.      (ii) The Base Price shall be adjusted as
of any date the Conversion Rate of the Series L Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to Section 14. The adjusted Base Price shall equal the Base Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Conversion Rate adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.   
         -16-

(iii) In lieu of issuing Common Stock upon conversion in the event of a Fundamental Change,
the Corporation may at its option, and if it obtains any necessary regulatory approval, pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the Reference Price for each share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon conversion.   
  (iv) On or before the twentieth day prior to the date the Corporation anticipates being the effective date for the Fundamental Change or
within two business days of becoming aware of the Fundamental Change if it is a Make-Whole Acquisition of the type set forth in clause (a) of the definition Make-Whole Acquisition, a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the
Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain:      (A) the anticipated effective date of the Fundamental Change; and   
  (B) the date, which shall be 30 days after the anticipated effective date of a Fundamental Change, by which a Fundamental
Change conversion must be exercised.      (v) On the effective date of a Fundamental Change or as soon as practicable thereafter,
another written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain:   
  (A) the date that shall be 30 days after the effective date of the Fundamental Change;   
  (B) the adjusted conversion price following the Fundamental Change;   
  (C) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration received by a Holder of Series L Preferred Stock upon
conversion; and      (D) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection
with such Fundamental Change.      (vi) To exercise its conversion option upon a Fundamental Change, a Holder must, no later than
5:00 p.m., New York City time on or before the date by which the conversion option upon the Fundamental Change must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under clause (v) above, comply with the procedures set forth in
Section 13 (a)(v)(B) and indicate that it is exercising the Fundamental Change conversion option.      (vii) If a Holder
does not elect to exercise its conversion option upon a Fundamental Change in accordance with the provisions specified in this Section 13(d), the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or successor security held by it shall remain outstanding
(unless otherwise converted as provided herein) and the Holder will not be eligible to convert its shares pursuant to this Section 13(d).   
         -17-

(viii) Upon a conversion upon a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent shall, except as
otherwise provided in the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation or its successor as set forth in Section 13(a)(iv), deliver to the Holder such cash, securities or other property as are
issuable with respect to the adjusted conversion price following the Fundamental Change.      (ix) In the event that a conversion
upon a Fundamental Change is effected with respect to shares of Series L Preferred Stock or a successor security representing less than all the shares of Series L Preferred Stock or a successor security held by a Holder, upon such conversion the
Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series L
Preferred Stock or such successor security held by the Holder as to which a conversion upon a Fundamental Change was not effected.      Section 14.  Anti-Dilution Adjustments .      (a)  Adjustments . The
Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, under the following circumstances:      (i) The issuance of
Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock (other than in connection with a Reorganization Event), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the
following formula:       CR   1    = CR   0      (OS    1    / OS   0   )       
  where,       

CR0   
      
  =  
        
  the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on the Record Date   
 
   CR  1       
      
  =  
        
  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Record Date   
 
   OS  0       
      
  =  
        
  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date prior to giving effect to such event   
 
   OS  1       
      
  =  
        
  the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after, and solely as a result of, such event   
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a
dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount
(with the amount of any such dividend or distribution equaling the number of such shares being issued multiplied by the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the five consecutive VWAP Trading Days prior to the Ex-Date for such
dividend or distribution) and (2) in the event any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination that is the subject of this Section 14(a)(i) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted,
effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to pay or make such dividend or distribution or effect such subdivision or combination, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or
distribution had not been declared or such subdivision or combination had not been announced.      (ii) The issuance to all
holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants (other than rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan or rights or warrants issued in   
         -18-

connection with a Reorganization Event) entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or
securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
      CR   1    = CR   0      [(OS   0    + X) / (OS   0    + Y)]        where,       

CR  0       
      
  =  
        
  the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on the Record Date   
 
   CR  1       
      
  =  
        
  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Record Date   
 
   OS  0       
      
  =  
        
  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date   
 
   X   
      
  =  
        
  the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants (or upon conversion of such securities)   
 
     Y    
      
  =  
        
  the number of shares equal to the quotient of the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants (or the conversion price for such securities paid upon conversion)
divided by the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the ten consecutive VWAP Trading Days prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the announcement of the issuance of such rights or warrants   
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) in the event that such rights or warrants described in this
Section 14(a)(ii) are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights or warrants, to the Conversion Rate that would
then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared and (2) to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of the Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or
warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of
delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.      In determining the aggregate price payable for such
shares of the Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration (if other than cash, to be determined by the board of directors). If an
adjustment to the Conversion Rate may be required pursuant to this Section 14(a)(ii), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required pursuant to this
Section 14(a)(ii) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 14(a)(ii).      (iii) The dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (excluding
any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above or (a)(iv) below, any dividend or distribution in connection with a Reorganization Event or any spin-off to which the provisions set forth below in this
clause (a)(iii) apply) in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:   
   CR   1    = CR   0      [SP   0    / (SP   0      FMV)]

distributed, applicable to one share of Common Stock   
    However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one
pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Corporation of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation ( i.e.,  a
spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national or regional securities exchange or market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following
formula:       CR   1    = CR   0      [(FMV   0    + MP   0   ) / MP   0   ]

commencing on and including the third VWAP Trading Day after the date on which  ex-distribution trading  commences for such dividend or distribution on the NYSE or such other national or regional exchange or association or over-the-counter
market, or, if not so traded or quoted, the fair market value of the capital stock or similar equity interests distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock as determined by the board of directors

 ex-distribution trading  commences for such dividend or distribution on the NYSE or such other national or regional exchange or association or over-the-counter market on which Common Stock is then traded or quoted   
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this
Section 14(a)(iii) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the
Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate may be required under this Section 14(a)(iii), delivery of any additional shares of Common Stock that
may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Section 14(a)(iii) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this Section 14(a)(iii).   
  (iv) The Corporation makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any regular
cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed $1.8835 in any fiscal   
         -20-

quarter (the   Dividend Threshold Amount  ) and (b) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any its subsidiaries
referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:       CR   1    = CR   0      [SP   0    / (SP   0      C)]       
  where,

  the amount in cash per share equal to (1) in the case of a regular quarterly dividend, the amount the Corporation distributes to holders or pays, less the Dividend Threshold
Amount or (2) in any other case, the amount the Corporation distributes to holders or pays   
    The Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the
Conversion Rate is adjusted; provided that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).   
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 14(a)(iv) is declared but not
so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the board of directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if
such dividend or distribution had not been declared.      (v) The Corporation or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases
of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value (as determined by the board of directors) of any other consideration included
in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the VWAP Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange
offer (the   Expiration Date  ), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:       CR  1    = CR   0      [(FMV + (SP   1      OS   1   ) / (SP    1      OS   0   )]

  =  
      
  the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the ten consecutive VWAP Trading Days commencing with the VWAP Trading Day immediately after the Expiration
Date.   
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Corporation, or one of its subsidiaries, is obligated to purchase
shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate
shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate may be required under this Section 14(a)(v), delivery of any additional
shares of Common Stock that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this Section 14(a)(v) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this
Section 14(a)(v).      (b)  Calculation of Adjustments . All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by
the Corporation to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would
require an increase or decrease of at least one percent;  provided ,  however , that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided
further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made prior to any conversion pursuant to Section 13(b), Section 13(c) or Section 13(d).   
  (c)  When No Adjustment Required .      (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 14, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or
carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing or for the repurchase of Common Stock.      (ii)  Rights Plans . To the
extent that the Corporation has a stockholders  rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock into Common Stock, Holders will receive, in addition to any of Common Stock deliverable and in lieu of any adjustment to the
Conversion Rate, the rights under the stockholders  rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if we distributed to
all holders of Common Stock, shares of the Corporation s Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in Section 14(a)(iii). A further adjustment will occur as described in Section 14(a)(iii), if such rights become
exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or assets, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.   
  (iii) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:   
  (A) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment
of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Corporation and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan;   
         -22-

(B) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to
purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or   
  (C) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable
or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Series L Preferred Stock was first issued.      (iv) No adjustment to the
Conversion Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 14(a)(i) through (v) if Holders may participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the board of directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light
of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction.      (v) No adjustment to the Conversion
Rate need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.      (vi) No adjustment to the Conversion
Rate will be made to the extent that such adjustment would result in the Conversion Price being less than the par value of the Common Stock.      (d)  Record Date . For purposes of this Section 14,  Record Date  means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of the Common
Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for
determination of holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the board of directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).   
  (e)  Successive Adjustments . After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14, any subsequent event requiring
an adjustment under this Section 14 shall cause an adjustment to such Conversion Rate as so adjusted.      (f)  Multiple
Adjustments . For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 14 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a
single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder.      (g)  Other Adjustments . The Corporation may
(but is not required to) make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 14(a)(i) through (v), as the board of directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common
Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.      In addition to the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Corporation from time to time may increase the Conversion
Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 business days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the board of directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the
Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive.   
         -23-

(h)  Notice of Adjustments . Whenever a Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under
Section 14, the Corporation shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Corporation is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) or
within 15 calendar days of the date the Corporation makes an adjustment pursuant to Section 14(g):      (i) compute the
adjusted applicable Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 14 and prepare and transmit to the Conversion Agent an Officers  Certificate setting forth the applicable Conversion Rate, as the case may be, the method of calculation thereof
in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and      (ii) provide a
written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted applicable Conversion
Rate.      (i)  Conversion Agent . The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any
Holder to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the applicable Conversion Rate or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making
the same. The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers  Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 14(h) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or
property, that may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any of the Series L Preferred Stock; and the Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the
Corporation to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a the conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Corporation contained in this
Section 14.      Section 15.  Reorganization Events .   
  (a) In the event of:      (i) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock will be converted into cash, securities, or other property of the
Corporation or another Person;      (ii) any sale, transfer, lease, or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all
of the consolidated assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock will be converted into cash, securities, or other property; or   
  (iii) any reclassification of the Common Stock into securities, including securities other than the Common Stock; or   
  (iv) any statutory exchange of the Corporation s securities with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or
acquisition);   
         -24-

(any such event specified in this Section 15(a), a   Reorganization Event   each share
of Series L Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the types and amounts of securities, cash, and other property that is or was receivable in such
Reorganization Event by a holder of the shares of Common Stock that was not the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an affiliate of such other party in exchange for such Common Stock (such securities, cash, and other property, the
  Exchange Property  ).      (b) In the event that holders of the shares of the Common Stock have the opportunity
to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration that the Holders are entitled to receive upon conversion shall be deemed to be the types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of the holders of
the shares of the Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). On each Conversion Date following a Reorganization Event, the Conversion Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on
such Conversion Date of the securities, cash, or other property received per share of Common Stock, determined as set forth above. The amount of Exchange Property receivable upon conversion of any Series L Preferred Stock in accordance with
Section 12, Section 13(b), Section 13(c) or Section 13(d) hereof shall be determined based upon the then Applicable Conversion Rate.      (c) The above provisions of this Section 15 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 14 shall apply to any shares of Capital Stock of the
Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.      (d) The
Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the type and amount of the cash, securities or other property that
constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 15.   
  Section 16.  Fractional Shares .      (a) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Series L Preferred Stock.      (b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any conversion at the Corporation s option pursuant to Section 13(b) hereof or any conversion at the option
of the Holder pursuant to Section 12, Section 13(c) or Section 13(d) hereof, the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of the Closing Price of the Common Stock determined as
of the second Trading Day immediately preceding the effective date of conversion.      (c) If more than one share of the Series L
Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series L
Preferred Stock so surrendered.      Section 17.  Reservation of Common Stock .   
  (a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for issuance
upon the conversion of shares of Series L Preferred Stock as provided in this Certificate of Designations, free from any preemptive or other similar   
         -25-

rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series L Preferred Stock then outstanding, calculated assuming the
Applicable Conversion Price equals the Base Price, subject to adjustment as described under Section 14. For purposes of this Section 17(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Series L Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.      (b) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims,
security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).      (c) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to
comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority.   
  (d) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, so long as the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any
other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed all the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series L
Preferred Stock;  provided ,  however , that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Series L Preferred Stock into Common
Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series L Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such
time.      Section 18.  Limitations on Beneficial Ownership . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and
subject to the last sentence of this Section 18, no holder of Series L Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock upon conversion pursuant to Section 12 and Section 13 hereof to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such receipt would cause such converting holder to become, directly or indirectly, a  beneficial owner  (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of
more than 9.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. Any delivery of shares of Common Stock upon a purported conversion of Series L Preferred Stock shall be void and have no effect and such shares shall for all purposes continue to
represent outstanding shares of Series L Preferred Stock to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in the converting holder becoming the beneficial owner of more than 9.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at
such time. If any delivery of shares of Common Stock owed to a holder upon conversion of Series L Preferred Stock is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this limitation, the Corporation s obligation to make such delivery shall not be
extinguished and the Corporation shall deliver such shares as promptly as practicable after any such converting holder gives notice to the Corporation that such delivery would not result in it being the beneficial owner of more than 9.9% of the
shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, these limitations on beneficial ownership shall not be applicable to or limit the number of shares of Series L Preferred Stock to be
converted as a result of a mandatory conversion by the Corporation pursuant to Section 13(b).      Section 19.
 Preemptive or Subscription Rights . The Holders of Series L Preferred Stock shall not have any preemptive or subscription rights.

of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided further that the number of authorized shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be increased. All shares of the 2010
ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, and may thereafter be
issued, but not as shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock.      (b) Shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to
a trustee (the  Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan (the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee
or any company with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other
than any successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common
stock, par value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of
Section 4 hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights
pertaining to the Common Stock into which such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the transferee of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder of the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such transfer. Shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the
Company s option. Certificates representing shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of uncertificated 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2010 ESOP Preferred
Stock shall note the foregoing provisions on each 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee
acknowledge in writing that the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be
converted into shares of Common Stock as provided in paragraph   
         - 2 -

(a) of Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such
conversion may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.   
  2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time
to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2, as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times,
dividends payable on shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased
by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other
series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of
2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and
every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all
shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such
holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such
successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as
provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.   
  (c) So long as any shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of
2010 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting
  
         - 3 -

together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one or more of
the following:      (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any
class or series of stock ranking prior to shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
  (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the
amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares
of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers.      (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to
which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the
Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $95.00 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2011
and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2019, as follows:      (1) If the Current
Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is
equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately
following twelve month period equal to $100.00 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day
if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $105.00 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year
  
         - 4 -

listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled
to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to the Base Dividend.       Dividend
Adjustment Table        
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2011, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $40.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$100.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $100.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2012. If on November 30, 2012, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $60.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $105.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $105.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2013. If on November 30, 2013, the Current Market Price of one share
of Common Stock is $40.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $95.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $95.00 dividend to be made on
March 1, 2014.      (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted
Dividend  and  Second Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading
Day  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year
listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.
     (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base
Dividend or to an Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2010. Dividends on shares of the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
cumulative from the date of initial issuance of such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor
less than 15 days preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee   
         - 5 -

thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The
amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.   
  (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any stock of the Company ranking, as to dividends, on
a parity with or junior to the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set apart for such
payment on shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of 2010 ESOP
Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity
as to dividends with 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio
that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash,
property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on 2010 ESOP Preferred
Stock which may be in arrears.      (ii) So long as any shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend
(other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants, or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or any other stock ranking junior to 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and
other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity
with 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed,
purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Company
ranking junior to 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment
of the then current dividend payment period and all past dividend payment periods.      4.  Conversion . Shares of

to be redeemed are surrendered (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).      (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of
such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for
redemption of the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock then being redeemed.   
  (d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   
  (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the date as of which
the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market Value  shall mean, as to shares of
Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment Period. The  Fair
Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the security is to be determined,
as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good   
         - 10 -

faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market Value  of the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph
(c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2010 ESOP
Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the
2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock held by
the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal (together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of
that certain 2010 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about March 26, 2010 between the Company and the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).   
  6.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  (a) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business
combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that
constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with
such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to
such transaction, subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2010 ESOP
Preferred Stock shall be convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.   
  (2) The Company shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then
outstanding shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.      (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed,
reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph
(a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph
(c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2010 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2010   
         - 11 -

ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock,
securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction. However, if
by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the
holders of the 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of
stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such
holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable
upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per
share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.      (c) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing
for any consolidation or merger or similar business combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least fifteen
(15) Business Days before consummation of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the
Company, to receive, upon consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash payment per share of
2010 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value per share of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, as of the last
Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is consummated. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close of
business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of
withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction.      (d) In the event that a Purchase Offer (as defined below) shall have been made and shall be continuing, each holder of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert shares of 2010 ESOP
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price specified in Section 4(c)(iii)(C) hereof until the date the Purchase Offer is terminated, including without limitation because the original Purchase Offer is withdrawn or
because the Purchase Offer has expired and is not renewed, upon notice of such conversion given to the Company not later than the close of business on the date the Purchase Offer terminates (the  Purchase Offer Conversion Period ), unless
the Company or any successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of conversion so given may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the end of the Purchase Offer Conversion Period.   
         - 12 -

For purposes of this paragraph (d), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth
below:      (i)  Beneficial Ownership  shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and  person  shall have the meanings specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.      (ii) A  Purchase Offer  shall have been made when any person (other than the Company or any affiliate of the Company) shall have  commenced  (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase shares of Common Stock, such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined herein) or the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership, of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company.      7.  Liquidation Rights . (a) Upon the
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any
payment or distribution shall be made on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the amount of $1,000.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or
declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution.      (b) Neither the sale of all or
substantially all the property and assets of the Company, nor the merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this Section 7.      (c) After
the payment to the holders of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts provided for in this Section 7, the holders of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining
assets of the Company.      (d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of shares of
2010 ESOP Preferred Stock upon any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
Section 7, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock upon such dissolution,
liquidation, or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are
respectively entitled upon such dissolution, liquidation, or winding up.      (e) Subject to the rights of the holders of the
shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after
payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 7, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the shares of 2010 ESOP
Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred
Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.   
         - 13 -

8.  Ranking . For the purposes of these resolutions, any stock of any series
or class or classes of the Company shall be deemed to rank:      (a) prior to the shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, either

preference or priority to the holders of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock;      (b) on a parity with shares of 2010 ESOP
Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share, or sinking fund provisions, if any, be different from those of 2010 ESOP Preferred
Stock, if the holders of such stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or
liquidation prices, without preference or priority, one over the other, as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock; and      (c) junior to shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall be Common Stock or if the holders of shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of such series or class or classes.   
  9.  Priority of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock . The shares of 2010 ESOP Preferred Stock will rank on a parity, both as to

FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee I of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation
Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at meetings of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000 and February 24, 2009, and by the ESOP Committee pursuant to
the written consent of the ESOP Committee duly adopted on March 15, 2011, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1. On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the
Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:
     RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred
Stock Committee I (the  First Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of Company

to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the First Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the First Committee shall deem necessary or

member of the ESOP Committee, effective April 29, 2009.   
         1   

3. On March 15, 2011, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in the ESOP
Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional,
and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:   
  2011 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and Number of Shares; Restricted Issue .      (a) The
designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided for herein shall be  2011 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2011 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of
authorized shares constituting the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock is 1,200,000, based on an offering price for the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,085.00 per share. Each share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share.
The number of authorized shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized, provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided
further that the number of authorized shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be increased. All shares of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the
status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock.      (b) Shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the  Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan
(the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the
Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any
further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion
of the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special
rights ascribed to shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to the Common Stock into which such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the
transferee of the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such
transfer. Shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option. Certificates representing shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of
uncertificated 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the foregoing provisions on each 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to transferring
record ownership of any uncertificated 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing that the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided in paragraph   
         2   

(a) of Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such
conversion may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.   
  2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time
to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2, as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times,
dividends payable on shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each holder of the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased
by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity
and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other
series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of
2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time such right with respect to such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and
every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.      (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all
shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such
holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such
successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as
provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.   
  (c) So long as any shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent of the holders of the outstanding shares of
2011 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in
person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one or more of the following:   
  (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock
ranking prior to shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or   
         3   

(ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating,
optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders
thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each
case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely
affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.      (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at
or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to
effect such redemption.      3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to
receive, when and as declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $90.00 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base Dividend shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend shall be adjusted,
effective on December 1, 2012 and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2020, as follows:      (1) If the Current Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a
Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of the 2011 ESOP Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $95.00 per share (the  First Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day
if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $100.00 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).      (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year
  
         4   

listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled
to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to the Base Dividend.        Dividend
Adjustment Table         
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2012, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $40.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$95.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $95.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2013. If on November 30, 2013, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $60.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $100.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $100.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2014. If on November 30, 2014, the Current Market Price of one share
of Common Stock is $40.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $90.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $90.00 dividend to be made on
March 1, 2015.      (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted
Dividend  and  Second Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading
Day  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year
listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.
     (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base
Dividend or to an Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2011. Dividends on shares of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
cumulative from the date of initial issuance of such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor
less than 15 days preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by
  
         5   

dividing by four the Base Dividend or the Adjusted Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full
dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.   
  (b)(i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any stock of the Company ranking, as to dividends, on
a parity with or junior to the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set apart for such
payment on shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of 2011 ESOP
Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity
as to dividends with 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio
that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividend, whether payable in cash,
property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on 2011 ESOP Preferred
Stock which may be in arrears.      (ii) So long as any shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend
(other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants, or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or any other stock ranking junior to 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and
other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity
with 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed,
purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Company
ranking junior to 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment
of the then current dividend payment period and all past dividend payment periods.      4.  Conversion . Shares of
2011 ESOP Preferred Stock are convertible from time to time hereafter pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 4 into that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the stated value of each

         8   

(f) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares

  (j) The Company will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or

delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock to be converted and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the
Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.   
  5.  Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price per share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for
redemption, and (y) the Fair Market Value (as that term is defined in paragraph (d) of this Section 5) per share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock on the date fixed for redemption. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the
Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (c) of this Section 5. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock called
  
         9

such shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Company, to be retired as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 1. If the full cumulative dividends have not been paid, or contemporaneously declared and set aside for payment, on
all outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.   
  (b) Unless otherwise required by law, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 will be sent to the holders of 2011
ESOP Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the Company or any transfer agent for the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock by hand delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class mail (postage prepaid) delivered,

ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) whether the redemption price shall be
paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash; (v) in the case of certificated 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of
the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date; and (vii) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised
and the manner in which the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed
for redemption and at the redemption price set forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of certificated 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the certificates for the shares
to be redeemed are surrendered (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).      (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of
such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for
redemption of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock then being redeemed.   
  (d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   
  (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days preceding the date as of which
the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market Value  shall mean, as to shares of
Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment Period. The  Fair
Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value of the security is to be determined,
as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market Value  of the 2011 ESOP Preferred
Stock   
         10   

for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser,
appointed by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in
paragraph (c) of Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2011
ESOP Preferred Stock would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as
payments of principal (together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2011 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about
March 18, 2011 between the Company and the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).   
  6.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  (a) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business
combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into stock of any successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that
constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with
such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to
such transaction, subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2011 ESOP
Preferred Stock shall be convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.   
  (2) The Company shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or similar transaction unless all then
outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.      (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed,
reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph
(a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph
(c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2011 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders   
         11   

of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election
with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such
transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities,
cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities,
cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.   
  (c) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar business
combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least fifteen (15) Business Days before consummation of such
transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such
transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash payment per share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of
(x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value per share of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock, as of the last Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of
Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is consummated. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation

Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred
Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.   
         13

preference or priority to the holders of shares of 2011 ESOP Preferred Stock;      (b) on a parity with shares of 2011 ESOP
Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share, or sinking fund provisions, if any, be different from those of 2011 ESOP Preferred

  2012 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      (Without Par Value)        
       WELLS
FARGO   COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the  Company ), HEREBY CERTIFIES that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the
 Board ) by the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, which authorizes the issuance of not more than 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without par value (the  Preferred Stock ),
and pursuant to authority conferred upon the ESOP Preferred Stock Committee I of the Board (the  ESOP Committee ) in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  General Corporation
Law ) and by the resolutions of the Board set forth herein, the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board at meetings of the Board duly held on January 25, 2000 and February 24, 2009, and by the ESOP Committee pursuant to
the written consent of the ESOP Committee duly adopted on January 9, 2012, in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      1. On January 25, 2000, the Board adopted the following resolutions (the  ESOP Board Resolutions ) appointing the ESOP Committee and delegating to the ESOP Committee the full powers of the
Board, subject to the ESOP Board Resolutions, in all matters relating to issuance of one or more series of Preferred Stock ( ESOP Preferred Stock ) to the trustee on behalf of the Company s 401(k) Plan hereinafter referred to:
     RESOLVED that a committee of one member of the Board of the Company is hereby appointed by the Board as the ESOP Preferred
Stock Committee I (the  First Committee ), which shall have and may exercise the full powers of the Board, subject to these resolutions, to issue from time to time one or more series of ESOP Preferred Stock, including any shares of Company
common stock ($1 2/3 par value) issuable upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock, and in connection therewith, to fix the designations, voting powers, preferences, and all other rights, qualifications and restrictions of such ESOP Preferred Stock,
to sell such ESOP Preferred Stock to the Plan on such terms and conditions and for such purchase price as the First Committee in its discretion shall approve, and to take any and all actions as the First Committee shall deem necessary or

member of the ESOP Committee, effective April 29, 2009.   
         1   

3. On January 9, 2012, pursuant to authority conferred upon it by the Board in the ESOP
Board Resolutions, the ESOP Committee adopted the following resolutions by written consent in accordance with Section 141(f) of the General Corporation Law:      RESOLVED that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Company is hereby authorized and the designation, voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional,
and other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, are hereby fixed as follows:   
  2012 ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK      1.  Designation and Number of Shares; Restricted Issue .      (a) The
designation of the series of Preferred Stock, without par value, provided for herein shall be  2012 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock  (hereinafter referred to as the  2012 ESOP Preferred Stock ) and the number of
authorized shares constituting the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock is 940,000, based on an offering price for the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock of $1,094.00 per share. Each share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share.
The number of authorized shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock may be reduced by further resolution duly adopted by the Board or the Securities Committee and by the filing of a certificate pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware stating that such reduction has been so authorized, provided, however, that the authorized number of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be decreased below the then outstanding number of such shares, and provided
further that the number of authorized shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be increased. All shares of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock purchased, redeemed, or converted by the Company shall be retired and canceled and shall be restored to the
status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, and may thereafter be issued, but not as shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock.      (b) Shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee (the  Trustee ) acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan, or any successor to such plan
(the  Plan ). All references to the holder of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any company with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the
Plan. In the event of any transfer of record ownership of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock to any person other than any successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any
further action by the Company or the holder thereof, shall be automatically converted into shares of the common stock, par value $1-2/3 per share, of the Company (the  Common Stock ) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion
of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 4 hereof, and no such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or special
rights ascribed to shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only the powers and rights pertaining to the Common Stock into which such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a conversion, the
transferee of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of such
transfer. Shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock may be certificated or uncertificated, at the Company s option. Certificates representing shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing provisions. In the case of
uncertificated 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, the transfer agent for the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall note the foregoing provisions on each 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock book entry account. The Company may require that, as a condition to
  
         2   

transferring record ownership of any uncertificated 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, the proposed transferee acknowledge in writing that the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to the
foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b) of Section 1, shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock (i)(A) shall be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of
Section 4 hereof, and (B) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 4 hereof and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion may be transferred by the holder thereof as
permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Company upon the terms and conditions provided in Sections 5 and 6(c) hereof.      2.  Voting Rights . No shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have voting rights except such voting rights as may from time to time be required by law and as set forth in this Section 2,
as follows:      (a) Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be in
arrears for such number of dividend periods which shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of the outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive right, voting together as a class with holders of
shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two directors of the Company at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders. At elections for such directors, each
holder of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held (the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share
of Preferred Stock held as may be granted to them). Upon the vesting of such right of such holders, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by
vote of the holders of such outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock (together with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and
are exercisable) as herein set forth. The right of such holders of such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of Preferred Stock ranking on such a parity and upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) to elect members of the Board as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at
which time such right with respect to such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.
     (b) Upon any termination of the right of the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock entitled to vote for directors as
herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by such holders voting as a class shall terminate immediately. If the office of any director elected by such holders voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or otherwise, the remaining director elected by such holders may choose a successor to fill such vacancy, which such successor shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of
which such vacancy occurred. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by such holders voting as a class shall end and the special voting powers vested in such holders as provided in this resolution shall have expired, the number of
directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-Laws of the Company irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this resolution.   
         3   

(c) So long as any shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the consent
of the holders of the outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, by a vote of at least two-thirds of all such outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of
Preferred Stock voting together as a class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at any special or annual meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary to permit, effect or validate any one or more of the following:   
  (i) the authorization, creation or issuance, or any increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any class or series of stock
ranking prior to shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or      (ii) the amendment, alteration or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of any of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of the resolutions set forth in a
Certificate of Designations designating shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof which would materially and
adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock or of the holders thereof; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance of
other series of Preferred Stock, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares of any series of Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends
and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.   
  (d) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would
otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.   
  3.  Dividends . (a)(i) Holders of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the
Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available for payment, an annual cash dividend of $100.00 (the  Base Dividend ) per share, which Base Dividend shall be subject to adjustment from time to
time as provided in this Section 3.      (ii) The Base Dividend shall be adjusted, effective on December 1, 2013
and on each December 1 thereafter until December 1, 2021, as follows:      (1) If the Current
Market Price (as hereinafter defined) of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or the next preceding Trading Day (as hereinafter defined) if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is
equal to or greater than the First Target Price but less than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of   
         4   

shares of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $105.00 per share (the  First Adjusted
Dividend ).      (2) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or
the next preceding Trading Day if November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is equal to or greater than the Second Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then holders of shares of
2012 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to $110.00 per share (the  Second Adjusted Dividend ).   
  (3) If the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on November 30 (or next preceding Trading Day if
November 30 is not a Trading Day) of any year listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table below is less than the First Target Price shown opposite that year in such table, then the holders of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock will be entitled to
receive a cash dividend for the immediately following twelve month period equal to the Base Dividend.   
         5   

Dividend Adjustment Table     
   
    (4) As an example of the adjustments described in subparagraphs (1) through
(3) above, if on November 30, 2013, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $30.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal
$105.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $105.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2014. If on November 30, 2014, the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock is $40.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately
following twelve month period per share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $110.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $110.00 dividend to be made on March 1, 2015. If on November 30, 2015, the Current Market Price of one share
of Common Stock is $30.00, then the cash dividend payable for the immediately following twelve month period per share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock would equal $100.00, with the first quarterly payment of such $100.00 dividend to be made on
March 1, 2016.      (5) For purposes of this Section 3, the terms  First Adjusted
Dividend  and  Second Adjusted Dividend  are sometimes referred to as an  Adjusted Dividend;  the term  Current Market Price  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(iv); and the term  Trading
Day  shall have the meaning given to it in Section 4(c)(vi).      (iii) If one share of Common Stock in any year
listed in the Dividend Adjustment Table shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the First Target Price and the Second Target Price listed in such table for that year and each subsequent year will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.
     (iv) Dividends payable on shares of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock (whether such dividends are equal to the Base
Dividend or to an Adjusted Dividend) shall be payable quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2012. Dividends on shares of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock will be
cumulative from the date of initial issuance of such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable, in arrears, to holders of record as they appear on the stock books of the Company on such record dates, not more than 30 days nor
less than 15 days preceding the payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof. The amount of dividends payable per share for each dividend period shall be computed by dividing by four the Base Dividend
or the Adjusted Dividend, whichever is then applicable. The amount of dividends payable for the initial dividend period or any period shorter than a full dividend period shall be calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months.   
         6   

(b) (i) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any
stock of the Company ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof has been set apart for such payment on shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as
aforesaid, upon the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and any other series
of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock shall in all
cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Holders of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to
any dividend, whether payable in cash, property, or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend
payment or payments on 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.      (ii) So long as any shares of 2012 ESOP
Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants, or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or any other stock ranking junior to 2012 ESOP Preferred
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and other than as provided in paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 3) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Common Stock or any other capital stock
of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor shall any Common Stock or any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock
as to dividends or upon liquidation be redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Company (except by
conversion into or exchange for stock of the Company ranking junior to 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation), unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall
have been paid or declared and set aside for payment of the then current dividend payment period and all past dividend payment periods.      4.  Conversion . Shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock are convertible from time to time hereafter pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 4 into
that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the stated value of each share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock by the then applicable Conversion Price, (as determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(iii) of this
Section 4), as follows:      (a) Each share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock released from the unallocated reserve of the
Plan in accordance with the terms thereof shall be automatically converted, without any further action by the Company or the holder thereof, as of the date such release occurs (the  Release Date ), into fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Price for the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock provided for in paragraph (c) of this Section 4.   
         7   

(b) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 4, a holder
of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled at any time, prior to the close of business on the date fixed for redemption of such shares pursuant to Sections 5 or 6 hereof, to cause any or all of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock held by
such holder to be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the then applicable Conversion Price for 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock provided for in paragraph (c) of this Section 4.   
  (c) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   
  (i) The  Average Current Market Price  per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the
Current Market Price for one share of Common Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day occurring prior to the date the  Purchase Offer  is made (as that term is defined in Section 6(d) hereof).
     (ii) A  Business Day  means each day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a day on which state or federally
chartered banking institutions in the State of New York are not required to be open.      (iii) (A) For purposes of a
mandatory conversion of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, the  Conversion Price  for such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be

  (f) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of

to such effective date. The Company shall not be obligated to pay any dividends which shall have accrued or have been declared and shall be payable to holders of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock if the date on which such dividends are paid is on

     (h) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely
for issuance upon the conversion of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from any preemptive rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of 2012
ESOP Preferred Stock then outstanding.      (i) The Company will use its best efforts to cause the listing of the shares of

delivery.      (j) The Company will pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect
of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversions of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock to be converted and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has
paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.   
         10   

5.  Redemption At the Option of the Company . (a) The 2012 ESOP
Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price per share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued
and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, and (y) the Fair Market Value (as that term is defined in paragraph (d) of this Section 5) per share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock on the date fixed for redemption.
Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the Company in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as permitted by paragraph (c) of this Section 5. From and after the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of
2012 ESOP Preferred Stock called for redemption will cease to accrue and all rights in respect of such shares of the Company shall cease, except the right to receive the redemption price. Upon payment of the redemption price, such shares shall be
deemed to have been transferred to the Company, to be retired as provided in paragraph (a) of Section 1. If the full cumulative dividends have not been paid, or contemporaneously declared and set aside for payment, on all outstanding
shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5.      (b) Unless otherwise required by law, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Section 5 will be sent to the holders of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of the
Company or any transfer agent for the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock by hand delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class mail (postage prepaid) delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may be, not less than twenty
(20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the total number of shares of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all
the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) whether the redemption price shall be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a
combination of such Common Stock and cash; (v) in the case of certificated 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on
the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date; and (vii) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised and the manner in which the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock will be determined. The Company shall redeem shares so called for redemption and not previously converted at the date fixed for redemption and at the redemption price set
forth in this Section 5, provided that, in the case of certificated 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the redemption price until the certificates for the shares to be redeemed are surrendered (properly
endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall so require and the notice shall so state).   
  (c) The Company, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred
Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such Common Stock and cash, any such shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section 5) or
their Current Market Price, in either case as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, whichever value will result in the issuance of the greater number of shares of Common Stock to the holder of the 2012 ESOP Preferred
Stock then being redeemed.   
         11   

(d) For purposes of these resolutions, the following terms shall have the meanings set
forth below:      (i)  Adjustment Period  shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days
preceding the date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.      (ii)  Fair Market
Value  shall mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any other issue which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of
the Adjustment Period. The  Fair Market Value  of any security which is not publicly traded (other than the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock) or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof on the date as of which the Fair Market Value
of the security is to be determined, as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board or a committee thereof. The  Fair Market
Value  of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock for purposes of paragraph (a) of Section 5, and for purposes of paragraph (c) of Section 6 shall mean the fair market value thereof determined by an independent appraiser, appointed by
the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, as of the date fixed for redemption of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock (in the case of a redemption pursuant to Section 5) or as of the date specified in paragraph (c) of
Section 6 (in the case of a redemption under that section). For purposes of determining the Fair Market Value of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, the independent appraiser shall assume (i) that all dividends on the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock
would have been paid when due, and (ii) that the mandatory conversion of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock held by the Plan into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof would have occurred when and as payments of principal
(together with accrued interest thereon) would have been made by the Trustee of the Plan in accordance with the terms of that certain 2012 ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Note Agreement dated on or about January 12, 2012 between the
Company and the Plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto).      6.  Consolidation, Merger,
etc.  (a) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or
converted solely into stock of any successor or resulting corporation (including the Company) that constitutes  qualifying employer securities  with respect to a holder of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock within the meaning of Section 409(1)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with such consolidation, merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and shall become Preferred Stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in
respect of such corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 5 and 6 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereon, that the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction, subject to the following:      (1) After such transaction each share of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section 4 hereof, into the number and kind of
qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction.   
         12   

(2) The Company shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or
similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting corporation as aforesaid.      (b) If the Company consummates any consolidation or merger or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed,
reclassified or converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph
(a) of this Section 6) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph
(c) of this Section 6), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2012 ESOP
Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the
aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to
such transaction. However, if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transaction, which election cannot
practicably be made by the holders of the 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, then the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for
the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to
such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction. If the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or
other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and
amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares.      (c) In the event the Company shall enter into
any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar business combination described in paragraph (b) of this Section 6 (a  Business Combination ), then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any
event at least fifteen (15) Business Days before consummation of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right to elect, by
written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, a cash
payment per share of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock equal to the higher of (x) $1,000.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of consummation of such transaction or (y) the Fair Market Value per share of 2012 ESOP Preferred
Stock, as of the last Business Day (as defined in paragraph (c) of Section 4 hereof) immediately preceding the date the Business Combination is consummated. No such   
         13   

notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the
successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to
consummation of such transaction.      (d) In the event that a Purchase Offer (as defined below) shall have been made and
shall be continuing, each holder of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall have the right to convert shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price specified in Section 4(c)(iii)(C) hereof until the date the
Purchase Offer is terminated, including without limitation because the original Purchase Offer is withdrawn or because the Purchase Offer has expired and is not renewed, upon notice of such conversion given to the Company not later than the close of
business on the date the Purchase Offer terminates (the  Purchase Offer Conversion Period ), unless the Company or any successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of conversion so given may be withdrawn by notice
of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the end of the Purchase Offer Conversion Period.      For purposes of this paragraph
(d), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:      (i)  Beneficial Ownership  shall have the
meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and  person  shall have the meanings specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.   
  (ii) A  Purchase Offer  shall have been made when any person (other than the Company or any affiliate of the Company)
shall have  commenced  (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase shares of Common Stock, such that, upon consummation of such offer, such person would have Beneficial
Ownership (as defined herein) or the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the Company.      7.  Liquidation Rights . (a) Upon the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be
paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment or distribution shall be made on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the
amount of $1,000.00 per share, plus a sum equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution.   
  (b) Neither the sale of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, nor the merger or consolidation of the
Company into or with any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of this
Section 7.      (c) After the payment to the holders of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock of the full preferential
amounts provided for in this Section 7, the holders of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.   
         14   

(d) In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to the holders of
shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock upon any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this Section 7, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock upon such
dissolution, liquidation, or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity
shares are respectively entitled upon such dissolution, liquidation, or winding up.      (e) Subject to the rights of the
holders of the shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the
Company, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 7, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior to the shares of
2012 ESOP Preferred Stock upon liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the shares of 2012 ESOP
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.      8.  Ranking . For the purposes of these resolutions,
any stock of any series or class or classes of the Company shall be deemed to rank:      (a) prior to the shares of 2012 ESOP
Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if the holders of such series or class or classes shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as
the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock;      (b) on a parity with
shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share, or sinking fund provisions, if any, be different from those of
2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, if the holders of such stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective
dividend rates or liquidation prices, without preference or priority, one over the other, as between the holders of such stock and the holders of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock; and   
  (c) junior to shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall be Common Stock
or if the holders of shares of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders
of shares of such series or class or classes.      9.  Priority of 2012 ESOP Preferred Stock . The shares of 2012

(d)  
  If prior to the Determination Date you have a Separation from Service that constitutes a Retirement under the Plan, the Final Award Number of Performance Shares under
this Award Agreement (and any Performance Shares with respect to dividend equivalents as provided below) will vest upon the Determination Date and will be distributed to you (or your Beneficiary if you have died before such distribution) in shares
of Common Stock on  [applicable date]  provided that beginning immediately after you cease to be an Employee and continuing until the vesting date you satisfy each of the following conditions ( vesting conditions ): (i) you
comply with the terms of the attached Wells Fargo Agreement Regarding Trade Secrets, Confidential Information, and Non-Solicitation, which agreement is incorporated by reference herein, (ii) you do not express any derogatory or damaging
statements about the Company or any Affiliate, the management or the board of directors of the Company or any Affiliate, the products, services or the business condition of the Company or any Affiliate in any public way or to anyone who could make
those statements public, and (iii) you do not perform services as an officer, director, employee, consultant or otherwise for any business which is in competition with any line of business of the Company or any Affiliate for which you had
executive responsibilities while you were employed by the Company or any Affiliate (including predecessors thereof) and which does business in any location in the geographic footprint of the Company or any Affiliate in which you had executive
responsibilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you die following your Retirement and prior to  [end of Performance Period or other applicable date]  and have satisfied the vesting conditions set forth above through your date of death, the
Target Award Number of Performance Shares under this Award Agreement after giving effect to any Net Operating Loss adjustments determined in accordance with Exhibit A for any years in the Performance Period completed prior to the year in which you
die (and any Performance Shares with respect to dividend equivalents as provided below) will immediately vest and will be distributed to your Beneficiary in accordance with paragraph 3(a) above.

  If you incur a Separation from Service other than for a reason described in paragraph 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) or 3(d), or you fail to comply with any applicable vesting
condition (including the vesting conditions set forth in paragraph 3(d)), any then unvested Performance Shares awarded hereby (including any Performance Shares with respect to dividend equivalents as provided below) will immediately terminate
without notice to you and will be forfeited. For avoidance of doubt, a  Separation from Service other than for a reason described in paragraph 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) or 3(d)  includes, without limitation, a voluntary Separation from Service that
does not constitute a Retirement and an involuntary Separation from Service for Cause.

   Dividend Equivalents . [During the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the date the Performance Shares vest or terminate, whichever occurs first, if
the Company pays a dividend on the Common Stock, you will automatically receive, as of the payment date for such dividend, dividend equivalents in the form of additional Performance Shares based on the amount or number of shares that would have been
paid on the Final Award Number of Performance Shares (or the NOL Adjusted Target Award Number of Performance Shares as applicable under paragraphs 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d))  [other base amount]  had they been issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock as of the record date and, if a cash dividend, the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the dividend payment date. You will also automatically receive dividend equivalents with respect to the additional
Performance Shares, to be determined in the same manner. Performance Shares granted with respect to dividend equivalents will be subject to the same vesting schedule and conditions as the underlying Performance Shares and will be distributed in
shares of Common Stock when, and if, the underlying Performance Shares are settled and distributed.] [During the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the date the Performance Shares vest or terminate, whichever occurs first, if the
Company pays a cash dividend on the Common Stock, you will receive cash payments based on and payable at approximately the same time as the cash dividend that would have been paid on the  [applicable base amount]  had they been issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date for the dividend. Cash payments will be net of federal, state and local withholding taxes.] [During the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the date the Performance Shares vest

10.  
   No Employment Agreement.  Neither the award to you of the Performance Shares nor the delivery to you of this Award Agreement or any other document relating to the
Performance Shares will confer on you the right to continued employment with the Company or any Affiliate. You understand that your employment with the Company or any Affiliate is  at will  and nothing in this document changes, alters or
modifies your  at will  status or your obligation to comply with all policies, procedures and rules of the Company, as they may be adopted or amended from time to time.

Wells Fargo elects not to enforce such restriction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified only to the extent necessary to render that provision valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the invalid or unenforceable provision cannot be, or is not, modified, that provision shall be severed from the Award Agreement and all other provisions shall remain valid and enforceable.

WELLS FARGO   COMPANY    
   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN        PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT         Exhibit A to Performance Share
Award Agreement        This Exhibit A sets forth the manner in which the Final Award Number will be determined.   
   Definitions       Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein (including, but not limited to, Return on Realized Common Equity) shall have the same meanings assigned to them in the Plan and the Award Agreement. In addition, the following terms used in the text of this Exhibit A shall have
the meanings set forth below:       Average Return on Realized Common Equity  means for each of the Financial Performance
Group Companies the sum of such company s Return on Realized Common Equity for each of the 12-month periods ending  [applicable dates during the Performance Period or during other applicable period] , which sum is then divided by
 [applicable divisor] .       Company Return on Realized Common Equity Ranking  means the rank of the Company s
Average Return on Realized Common Equity relative to the Average Return on Realized Common Equity achieved by each of the other Financial Performance Group Companies.       Final Award Number Percentage  means the  Final Award Number Percentage  determined in accordance with the Determination of Final Award Number section of this Exhibit A.   
   Financial Performance Group Companies  means, in addition to the Company, the companies listed below provided that any such
company for which financial data as of  [end of Performance Period or other applicable date] , is not publicly available shall be eliminated as a Financial Performance Group Company.   
   [Financial Performance Group Companies]        Net Operating Loss  means for any year in the Performance Period a loss that results from adjusting a net loss as reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements to eliminate
the effect of the following items, each determined based on generally accepted accounting principles: (1) losses resulting from discontinued operations; (2) extraordinary losses; (3) the cumulative effect of changes in generally
accepted accounting principles; and (4) any other unusual or infrequent loss which is separately identified and quantified.   
    Determination of Final Award Number         Net Operating Loss Adjustments . If the Company incurs a Net Operating Loss for any year in the Performance Period, the Target Award Number will be reduced by one-third for each such year, effective
upon certification by the Committee of a Net Operating Loss for such year. The Target Award Number after giving effect to each such Net Operating Loss adjustment is referred to herein as the  NOL Adjusted Target Award Number.  If the
Company does not incur a Net Operating Loss in any year in the Performance Period, your NOL Adjusted Target Award Number will be the same as your Target Award Number.       RORCE Adjustment . The NOL Adjusted Target Award Number will be adjusted upward or downward depending on the Company Return on Realized Common Equity Ranking in accordance with the chart below to
calculate your Final Award Number of Performance Shares. The Final Award Number of Performance Shares will be determined by multiplying (i) the Final Award Number Percentage by (ii) your NOL Adjusted Target Award Number.

the total number of Performance Shares that will be distributed to you upon settlement.       [alternative performance criteria and/or
adjustments to determine Final Award Number of Performance Shares]        Committee Determination    
  The Committee shall determine the Final Award Number of Performance Shares after the end of the Performance Period and not later than  [applicable
date]  and the date the Committee makes such determination is referred to in this Award as the  Determination Date.  The Committee shall make all determinations in calculating the Final Award Number of Performance Shares and the

      A  Separation from Service  occurs upon your death, retirement or other termination of employment or other event that qualifies
as a  separation from service  under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the applicable regulations thereunder as in effect from time to time. The Company shall determine in each case when a Separation from Service has occurred,
which determination shall be made in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). The Company shall determine that a Separation from Service has occurred as of a certain date when the facts and circumstances indicate that
the Company (or an Affiliate, if applicable) and you reasonably anticipate that, after that date, you will render no further services, or your level of bona fide services (either as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to
a level that is 20% or less than the average level of your bona fide services (either as an employee or independent contractor) previously in effect for you over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or your entire period of service, if you
have been providing services for less than 36 months).      The following presumptions shall also apply to all such determinations:   

(1)  
   Transfers . A Separation from Service has not occurred upon your transfer of employment from the Company to an Affiliate or vice versa, or from an Affiliate to
another Affiliate.         

(2)

result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, and you have not returned to employment with the Company or an Affiliate, a Separation from Service has occurred on the earlier of: (A) the first
day on which you would not be considered  disabled  under any disability policy of the Company or Affiliate under which you are then receiving a benefit; or (B) the first day on which your medical leave of absence period exceeds 29
months.         

(3)  
   Military leave of absence . Where you have a military leave of absence, and you have not returned to employment with the Company or an Affiliate, a Separation
from Service has occurred on the day next following the last day on which you are entitled to reemployment rights under USERRA.

(5)  
   Other leaves of absence . In the event that you are on a bona fide leave of absence, not otherwise described in this definition, from which you have not returned
to employment with the Company or an Affiliate, your Separation from Service has occurred on the first day on which your leave of absence period exceeds six months or, if earlier, upon your termination of employment (provided that such termination
of employment constitutes a Separation from Service in accordance with the last sentence of the first paragraph of this definition).         

(6)  
   Asset purchase transaction . If, in connection with the sale or other disposition of substantial assets (such as a division or substantially all assets of a trade
or business) of the Company or an Affiliate to an unrelated buyer, you become an employee of the buyer or an affiliate of the buyer upon the closing of or in connection with such transaction, a Separation from Service has not occurred if the Company
and the buyer have specified that such transaction will not, with respect to any individual affected by such transaction who becomes an employee of the buyer or an affiliate, be considered a  separation from service  under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), and such specification meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(4).         Specified Employee       A  Specified Employee  means:   

(1)  
  Any Participant who is a  key employee  under Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii) or (iii) (applied in accordance with the
regulations thereunder and disregarding Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i)(5)) at any time during the 12-month period ending on the specified employee identification date. For purposes of determining  key employee  status under
Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), except as required under such provision and the regulations thereunder, the term  officer  shall refer to an employee of the Company or an Affiliate with the title Senior Vice President
or above, and         

(2)  
  Any participant who served as a member of the Company s Management Committee at any time during the 12-month period ending on the specified employee identification
date.        For purposes of applying Internal Revenue Code section 409A, the  specified employee identification date  is
each December 31. Any person described in (1) or (2) above on a specified employee effective date shall be treated as a Specified Employee for the entire 12-month period beginning on the following April 1.   
  Notwithstanding the above, in the event of a corporate transaction to which the Company or an Affiliate is a party, the Company may, in its discretion,
establish a method for determining Specified Employees pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i)(6).

Wells Fargo Agreement    
   Regarding Trade Secrets, Confidential Information, and Non-Solicitation        I. Introduction       In consideration for the Performance Share Award granted to me by
Wells Fargo   Company on  [applicable grant date] , on the terms and conditions contained in the Performance Share Award Agreement ( Performance Share Award Agreement ), I acknowledge that the nature of my employment with and
performance of services for Wells Fargo   Company and its affiliates (the  Company ) permits me to have access to certain of its trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information and that such information is, and shall
always remain, the sole property of the Company. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of this information would be wrongful and would cause the Company irreparable harm. Therefore, I agree as follows:   
   II. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information       During the course of my employment I have acquired, and will acquire, knowledge of the Company s Trade Secrets and other proprietary information relating to its business, business methods, personnel,
and customers (collectively referenced as  Confidential Information ).  Trade Secrets  are defined as information, including but not limited to, a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process,
that: (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and (2) is the subject of efforts that are
reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. The Company s Trade Secrets include, but are not limited to, the following:       

the names, address, and contact information of the Company s customers and prospective customers, as well as any other personal or financial
information relating to any customer or prospect, including, without limitation, account numbers, balances, portfolios, maturity and/or expiration or renewal dates, loans, policies, investment activities, purchasing practices, insurance, annuity
policies and objectives;          

any information concerning the Company s operations, including without limitation, information related to its methods, services, pricing, costs,
margins and mark-ups, finances, practices, strategies, business plans, agreements, decision-making, systems, technology, policies, procedures, marketing, sales, techniques, agent information and processes;      

any other proprietary and/or confidential information relating to the Company s customers, employees, products, services, sales, technologies, or
business affairs.         I understand that Records of the Company also constitute Confidential Information and that my obligation
to maintain the confidentiality thereof continues at all times during and after my employment.  Records  include, but are not limited to, original, duplicated, computerized, memorized, handwritten or any other form of information, whether
contained in materials provided to me by the Company, or by any institution acquired by the Company, or compiled by me in any form or manner including information in documents or electronic devices, such as software, flowcharts, graphs,
spreadsheets, resource manuals, videotapes, calendars, day timers, planners, rolodexes, or telephone directories maintained in personal computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants or any other device. These records do not become any
less confidential or proprietary to the Company because I may commit some of them to memory or because I may otherwise maintain them outside of the Company s offices.      I agree that Confidential Information of the Company is to be used by me solely and exclusively for the purpose of conducting business on behalf of the Company. I am expected to keep such Confidential
Information confidential and not to divulge,use or disclose this information except for that purpose. If I resign or am terminated from my employment for any reason, I agree to immediately return to the Company all Records and Confidential
Information, including information maintained by me in my office, personal electronic devices, and/or at home.       III. Non-Solicitation of
Company s Employees and Customers       I agree that for the period beginning on my termination date with the Company through the greater
of (i) the period beginning on my termination date through the Determination Date as defined in the Performance Share Award Agreement or (ii) the one-year period following my termination date ( the Non-Solicitation Period ), I
will not do any of the following, either directly or indirectly or through associates, agents, or employees:       

a.  
  solicit, recruit or promote the solicitation or recruitment of any employee or consultant of the Company for the purpose of encouraging that employee or consultant to
leave the Company s employ or sever an agreement for services; or         

b.  
    solicit, participate in or promote the solicitation of any of the Company s clients, customers, or prospective customers with whom I had Material
Contact and/or regarding whom I received Confidential Information, for the purpose of providing products or services ( Competitive Products/Services ).  Material Contact  means

interaction between me and the customer, client or prospective customer within one (1) year prior to my Separation of Service (as defined in the Performance Award Agreement) which takes
place to manage, service or further the business relationship.        This limitation is not intended to limit the Company s
right to prevent misappropriation of its Confidential Information beyond the Non-Solicitation Period.       IV. Assignment of Inventions
      I acknowledge and agree that all inventions and all worldwide intellectual property rights that I make, conceive or first reduce to
practice (alone or in conjunction with others) during my employment with the Company are owned by the Company that (1) relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the Company s business, or actual or
demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company whether or not I made, conceived or first reduced the inventions to practice during normal working hours; and (2) involve the use of any time, material, information, or facility of
the Company.       V. Partial Invalidity       If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the

all applicable federal, state, local, foreign and employment-related taxes in the event all or a portion of the Restricted Share Rights are treated as taxable prior to or other than on the vesting dates set forth in paragraph 2 above and the number
of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable is insufficient to satisfy such tax withholding obligations and employment-related tax requirements.         

6.

   Trade Secrets and Confidential Information.  During the course of your employment, you will acquire knowledge of the Company s and/or any Affiliate s
(collectively  WFC ) Trade Secrets and other proprietary information relating to its business, business methods, personnel, and customers (collectively,  Confidential Information ).  Trade Secrets  means WFC s

and information, and confidentially maintained prospective client and customer lists and information. You agree that Confidential Information of WFC is to be used solely and exclusively for the purpose of conducting business on behalf of WFC. You

otherwise use WFC s Trade Secrets to directly or indirectly solicit, participate in or promote the solicitation of any of WFC s clients, customers, or prospective customers for the purpose of providing products or services that are in
competition with WFC s products or services.     

(b)  
   Assignment of Inventions.  You acknowledge and agree that all inventions and all worldwide intellectual property rights that you make, conceive or first reduce to
practice (alone or in conjunction with others) during your employment with WFC are owned by WFC that (1) relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to WFC s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated

prospective customers with whom you had Material Contact and/or regarding whom you received Confidential Information, for the purpose of providing products or services that are in competition with WFC s products or services.  Material
Contact  means interaction between you and the customer, client or prospective customer within one (1) year prior to your last day as a team member which takes place to manage, service or further the business relationship.
       The one-year limitation is not intended to limit WFC s right to prevent misappropriation of its
Confidential Information beyond the one-year period.

otherwise reimburse WFC an amount having a value equal to the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date of vesting) of such vested shares. This paragraph does not constitute the Company s exclusive remedy for violation of your
restrictive covenant obligations, and WFC may seek any additional legal or equitable remedy, including injunctive relief, for any such violation.]

Exhibit A         [Certain Definitions         Separation from Service    
  A Participant s  Separation from Service  occurs upon his or her death, retirement or other termination of employment or other event that
qualifies as a  separation from service  under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the applicable regulations thereunder as in effect from time to time. The Company shall determine in each case when a Participant s Separation
from Service has occurred, which determination shall be made in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). The Company shall determine that a Separation from Service has occurred as of a certain date when the facts and
circumstances indicate that the Company (or an Affiliate, if applicable) and the Participant reasonably anticipate that, after that date, the Participant will render no further services, or the Participant s level of bona fide services (either
as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to a level that is 20% or less than the average level of the Participant s bona fide services (either as an employee or independent contractor) previously in effect for such
Participant over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the Participant s entire period of service, if the Participant has been providing services for less than 36 months).      The following presumptions shall also apply to all such determinations:       

(1)  
   Transfers . A Separation from Service has not occurred upon the Participant s transfer of employment from the Company to an Affiliate or vice versa, or from
an Affiliate to another Affiliate.         

(2)  
   Medical leave of absence . Where the Participant has a medical leave of absence due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be
expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, and he or she has not returned to employment with the Company or an Affiliate, a Separation from Service has occurred on the earlier of:
(A) the first day on which the Participant would not be considered  disabled  under any disability policy of the Company or Affiliate under which the Participant is then receiving a benefit; or (B) the first day on which the
Participant s medical leave of absence period exceeds 29 months.         

(3)  
   Military leave of absence . Where the Participant has a military leave of absence, and he or she has not returned to employment with the Company or an Affiliate,
a Separation from Service has occurred on the day next following the last day on which the Participant is entitled to reemployment rights under USERRA.         

(4)  
   Salary continuation leave . A Separation from Service has occurred on the first day of the Participant s salary continuation leave taken under the
Company s salary continuation leave program.         

(5)  
   Other leaves of absence . In the event that the Participant is on a bona fide leave of absence, not otherwise described in this definition, from which he or she
has not returned to employment with the Company or an Affiliate, the Participant s Separation from Service has occurred on the first day on which the Participant s leave of absence period exceeds six months or, if earlier, upon the
Participant s termination of employment (provided that such termination of employment constitutes a Separation from Service in accordance with the last sentence of the first paragraph of this definition).     

(6)  
     Asset purchase transaction . If, in connection with the sale or other disposition of substantial assets (such as a division or substantially all
assets of a trade or business) of the Company or an Affiliate to an unrelated buyer, the Participant becomes an employee of the buyer or an affiliate of the buyer upon the closing of or in connection with such transaction, a Separation from Service
has not occurred if the Company and the buyer have specified that such transaction will not, with respect to any individual affected by such transaction who becomes an employee of the buyer or an affiliate, be considered a  separation from
service  under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), and such specification meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(4).      

Specified Employee       A  Specified Employee  means:       

(1)  
  Any Participant who is a  key employee  under Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii) or (iii) (applied in accordance with the
regulations thereunder and disregarding Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i)(5)) at any time during the 12-month period ending on the specified employee identification date. For purposes of determining  key employee  status under
Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), except as required under such provision and the regulations thereunder, the term  officer  shall refer to an employee of the Company or an Affiliate with the title Senior Vice President
or above, and         

(2)  
  Any participant who served as a member of the Company s Management Committee at any time during the 12-month period ending on the specified employee identification
date.        For purposes of applying Internal Revenue Code section 409A, the  specified employee identification date  is
each December 31. Any person described in (1) or (2) above on a specified employee effective date shall be treated as a Specified Employee for the entire 12-month period beginning on the following April 1.   
  Notwithstanding the above, in the event of a corporate transaction to which the Company or an Affiliate is a party, the Company may, in its discretion,
establish a method for determining Specified Employees pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i)(6).       Disability
      You will be considered to have a  Disability  if you are receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than
three months under the Company s long-term disability plan as a result of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12
months.       Cause    
   Cause  means your termination of employment by the Company arising from or on or after (1) the continued failure by you to substantially
perform your duties; (2) your conviction of a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust, conviction of a felony, or commission of any act that makes you ineligible for coverage under Wells Fargo s fidelity bond or otherwise makes you
ineligible for continued employment; or (3) your violation of the Company s policies, including but not limited to Wells Fargo s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Information Security Policies and Compliance and Risk Management
Accountability Policy.       Change in Control        Change in Control  means a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or the Affiliate that employs you, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the
Company or the Affiliate that employs you within the meaning of Treas. Reg. section 1.409A-3(i)(5) as determined by the Company.]      End of Form of Restricted Share Rights Award Agreement      for Grants on or after

  These computations are included herein in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. However, management believes that fixed charge ratios are not
meaningful measures for the business of the Company because of two factors. First, even if there was no change in net income, the ratios would decline with an increase in the proportion of income which is tax-exempt or, conversely, they would
increase with a decrease in the proportion of income which is tax-exempt. Second, even if there was no change in net income, the ratios would decline if interest income and interest expense increase by the same amount due to an increase in the level
of interest rates or, conversely, they would increase if interest income and interest expense decrease by the same amount due to a decrease in the level of interest rates.

     Financial Review          Overview        

Wells Fargo   Company is a diversified financial services company with $1.3 trillion in assets. Founded
in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, insurance, trust and investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, brokerage services and consumer and commercial finance through more than 9,000 stores, 12,000
ATMs, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions across North America and internationally. With approximately 264,000 active, full-time equivalent team members, we serve one in three households in
America and ranked No. 23 on  Fortune s  2011 rankings of America s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and first in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at December 31, 2011.   
  Our vision is to satisfy all our customers  financial needs, help them succeed financially, be recognized as the premier financial
services company in our markets and be one of America s great companies. Our primary strategy to achieve this vision is to increase the number of products our customers utilize and to offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their
needs. Our cross-sell strategy, diversified business model and the breadth of our geographic reach facilitate growth in both strong and weak economic cycles, as we can grow by expanding the number of products our current customers have with us, gain
new customers in our extended markets, and increase market share in many businesses. Our retail bank household cross-sell increased each quarter during 2011 to 5.92 products per household in fourth quarter 2011, up from 5.70 in fourth quarter 2010.
We believe there is more opportunity for cross-sell as we continue to earn more business from our customers. Our goal is eight products per customer, which is approximately half of our estimate of potential demand for an average U.S. household.
Currently, one of every four of our retail banking households has eight or more products.      Our pursuit of growth and earnings
performance is influenced by our belief that it is important to maintain a well controlled operating environment. We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while monitoring and
reviewing the performance of our loan portfolio. We manage the interest rate and market risks inherent in our asset and liability balances

within established ranges, while ensuring adequate liquidity and funding. We maintain strong capital levels to facilitate future growth.   
  Expense management is also important to us, but we approach this in a manner intended to help ensure our revenue is not adversely
affected. Our current company-wide expense management initiative is focused on removing unnecessary complexity and eliminating duplication as a way to improve the customer experience and the work process of our team members. With this initiative and
the completion of Wachovia merger integration activities, we are targeting fourth quarter 2012 noninterest expense of $11 billion. We expect first quarter 2012 noninterest expense to remain elevated because of seasonally higher personnel expenses
and our final quarter of Wachovia integration expenses, partially offset by continued gains from efficiency and cost save initiatives. We expect quarterly total expenses to decline over the rest of 2012, driven by the benefit from ongoing efficiency
initiatives and the conclusion of integration activities. However, quarterly expenses may vary due to cyclical or seasonal factors, among others. In addition, we will continue to invest in our businesses and add team members where appropriate.
      Financial Performance       Our
2011 results were strong despite continued economic volatility during the year, with improved credit quality and lower expenses as well as solid growth in deposits and capital, which funded growth in loans and investment securities. Regulatory
reform and related initiatives also created a difficult environment in which to achieve strong financial performance. For example, changes mandated by Regulation E and related overdraft policy changes implemented in third quarter 2010 decreased our
service charges on deposit accounts. Also, implementation of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act in fourth quarter 2011 reduced debit interchange fees and the mortgage servicing regulatory consent orders that we entered into with our
regulators in April 2011 and other regulatory activities contributed to lowered residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) valuation and increased our estimate of losses for repurchases of serviced loans.

26   

Wells Fargo net income was $15.9 billion and diluted earnings per common share were
$2.82 for 2011, both up 28% from 2010. Our net income growth from 2010 was primarily driven by a lower provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense, which more than offset lower revenues. Net income growth from 2010 included
contributions from each of our three business segments: Community Banking (up 30%); Wholesale Banking (up 19%); and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement (up 28%). Return on average assets was 1.25% for 2011, compared with 1.01% for 2010. Our return on
equity was 11.93% in 2011, up from 10.33% in 2010.      On a year-over-year basis, revenue was down 5% in 2011, predominantly
reflecting decreased interest income on securities available for sale and loans due to lower yields as market rates declined. The decline in revenue was also affected by lower mortgage banking noninterest income as a result of lower originations and
higher servicing-related costs caused by the regulatory consent orders and other mortgage-related regulatory matters as well as lower net gains from trading activities. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by increased interest income on
trading assets and decreased interest expense. Noninterest expense was down 2% from 2010 reflecting the benefit of reduced merger integration costs and lower foreclosed asset expense.   
  We believe loan and deposit growth have positioned us for continued improvement in financial performance. Total loans were $769.6
billion at December 31, 2011, up from $757.3 billion at December 31, 2010, and averaged $757.1 billion for 2011 compared with $770.6 billion for 2010. The net growth in loans from December 31, 2010, included the consolidation of
$5.6 billion of reverse mortgage loans previously sold as well as the purchases with a period end balance of $3.6 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate (CRE), offset by a $21.0 billion decrease in our non-strategic and liquidating
loan portfolios. Our core deposits totaled $872.6 billion at December 31, 2011, up 9% from December 31, 2010, and our average core deposits grew 7% from 2010 to $826.7 billion for 2011. Average core deposits were 109% of average loans
for 2011, up from 100% for 2010. We continued to attract high quality core deposits in the form of checking and savings deposits, which on average totaled $757.0 billion, up 11% from 2010 as we added new customers and deepened our relationships
with existing customers. Average core checking and savings deposits were 92% of average core deposits, up from 89% for 2010.   
  Table 1 provides a six-year summary of selected financial data and Table 2 presents key ratios and per common share data.   
   Credit Quality       As in 2010, we again
experienced credit improvement during 2011 in our loan portfolios with lower net charge-offs and improved or stable delinquency trends. The rate of improvement moderated in some portfolios during the latter half of 2011, consistent with our
expectations at this point in the credit cycle. The improvement in our credit portfolio was due in part to the continued decline in balances in our non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios (primarily from the Wachovia acquisition), which
decreased $21.0 billion

during 2011, and $78.5 billion in total since the beginning of 2009, to $112.3 billion at December 31, 2011.      Reflecting the continued improved credit performance in our loan portfolios, the $7.9 billion provision for credit losses for 2011 was $7.9 billion less than a year ago. The 2011 provision for credit
losses was $3.4 billion less than net charge-offs, compared with $2.0 billion less for 2010. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future allowance releases in 2012, although at more modest levels. Since first quarter 2010 net
charge-offs have decreased every quarter until fourth quarter 2011 when they were essentially flat compared with third quarter 2011. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) have decreased every quarter since their peak in third quarter 2010. Net charge-offs
totaled $11.3 billion for 2011, compared with $17.8 billion for 2010. NPAs decreased to $26.0 billion at December 31, 2011, from $32.3 billion at December 31, 2010. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing (excluding
government insured/guaranteed loans) decreased to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2011, from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010. In addition, our portfolio of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans continued to perform better
than expected at the time of acquisition.       Capital       We continued to build capital in 2011, with total equity up $13.8 billion to $141.7 billion from December 31, 2010. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio grew 116 basis points during 2011 to 9.46% of
risk-weighted assets under Basel I, reflecting strong internal capital generation. Based on our interpretation of current Basel III capital proposals, we estimate that our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 7.50% at the end of 2011. Our other regulatory
capital ratios remained strong with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.33% and Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.03% at December 31, 2011. See the  Capital Management  section in this Report for more information regarding our capital,
including Tier 1 common equity.      During 2011 we redeemed $9.2 billion of trust preferred securities that carried a higher
cost than other funding sources available to us, repurchased approximately 80 million shares of our common stock and entered into two separate $150 million private forward repurchase transactions. The first transaction settled in fourth quarter
2011 for approximately 6 million shares of common stock and the second transaction settled in first quarter 2012 for approximately 6 million shares of common stock. We also paid common stock dividends of $0.12 per share each quarter in
2011.

Earnings Performance    

Wells Fargo net income for 2011 was $15.9 billion ($2.82 diluted earnings per common share) compared with
$12.4 billion ($2.21 diluted earnings per common share) for 2010 and $12.3 billion ($1.75 diluted earnings per common share) for 2009. Our 2011 earnings reflected strong execution of our business strategy in a difficult economic environment. The key
drivers of our financial performance in 2011 were improved credit quality, lower operating costs, diversified sources of fee income, balanced net interest and fee income, a diversified loan portfolio and increased deposits.   
  Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, was $80.9 billion in 2011, compared with $85.2 billion in 2010 and $88.7
billion in 2009. The decline in revenue in 2011 was predominantly due to lower net interest income, mortgage banking and net gains from trading activities. Net interest income of $42.8 billion in 2011, represented 53% of revenue, compared with
$44.8 billion (53%) in 2010 and $46.3 billion (52%) in 2009. The 4% decline in 2011 net interest income from 2010 reflected a 32 basis points decline in the net interest margin and a 2% decline in average loans. The decline in average
loans from 2010 reflected reductions in the non-strategic and liquidating loan

portfolios, partially offset by loan growth and loan acquisitions. Continued success in generating low-cost deposits enabled the Company to grow assets by funding loan and securities growth while
reducing higher cost long-term debt.      Noninterest income was $38.2 billion in 2011, representing 47% of revenue,
compared with $40.5 billion (47%) in 2010 and $42.4 billion (48%) in 2009. The decrease in noninterest income in 2011 was due largely to lower service charges on deposit accounts, net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities and
net gains from trading activities.      Noninterest expense was $49.4 billion in 2011, compared with $50.5 billion in 2010 and
$49.0 billion in 2009. Noninterest expense as a percentage of revenue was 61% in 2011, 59% in 2010 and 55% in 2009. Noninterest expense for 2011 included $1.7 billion of Wachovia merger-related integration expense, compared with $1.9 billion in
2010 and $895 million in 2009.      Table 3 presents the components of revenue and noninterest expense as a percentage of revenue
for year-over-year results.

Earnings Performance    (continued)       

Net Interest Income       Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-earning assets minus the interest paid for deposits, short-term borrowings and
long-term debt. The net interest margin is the average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. Net interest income and the net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent
basis in Table 5 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt loans and securities based on a 35% federal statutory tax rate.      Net interest income and the net interest margin are significantly influenced by the mix and overall size of our earning asset portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, some sources of
interest income, such as loan prepayment fees and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can vary from period to period. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $43.5 billion in 2011, compared with $45.4 billion in 2010 and $47.0
billion in 2009. The net interest margin was 3.94% in 2011, down 32 basis points from 4.26% in 2010 and down 34 basis points from 4.28% in 2009. The decline in net interest income and the net interest margin was largely due to repricing of the
balance sheet as higher-yielding loan and security runoff was partially offset by new loans, investment portfolio purchases and growth in short-term investments. The decline in earning asset income was mitigated by a reduction in funding costs
resulting from disciplined deposit pricing, debt maturities, and redemptions of higher cost trust preferred securities.

Table 4 presents the components of earning assets and funding sources as a percentage of
earning assets and provides an analysis of year-over-year changes that influenced net interest income.      Soft consumer loan
demand and the impact of liquidating certain loan portfolios reduced average loans in 2011 to 69% of average earning assets compared with 72% in 2010. Average short-term investments and trading account assets were 12% of earning assets in 2011 up
from 9% in 2010.      Core deposits are an important low-cost source of funding and affect both net interest income and the net
interest margin. Core deposits include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and other savings, and certain foreign deposits (Eurodollar sweep balances). Average core deposits rose to
$826.7 billion in 2011 from $772.0 billion in 2010 and funded 109% and 100% of average loans, respectively. Average core deposits increased to 75% of average earning assets in 2011, compared with 73% a year ago. The cost of these deposits
declined significantly as the mix shifted from higher cost certificates of deposit to checking and savings products, which were also at lower yields relative to 2010. About 91% of our average core deposits are in checking and savings deposits, one
of the highest percentages in the industry.      Table 5 presents the individual components of net interest income and the net
interest margin. The effect on interest income and costs of earning asset and funding mix changes described above, combined with rate changes during 2011, are analyzed in Table 6.

Earnings Performance    (continued)       

Table 6 allocates the changes in net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to
changes in either average balances or average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period, it is not possible

to precisely allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated to these categories in proportion to the
percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income

  Volume and rate amounts for 2010 over 2009 have been revised to reflect the use of amortized cost as the basis for calculating the change between periods.
    
         36   

Noninterest Income        Table 7: Noninterest Income    
    Noninterest income of $38.2 billion represented 47% of revenue for 2011 compared with $40.5 billion, or 47%, for 2010.
The decrease in noninterest income from 2010 was due largely to lower service charges on deposit accounts, lower net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities and lower net gains from trading activities.   
  Our service charges on deposit accounts decreased in 2011 by $636 million, or 13% from 2010, predominantly due to changes implemented in
third quarter 2010 mandated by Regulation E (which limited certain overdraft fees) and related overdraft policy changes.      We
earn trust, investment and IRA (Individual Retirement Account) fees from managing and administering assets, including mutual funds, corporate trust, personal trust, employee benefit trust and agency assets. At December 31, 2011, these assets
totaled $2.2 trillion, up 5% from $2.1 trillion at December 31, 2010. Trust, investment and IRA fees are largely based on a tiered scale relative to the market value of the assets under management or administration. These fees
increased to $4.1 billion in 2011 from $4.0 billion in 2010.      We receive commissions and other fees for providing
services to full-service and discount brokerage customers as well as from investment banking activities including equity and bond underwriting. These fees increased to $7.2 billion in 2011 from $6.9 billion in 2010. Our commission and other
fees include transactional commissions, which are based on the number of transactions executed at the customer s direction, and

asset-based fees, which are based on the market value of the customer s assets. Brokerage client assets totaled $1.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.      Card fees were $3.7 billion in 2011, essentially flat from 2010. Legislative and regulatory changes enacted in
2010 led to a reduction in card fee income, which was offset by growth in purchase volume and new accounts growth. The final Federal Reserve Board (FRB) rules implementing the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act became effective in October 2011,
placing limits on debit card interchange fees. As a result, debit card interchange fees were reduced by $365 million during fourth quarter 2011 as compared to fees that would have been earned without the limits. We currently expect future
volume, product or account changes may over time mitigate at least half of the earnings reduction resulting from the FRB s debit card interchange rules.      Mortgage banking noninterest income, consisting of net servicing income and net gains on loan origination/sales activities, totaled $7.8 billion in 2011, compared with $9.7 billion in 2010. The reduction
in mortgage banking noninterest income was primarily driven by a decline in net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities as discussed below.      Net mortgage loan servicing income includes both changes in the fair value of MSRs during the period as well as changes in the value of derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge the MSRs. Net servicing
income for 2011 included a $1.6 billion net MSR valuation gain ($3.7 billion decrease in the fair value of the MSRs offset by a $5.3 billion hedge gain) and for 2010 included a $1.5 billion net MSR valuation gain
($3.0 billion decrease in the fair value of MSRs offset by a $4.5 billion hedge gain). See the  Risk Management   Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk  section of this Report for additional information regarding
our MSRs risks and hedging approach. The valuation of our MSRs at the end of 2011 reflected our assessment of expected future levels in servicing and foreclosure costs. See the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management   Risks
Relating to Servicing Activities  section in this Report for information on the regulatory consent orders. Our portfolio of loans serviced for others was $1.85 trillion at December 31, 2011, and $1.84 trillion at
December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the ratio of MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 0.76%, compared with 0.86% at December 31, 2010.      Income from loan origination/sale activities was $4.6 billion in 2011 compared with $6.4 billion in 2010. The decrease in 2011 was driven by lower loan origination volume and margins on loan originations,
partially offset by lower provision for mortgage loan repurchase losses. Residential real estate originations were $357 billion in 2011, compared with $386 billion a year ago, and mortgage applications were $537 billion in 2011, compared
with $620 billion in 2010. The 1-4 family first mortgage unclosed pipeline was $72 billion at December 31, 2011, and $73 billion at December 31, 2010. For additional information, see the  Risk Management   Mortgage
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk  section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

37   

Earnings Performance    (continued)       

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities include the cost of any additions
to the mortgage repurchase liability. Mortgage loans are repurchased from third parties based on standard representations and warranties, and early payment default clauses in mortgage sale contracts. Additions to the mortgage repurchase liability
that were charged against net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities during 2011 totaled $1.3 billion (compared with $1.6 billion for 2010), of which $1.2 billion ($1.5 billion for 2010) was for subsequent increases in estimated losses
on prior year s loan sales. For additional information about mortgage loan repurchases, see the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management   Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses  section and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking
Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.      Net gains from trading activities, which reflect unrealized changes in
fair value of our trading positions and realized gains and losses, were $1.0 billion in 2011 and $1.6 billion in 2010. The year-over-year decrease was driven by challenging market conditions, including sovereign debt concerns, which pressured credit
spreads, reduced prices on financial assets and limited new issue origination and trading opportunities. The decline also reflects a loss of $377 million in 2011 relating to our resolution of a legacy Wachovia position. Net gains from trading
activities do not include interest income and other fees earned from related activities. Those amounts are reported within interest income from trading assets and other noninterest income, respectively, in the income statement. Net gains from
trading activities are primarily from trading conducted on behalf of or driven by the needs of our customers (customer accommodation trading) and also include the results of certain economic hedging and proprietary trading activity. Net gains
(losses) from proprietary trading were a $14 million net loss in 2011 and a $22 million net gain in 2010. Proprietary trading results also included interest and fees reported in their corresponding income statement line items. Proprietary
trading activities are not significant to our client-focused business model. Our trading activities, customer accommodation, economic hedging and proprietary trading are further discussed in the  Asset/Liability Management   Market Risk
  Trading Activities  section in this Report.      Net gains on debt and equity securities totaled $1.5 billion for
2011 and $455 million for 2010, after other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) write downs of $711 million for 2011 and $940 million for 2010. Included in net gains on debt and equity securities for 2011 was a $271 million gain related to a legacy
Wachovia position, due to redemption of our interest in an investment fund. Other income in 2011 also included a $153 million gain on the sale of our H.D. Vest Financial Services business.

Noninterest Expense        Table 8: Noninterest Expense    
    Noninterest expense was $49.4 billion in 2011, down 2% from $50.5 billion in 2010, driven by lower merger integration
costs, which also contributed to decreases in equipment expense ($2.3 billion, down from $2.6 billion in 2010), lower contract services expense ($1.4 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 2010) and lower foreclosed asset expense ($1.4 billion, down
from $1.5 billion in 2010). The increase in 2010 over 2009 was predominantly due to merger integration costs, Wells Fargo Financial restructuring costs and a $400 million charitable donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation.   
  Personnel-related expenses were up 2% in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to higher revenues generated by businesses with
revenue-based compensation, including the retail securities brokerage and mortgage businesses, and severance expense related to our expense initiative.      Outside professional services included increased investments by our businesses in 2011 in their service delivery systems and approximately $100 million of higher costs associated with the mortgage
servicing regulatory consent orders.      Merger integration costs totaled $1.7 billion in 2011 and $1.9 billion in 2010.
The integration of Wachovia remained on track, and with the successful North Carolina conversion in October 2011, all retail banking store conversions are complete. Remaining integration activities are expected to be concluded by first quarter 2012.
     We continue to target $11 billion of noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2012. However, we currently expect first
quarter 2012 expenses to remain elevated driven by seasonally higher personnel expenses and our final quarter of Wachovia integration expenses, partially offset by continued gains from efficiency and cost save initiatives.

Income Tax Expense       The 2011 annual effective tax rate was 31.9% compared with 33.9% in 2010 and 30.3% in 2009. The lower effective tax rate for 2011 reflected tax benefits from the realization for tax purposes of a
previously written down investment, a decrease in tax expense associated with leveraged leases, as well as tax benefits related to charitable donations of appreciated securities.

Earnings Performance    (continued)       

Operating Segment Results       We are organized for management reporting purposes into three operating segments: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement. These segments are defined by product type and
customer segment and their results are based on our management accounting process, for which there is no comprehensive, authoritative financial accounting guidance equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In fourth quarter
2010, we aligned certain lending businesses into Wholesale Banking from Community Banking to

reflect our previously announced restructuring of Wells Fargo Financial. In first quarter 2011, we realigned a private equity business into Wholesale Banking from Community Banking. Prior periods
have been revised to reflect these changes. Table 9 and the following discussion present our results by operating segment. For a more complete description of our operating segments, including additional financial information and the underlying
management accounting process, see Note 24 (Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this Report.   

Table 9: Operating Segment Results
  Highlights    

Community Banking  offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for
consumers and small businesses including investment, insurance and trust services in 39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 states and D.C. through its Regional Banking and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage business units.
     Community Banking reported net income of $9.1 billion and revenue of $50.7 billion in 2011. Revenue decreased $3.8 billion,
or 7%, from 2010 due to reduced mortgage banking income, lower yields on investment securities and expected reductions in the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios, partially offset by long-term debt run-off and lower deposit costs. Net
interest income decreased $2.3 billion, or 7%, from 2010, mostly due to lower average loans (down $32.0 billion from 2010) as a result of planned run-off in the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios (including home equity and Pick-A-Pay),
loan repricing at lower rates, and lower yields on our investment securities. This decline in interest income was mitigated by long-term debt run-off and continued low funding costs. Average core deposits increased $19.8 billion, or 4%, from 2010,
as growth in liquid deposits more than offset maturities of higher yielding certificates of deposit. The number of consumer checking accounts grew 3.2% from December 31, 2010. Noninterest income decreased $1.5 billion, or 7%, from 2010, mainly
due to lower volume-related mortgage banking income and lower deposit service charges as a result of the third quarter 2010 implementation of Regulation E, partially offset by lower other than temporary impairments. Noninterest expense decreased
$837 million, or 3%, from 2010, due to reduced expenses across most categories, as well as a 2010 charitable donation expense of $400 million. The provision for credit losses decreased $5.8 billion from 2010 as credit quality in most of our consumer
and business loan portfolios continued to improve. Charge-offs decreased $4.8 billion from 2010, reflecting improvement primarily in the home equity, credit card, and small business lending portfolios. Additionally, we released $2.4 billion of

allowance for credit losses in 2011, compared with $1.4 billion released in 2010.   
   Wholesale Banking  provides financial solutions across the U.S. and globally to middle market and large corporate customers with annual revenue
generally in excess of $20 million. Products and businesses include commercial banking, investment banking and capital markets, securities investment, government and institutional banking, corporate banking, commercial real estate,
treasury management, capital finance, international, insurance, real estate capital markets, commercial mortgage servicing, corporate trust, equipment finance, asset backed finance, and asset management.   
  Wholesale Banking reported net income of $7.0 billion in 2011, up $1.1 billion, or 19%, from $5.9 billion in 2010. Average loans of
$249.1 billion increased $18.6 billion, or 8%, driven by strong demand from both our domestic and international customers. Average core deposits of $202.1 billion in 2011 increased $32.1 billion, or 19%, from 2010 reflecting continued strong
customer liquidity.      The year over year increase in net income was the result of a decrease in the provision for credit
losses and noninterest expenses, which more than offset a decrease in revenue. Revenue decreased $759 million, or 3%, from 2010, as broad-based growth among many businesses, including strong loan and deposit growth, was offset by lower PCI
resolutions revenue, lower sales and trading revenue, and lower crop insurance revenue.      Total noninterest expense in 2011
decreased $75 million compared with 2010 as lower operating losses and foreclosed asset expenses were partially offset by higher personnel expense. The provision for credit losses declined $2.0 billion from 2010, and reflected a $1.6 billion
improvement in net credit losses along with a $950 million allowance release (compared with a $561 million release in 2010).

40   

Wholesale Banking s 2011 financial results benefited from loan portfolio
acquisitions and strong borrowing demand across all customers segments, with most lending areas experiencing double-digit rates of growth in loans outstandings, including in Asset Backed Finance, Capital Finance, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real
Estate, Government and Institutional Banking, International, and Real Estate Capital Markets.       Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement 
provides a full range of financial advisory services to clients using a planning approach to meet each client s needs. Wealth Management provides affluent and high net worth clients with a complete range of wealth management solutions,
including financial planning, private banking, credit, investment management and trust. Family Wealth (which will be rebranded as Abbot Downing, a Wells Fargo Business, in April 2012) meets the unique needs of ultra high net worth customers.
Brokerage serves customers  advisory, brokerage and financial needs as part of one of the largest full-service brokerage firms in the United States. Retirement is a national leader in providing institutional retirement and trust services
(including 401(k) and pension plan record keeping) for businesses, retail retirement solutions for

individuals, and reinsurance services for the life insurance industry.   
  Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement reported net income of $1.3 billion in 2011, up $283 million, or 28%, from 2010. Revenue increased $458
million, or 4%, from 2010, as net interest income increased $148 million, or 5%, and noninterest income increased $310 million, or 3%, from 2010. Net interest income increased due to higher investment income and the impact of deposit balance growth.
Average core deposits of $130.4 billion in 2011 increased 8% from 2010. Noninterest income increased as higher asset-based fees and a gain on the sale of the H.D. Vest Financial Services business exceeded losses on deferred compensation plan
investments (offset in expense) and lower brokerage transaction revenue. Noninterest expense increased $167 million, or 2%, from 2010, primarily due to growth in personnel cost largely due to higher broker commissions driven by increased
production levels, as well as increases in other incentive compensation, offset by lower deferred compensation. The provision for credit losses decreased $164 million, or 49%, from 2010, due to lower net charge-offs.

Balance
Sheet Analysis            

During 2011, our total assets grew 4%, funded by core deposit growth of 9% and internal capital generation,
partially offset by a reduction in our long-term borrowings. Our total loans and core deposits at December 31, 2011, were up from the previous year. At December 31, 2011, core deposits totaled 113% of the loan portfolio, and we have the
capacity to add higher yielding earning assets to generate future revenue and earnings growth. The strength of our business model produced record earnings and high rates of internal capital generation as reflected in our improved capital ratios.
Tier 1 capital increased to 11.33% as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 common equity to 9.46% at December 31, 2011, up from 11.16% and

8.30%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Total capital was 14.76% and Tier 1 leverage was 9.03%, compared with 15.01% and 9.19%, respectively, at December 2010. For additional information
about our capital requirements, see Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.      The following discussion provides additional information about the major components of our balance sheet. Information about changes in our asset mix and about our capital is included in the  Earnings
Performance   Net Interest Income  and  Capital Management  sections of this Report.   

Securities Available for Sale
       Table 10: Securities Available for Sale   Summary    

Table 10 presents a summary of our securities
available-for-sale portfolio. Securities available for sale consist of both debt and marketable equity securities. We hold debt securities available for sale primarily for liquidity, interest rate risk management and long-term yield enhancement.
Accordingly, this portfolio consists primarily of liquid,

high-quality federal agency debt and privately issued mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The total net unrealized gains on securities available for sale were $7.0 billion at December 31,
2011, down from net unrealized gains of $8.3 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily due to gains realized from sales partially offset by slight widening of credit spreads in some asset classes.

41   

Balance Sheet Analysis    (continued)       

We analyze securities for OTTI quarterly, or more often if a potential loss-triggering
event occurs. Of the $711 million OTTI write-downs recognized in 2011, $423 million related to debt securities. There were $118 million in OTTI write-downs for marketable equity securities and $170 million in OTTI write-downs related to
nonmarketable equity securities. For a discussion of our OTTI accounting policies and underlying considerations and analysis see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Securities) and Note 5 (Securities Available for Sale) to
Financial Statements in this Report.      At December 31, 2011, debt securities available for sale included $32.6 billion of
municipal bonds, of which 78% were rated  A-  or better, based on external and, in some cases, internal ratings. Additionally, some of these bonds are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. These guaranteed bonds are predominantly
investment grade and were generally underwritten in accordance with our own investment standards prior to the determination to purchase, without relying on the bond insurer s guarantee in making the investment decision. Our municipal bond
holdings continue to be monitored as part of our ongoing impairment analysis of our securities available for sale.      The
weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities available for sale was 4.9 years at December 31, 2011. Because 61% of this portfolio is MBS, the expected remaining maturity may differ from contractual maturity because borrowers
generally have the right to prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature. The estimated effect of a 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on the fair value and the expected remaining maturity of the MBS available for
sale are shown in Table 11.       Table 11: Mortgage-Backed Securities    
    See Note 5 (Securities Available for Sale) to Financial Statements in this Report for securities
available for sale by security type.   

42   

Loan Portfolio       Total loans were $769.6 billion at December 31, 2011, up $12.4 billion from December 31, 2010. Table 12 provides a summarized breakdown by loan portfolio. Increased balances in many
commercial loan portfolios more than offset the continued reduction in the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios, which have declined $21.0 billion since December 31, 2010, as well as the soft demand in consumer loans in response
to economic conditions. Additional information on the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios is included in Table 17 in the  Credit Risk Management  section of this Report.

Many loan portfolios had double-digit year-over-year loan growth in average balances,
including government and institutional banking, asset-backed finance, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real estate, international and real estate capital markets. Included in the growth of loans from year end 2010 were loan purchases
in 2011 with a period end balance of $3.6 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate. Consumer loans include the consolidation of $5.6 billion of reverse mortgage loans previously sold.

A discussion of average loan balances and a comparative detail of average loan balances
is included in Table 5 under  Earnings Performance   Net Interest Income  earlier in this Report. Year-end balances and other loan related information are in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in
this Report.   
 
   Table 13 shows contractual loan maturities for selected loan categories and sensitivities
of those loans to changes in interest rates.

Balance Sheet Analysis    (continued)       

Deposits       Deposits totaled $920.1 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $847.9 billion at December 31, 2010. Table 14 provides additional detail regarding deposits. Comparative detail of
average deposit balances is provided in Table 5 under

Earnings Performance   Net Interest Income  earlier in this Report. Total core deposits were $872.6 billion at December 31, 2011, up $74.4 billion from
$798.2 billion at December 31, 2010. We continued to gain new deposit customers and deepen our relationships with existing customers in 2011.

Table 14: Deposits    

(1)  
  Reflects Eurodollar sweep balances included in core deposits.           Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements        

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that are not recorded in the
balance sheet, or may be recorded in the balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our
credit, market or liquidity risks, (3) diversify our funding sources, and/or (4) optimize capital.       Off-Balance Sheet
Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities       We routinely enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special
purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Historically, the majority of SPEs were formed in connection with securitization transactions. For more information on
securitizations, including sales proceeds and cash flows from securitizations, see Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Guarantees and Certain Contingent Arrangements    
  Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset,
liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities lending and other indemnifications, liquidity agreements, written put options, recourse obligations, residual value guarantees and contingent
consideration.      For more information on guarantees and certain contingent arrangements, see Note 14 (Guarantees) to Financial
Statements in this Report.   

44   

Contractual Obligations       In addition to the contractual commitments and arrangements previously described, which, depending on the nature of the obligation, may or may not require use of our resources, we enter into other
contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including debt issuances for the funding of operations and leases for premises and equipment.

Table 15 summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, excluding
obligations for short-term borrowing arrangements and pension and postretirement benefit plans. More information on those obligations is in Note 12 (Short-Term Borrowings) and Note 20 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) to Financial
Statements in this Report.   

Table 15: Contractual Obligations

(1)  
  Includes interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking, and market rate and other savings accounts.     

(2)  
  Includes obligations under capital leases of $116 million.     

(3)  
  Includes agreements to purchase goods or services and an annual minimum property tax obligation.     

We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities, and
those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have various unrecognized tax obligations related to these operations that may require future cash tax payments to various taxing authorities. Because of their uncertain nature, the expected
timing and amounts of these payments generally are not reasonably estimable or determinable. We estimate the amount payable in the next 12 months based on the status of our tax examinations and settlement discussions. See Note 21 (Income Taxes) to
Financial Statements in this Report for more information.      We enter into derivatives, which create contractual obligations,
as part of our interest rate risk management process for our customers or for other trading activities. See the  Risk Management   Asset/Liability  section and Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for more
information.       Transactions with Related Parties       The Related Party Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) requires disclosure of material related-party transactions, other
than compensation arrangements, expense allowances and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. We had no material related-party transactions required to be reported for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Risk Management    

All financial institutions must manage and control a variety of business risks that can significantly
affect their financial performance. Key among those are credit, asset/liability and market risk. The discussion that follows provides information on how we manage these risks.       Credit Risk Management        Table 16: Total Loans Outstanding by Portfolio Segment and
Class of Financing Receivable    

(1)  
  Substantially all of our foreign loan portfolio is commercial. Loans are classified as foreign if the borrower s primary address is outside of the United States.

We employ various credit risk management and monitoring activities to mitigate risks
associated with multiple risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate including:   

Loan concentrations and related credit quality      

Counterparty credit risk      

Economic and market conditions      

Legislative or regulatory mandates      

Changes in interest rates      

Merger and acquisition activities      

Reputation risk         Our credit risk management process is governed centrally, but provides for decentralized management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit
policies, disciplined credit underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit process. The Credit Committee of our Board of Directors (Board) receives
reports from management, including our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and its responsibilities include oversight of the administration and effectiveness of, and compliance with, our credit policies and the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses.      A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well controlled underwriting process, which we believe
is appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

46   

Non-Strategic and Liquidating Loan Portfolios   We continually evaluate and modify our credit
policies to address appropriate levels of risk. We may designate certain portfolios and loan products as non-strategic or liquidating to cease their continued origination as we actively work to limit losses and reduce our exposures.   
  Table 17 identifies our non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios. They consist primarily of the Pick-a-Pay mortgage portfolio and
other PCI loans acquired from Wachovia as well as some portfolios from legacy Wells Fargo Home Equity and

Wells Fargo Financial. Effective first quarter 2011, we added our education finance government guaranteed loan portfolio to the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios as there is no longer
a U.S. Government guaranteed student loan program available to private financial institutions pursuant to legislation in 2010. The outstanding balances on non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios have decreased 41% since the merger with
Wachovia at December 31, 2008, and decreased 16% from the end of 2010.   

Table 17: Non-Strategic and
Liquidating Loan Portfolios

  Net of purchase accounting adjustments related to PCI loans.     

(2)  
  Effective first quarter 2011, we included our education finance government guaranteed loan portfolio as there is no longer a U.S. Government guaranteed student loan program
available to private financial institutions, pursuant to legislation in 2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.     

The Wells Fargo Financial debt consolidation portfolio included $1.1 billion of loans at
December 31, 2011, that were considered prime based on secondary market standards, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010. The rest is non-prime but was originated with underwriting standards to reduce credit risk. Wells Fargo
Financial ceased originating loans and leases through its indirect auto business channel by the end of 2008.      The home equity
liquidating portfolio was designated in fourth quarter 2007 from loans generated through third party channels. This portfolio is discussed in more detail in the  Credit Risk Management   Home Equity Portfolios  section of this Report.
     Information about the liquidating PCI and Pick-a-Pay loan portfolios is provided in the discussion of loan portfolios that
follows.   

47   

Risk Management   Credit Risk Management    (continued)       

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS  Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since
their origination and where it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are accounted for using the measurement provisions for PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of
acquisition, and the historical allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over. Such loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield and not based on consideration given to contractual
interest payments. Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired in the Wachovia acquisition on December 31, 2008.      A
nonaccretable difference is established for PCI loans to absorb losses expected on those loans at the date of acquisition. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect the income statement or the allowance for credit losses.
     Substantially all commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely,
Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.
     Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure
of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual PCI loan from a pool based on comparing the amount

received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the amount received
from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective yield for the remaining loans in the pool are addressed by our quarterly cash flow
evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of
the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting, if there
has been a concession granted in excess of the original nonaccretable difference. We include these TDRs in our impaired loans.   
  During 2011, we recognized in income $239 million released from the nonaccretable difference related to commercial PCI loans due to
payoffs and other resolutions. We also transferred $373 million from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield for PCI loans with improving credit-related cash flows and absorbed $2.3 billion of losses in the nonaccretable difference from
loan resolutions and write-downs. Table 18 provides an analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference.   

Table 18: Changes in Nonaccretable
Difference for PCI Loans    

(1)  
  Release of the nonaccretable difference for settlement with borrower, on individually accounted PCI loans, increases interest income in the period of settlement. Pick-a-Pay and
Other consumer PCI loans do not reflect nonaccretable difference releases for settlements with borrowers due to pool accounting for those loans, which assumes that the amount received approximates the pool performance expectations.

(2)  
  Release of the nonaccretable difference as a result of sales to third parties increases noninterest income in the period of the sale.     

(3)  
  Reclassification of nonaccretable difference to accretable yield for loans with increased cash flow estimates will result in increased interest income as a prospective yield
adjustment over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans.     

(4)  
  Write-downs to net realizable value of PCI loans are absorbed by the nonaccretable difference when severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower
financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.     
         48   

Since December 31, 2008, we have released $5.9 billion in nonaccretable difference,
including $4.2 billion transferred from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield and $1.7 billion released to income through loan resolutions. We have provided $1.8 billion in the allowance for credit losses for certain PCI loans or
pools of PCI loans that have had credit-related decreases to cash flows expected to be collected. The net result is a $4.2 billion reduction from December 31, 2008, through December 31, 2011, in our initial projected losses on all PCI
loans.   
 
   At December 31, 2011, the allowance for credit losses on certain PCI loans was $231
million. The allowance is necessary to absorb credit-related decreases since acquisition in cash flows expected to be collected and primarily relates to individual PCI loans. Table 19 analyzes the actual and projected loss results on PCI loans since
acquisition through December 31, 2011.      For additional information on PCI loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies   Loans) and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Table 19: Actual and Projected
Loss Results on PCI Loans    

(1)  
  Release of the nonaccretable difference for settlement with borrower, on individually accounted PCI loans, increases interest income in the period of settlement. Pick-a-Pay and
Other consumer PCI loans do not reflect nonaccretable difference releases for settlements with borrowers due to pool accounting for those loans, which assumes that the amount received approximates the pool performance expectations.

Significant Portfolio Reviews   Measuring and monitoring our credit risk is an ongoing process
that tracks delinquencies, collateral values, FICO scores, economic trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is
designed to enable early identification of developing risk and to support our determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following analysis reviews the relevant concentrations and certain credit metrics of our significant
portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis and credit metric information.       COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  The CRE portfolio, consisting of both CRE mortgage loans and CRE construction loans, totaled $125.4 billion, or 16% of total loans, at December 31, 2011. CRE
construction loans totaled $19.4 billion at December 31, 2011, and CRE mortgage loans totaled $106.0 billion, of which 33% was to owner-occupants. Table 20 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type with the related nonaccrual totals. CRE
nonaccrual loans totaled 5% of the non-PCI CRE outstanding balance at December 31, 2011, a decline of 24% from December 31, 2010. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations
of combined CRE loans are in California and Florida, which represented 25% and 9% of the total CRE portfolio, respectively. By property type, the largest concentrations are office buildings at 26% and industrial/warehouse at 11% of the portfolio. We
subject commercial loans to individual risk assessment using our

internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to pass and criticized categories with our criticized categories aligned to special mention, substandard and doubtful
categories as defined by bank regulatory agencies. At December 31, 2011, we had $22.5 billion of criticized non-PCI CRE mortgage loans, a decrease of 13% from December 31, 2010, and $6.8 billion of criticized non-PCI construction
loans, a decrease of 39% from December 31, 2010. Total criticized non-PCI CRE loans remained relatively high as a result of the continued challenging conditions in the real estate market. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to
Financial Statements in this Report for further detail on criticized loans.      The underwriting of CRE loans primarily focuses
on cash flows inherent in the creditworthiness of the customer, in addition to collateral valuations. To identify and manage newly emerging problem CRE loans, we employ a high level of monitoring and regular customer interaction to understand and
manage the risks associated with these loans, including regular loan reviews and appraisal updates. Management is engaged to identify issues and dedicated workout groups are in place to manage problem loans. At December 31, 2011, the recorded
investment in PCI CRE loans totaled $5.0 billion, down from $12.3 billion at December 31, 2008, reflecting the reduction resulting from principal payments, loan resolutions and write-downs.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE   FINANCING  For purposes of portfolio risk
management, we aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to market segmentation and standard industry codes. Table 21 summarizes commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry with
the related nonaccrual totals. Across our non-PCI commercial loans and leases, the commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio generally experienced better credit improvement than our CRE portfolios in 2011. Of the total commercial
and industrial loans and lease financing non-PCI portfolio, 0.09% was 90 days or more past due and still accruing, 1.22% was nonaccruing and 12.5% was criticized. In comparison, of the total non-PCI CRE portfolio, 0.29% was 90 days or more past due
and still accruing, 4.97% was nonaccruing and 24.3% was criticized. Also, the net charge-off rate for both portfolios declined in 2011 from 2010. We believe the commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio is well underwritten and
is diverse in its risk with relatively level concentrations across several industries. Our credit risk management process for this portfolio primarily focuses on a customer s ability to repay the loan through their cash flow.   
  A majority of our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term liquid assets, such as accounts
receivable, inventory and securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a secondary source of repayment. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis and credit metric information.

Risk Management   Credit Risk Management    (continued)       

During the current credit cycle, we have experienced an increase in loans requiring risk
mitigation activities including the restructuring of loan terms and requests for extensions of commercial and industrial and CRE loans. All actions are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and our assessment of the borrower s ability to
perform under the agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or additional collateral or guarantees.
In cases where the value of collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside repayment guarantee in providing the extension.   
  Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly related to the guarantor s creditworthiness, capacity and willingness
to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the most current financial information available and is focused on various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and
current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor s reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us based on our analysis as well as other lenders  experience with the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor s
credit strength is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance methodology for commercial and industrial and CRE loans.   
  In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate the collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated support of
any repayment guarantor. In many cases the strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the performance of the
guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual status and we charge-off all or a portion of the loan based on the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, if any.      At the time of restructuring, we evaluate whether the loan should be classified as a TDR, and account for it accordingly. For more information on TDRs, see  Troubled Debt Restructurings  later
in this section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

FOREIGN LOANS AND EUROPEAN EXPOSURE  Our foreign country risk monitoring process incorporates
frequent dialogue with our foreign financial institution customers, counterparties and regulatory agencies, enhanced by centralized monitoring of macroeconomic and capital markets conditions. We establish exposure limits for each country via a
centralized oversight process based on the needs of our customers, and in consideration of relevant economic, political, social, legal, and transfer risks. We monitor exposures closely and adjust our limits in response to changing conditions.
We conduct periodic stress tests of our significant country risk exposures, analyzing the potential direct and indirect impacts of various macroeconomic and capital market scenarios.   
  At December 31, 2011, foreign loans represented approximately 5% of our total consolidated loans outstanding and approximately 3%
of our total assets. Our largest foreign country exposure on an ultimate risk basis was the United Kingdom, which amounted to approximately $11.0 billion, or 0.84%, of our consolidated assets, and included $1.7 billion of sovereign claims. Our
United Kingdom sovereign claims arise primarily from deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support of our London branch.      Several European countries have been experiencing significant fiscal and economic deterioration in recent months. In January 2012, Standard   Poor s Ratings Service (S P) downgraded the
long-term sovereign debt ratings of France, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal, Austria, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia, as well as the rating of the European Financial Stability Facility. In addition, in February 2012, Moody s Investors Service
lowered the sovereign debt ratings of Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain, and Fitch Ratings and S P downgraded Greece to the lowest rating above a default. At December 31, 2011, our exposure to these downgraded countries,
including cross-border claims on an ultimate risk basis, and foreign exchange and derivative products, aggregated approximately $3.4 billion, including $182.3 million of sovereign claims.   
  Based on our most recent stress testing activities conducted in fourth quarter 2011, in the event of a rapid deterioration in financial
and economic conditions in Europe we believe it is unlikely we would experience a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources as a result of our European exposures due to the relatively small
magnitude of our exposures as well as its diversity by country, type, and counterparty.      Table 22 provides information
regarding our exposures to European sovereign entities and institutions located within such countries, including cross-border claims on an ultimate risk basis, and foreign exchange and derivative products.

52   

Table 22: European Exposure    

(1)  
  Lending exposure includes funded loans and unfunded commitments, leveraged leases, and money market placements presented on a gross basis prior to the deduction of impairment
allowance and collateral received under the terms of the credit agreements.     

(2)  
  Includes $1.6 billion in PCI loans, predominantly to customers in Germany and United Kingdom territories, and $3.1 billion in defeased leases secured predominantly by U.S.
Treasury and government agency securities, or government guaranteed.     

(3)  
  Represents issuer exposure on cross-border debt and equity securities, held in trading or available-for-sale portfolio, at fair value.     

(4)  
  Represents counterparty exposure on foreign exchange and derivative contracts, and securities resale and lending agreements. This exposure is presented net of counterparty
netting adjustments and reduced by the amount of cash collateral. It includes credit default swaps (CDS) predominantly used to manage our U.S. and London-based cash credit trading businesses, which sometimes results in selling and purchasing
protection on the identical reference entity. Generally, we do not use market instruments such as CDS to hedge the credit risk of our investment or loan positions, although we do use them to manage risk in our trading businesses. At
December 31, 2011, the gross notional amount of our CDS sold on reference assets domiciled in Europe was substantially offset by the notional of CDS purchased from investment-grade counterparties. Additionally, at December 31, 2011, we did
not have any net exposure on sovereign CDS associated with European countries.     

(5)  
  Total non-sovereign exposure is comprised of $12.3 billion exposure to financial institutions and $14.3 billion to non-financial corporations at December 31, 2011.

(6)  
  Includes non-sovereign exposure to Greece and Portugal in the amount of $9.5 million and $ 49.1 million, respectively. We had no sovereign debt exposure to these countries
at December 31, 2011.     

REAL ESTATE 1-4 FAMILY MORTGAGE LOANS  Our real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans primarily include
loans we have made to customers and retained as part of our asset liability management strategy. These loans also include the Pick-a-Pay portfolio acquired from Wachovia and the home equity portfolio, which are discussed later in this Report. In
addition, these loans include other purchased loans and loans included on our balance sheet due to the adoption of consolidation accounting guidance related to VIEs.      Our underwriting and periodic review of loans collateralized by residential real property includes appraisals or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are
computer-based tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of large numbers of properties in a short period of time using market comparables and price trends for local
market areas. The primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of an individual property may vary significantly from the average for the market area. We have processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk management
guidelines addressing the circumstances when AVMs may be used. AVMs are generally used in underwriting to support property values on loan originations only where the loan amount is under $250,000. We generally require property visitation appraisals
by a qualified independent appraiser for larger residential property loans.      Some of our real estate 1-4 family first and
junior lien mortgage loans include an interest-only feature as part of the loan terms. These interest-only loans were approximately 21% of total loans at December 31, 2011, and 25% at December 31, 2010. Substantially all of these
interest-only loans at origination were considered to be prime or near prime.      We believe we have manageable adjustable-rate
mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our owned mortgage loan portfolios. We

do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing
mortgage loans. Our liquidating option ARM portfolio was acquired from Wachovia.      We continue to modify real estate 1-4
family mortgage loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers in the current difficult economic cycle. Loans are underwritten at the time of the modification in accordance with underwriting guidelines established for governmental and proprietary
loan modification programs. As a participant in the U.S. Treasury s Making Home Affordable (MHA) programs, we are focused on helping customers stay in their homes. The MHA programs create a standardization of modification terms including
incentives paid to borrowers, servicers, and investors. MHA includes the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) for first lien loans and the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP) for junior lien loans. Under both our proprietary programs
and the MHA programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness. These programs generally include trial payment periods of three to four months, and after
successful completion and compliance with terms during this period, the loan is permanently modified. During both the trial payment period and/or permanent modification period, the loan is accounted for as a TDR loan. See Table 32 for discussion on
trial modifications, including balances. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for discussion on how we determine the allowance attributable to our modified residential real estate portfolios.

Risk Management   Credit Risk Management    (continued)       

The concentrations of real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans by
state are presented in Table 23. Our real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to borrowers in California represented approximately 13% of total loans (3% of this amount were PCI loans from Wachovia) at December 31, 2011, mostly within the
larger metropolitan areas, with no single California metropolitan area consisting of more than 3% of total loans. We continuously monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our
real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process.      Part of our credit monitoring
includes tracking delinquency, FICO scores and collateral values (LTV/CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio. These metrics experienced improvement throughout 2011, on the non-PCI mortgage portfolio, with the majority of
the improvement occurring in the first half of 2011. Loans 30 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2011, totaled $18.4 billion, or 6%, of total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $20.3 billion, or 7%, at December 31, 2010. Loans with FICO
scores lower than 640 totaled $44.1 billion at December 31, 2011, or 15% of all non-PCI mortgages, compared with $50.7 billion, or 17%, at December 31, 2010. Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled $74.2 billion at
December 31, 2011, or 26% of total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $84.9 billion, or 29%, at December 31, 2010. Information regarding credit risk trends can be found in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial
Statements in this Report.       Table 23: Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans by State

reverse mortgages.     
 
    PICK-A-PAY PORTFOLIO  The Pick-a-Pay portfolio was one of the consumer residential first mortgage
portfolios we acquired from Wachovia and a majority of the portfolio was identified as PCI loans. The Pick-a-Pay portfolio is a liquidating portfolio, as Wachovia ceased originating new Pick-a-Pay loans in 2008.   
  The Pick-a-Pay portfolio includes loans that offer payment options (Pick-a-Pay option payment loans), and also includes loans that were
originated without the option payment feature, loans that no longer offer the option feature as a result of our modification efforts since the acquisition, and loans where the customer voluntarily converted to a fixed-rate product. The Pick-a-Pay
portfolio is included in the consumer real estate 1-4 family first mortgage class of loans throughout this Report. Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgages and lines of credit associated with Pick-a-Pay loans are reported in the home equity
portfolio. Table 24 provides balances over time related to the types of loans included in the portfolio since acquisition.

54   

Table 24: Pick-a-Pay Portfolio - Comparison to Acquisition Date    

(1)  
  Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist
that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.     

PCI loans in the Pick-a-Pay portfolio had an adjusted unpaid principal balance of
$36.9 billion and a carrying value of $29.1 billion at December 31, 2011. The carrying value of the PCI loans is net of remaining purchase accounting write-downs, which reflected their fair value at acquisition. At acquisition, we recorded
a $22.4 billion write-down in purchase accounting on Pick-a-Pay loans that were impaired.      Pick-a-Pay option payment
loans may be adjustable or fixed rate. They are home mortgages on which the customer has the option each month to select from among four payment options: (1) a minimum payment as described below, (2) an interest-only payment, (3) a
fully amortizing 15-year payment, or (4) a fully amortizing 30-year payment.      The minimum monthly payment for
substantially all of our Pick-a-Pay loans is reset annually. The new minimum monthly payment amount usually cannot increase by more than 7.5% of the then-existing principal and interest payment amount. The minimum payment may not be sufficient to
pay the monthly interest due and in those situations a loan on which the customer has made a minimum payment is subject to  negative amortization,  where unpaid interest is added to the principal balance of the loan. The amount of interest
that has been added to a loan balance is referred to as  deferred interest.  Total deferred interest of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2011, was down from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010, due to loan modification efforts as
well as interest rates remaining low, resulting in the minimum payment option covering the interest and some principal on many loans. Approximately 83% of the Pick-a-Pay customers making a minimum payment in December 2011 did not defer interest,
compared with 75% in December 2010.      Deferral of interest on a Pick-a-Pay loan may continue as long as the loan balance
remains below a pre-defined principal cap, which is based on the percentage that the current loan balance represents to the original loan balance. Loans with an original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio equal to or below 85% have a cap of 125% of the
original loan balance, and these loans represent substantially all the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. Loans with an original LTV ratio above 85% have a cap of 110% of the original loan balance. Most of the Pick-a-Pay loans on which there is a deferred
interest balance re-amortize (the monthly payment amount is reset or  recast ) on the earlier of the date

when the loan balance reaches its principal cap, or the 10-year anniversary of the loan. For a small population of Pick-a-Pay loans, the recast occurs at the five-year anniversary. After a
recast, the customers  new payment terms are reset to the amount necessary to repay the balance over the rest of the original loan term.      Due to the terms of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, there is little recast risk in the near term. Based on assumptions of a flat rate environment, if all eligible customers elect the minimum payment option 100%
of the time and no balances prepay, we would expect the following balances of loans to recast based on reaching the principal cap: $7 million in 2012, $22 million in 2013 and $81 million in 2014. In 2011, $3 million was recast based
on reaching the principal cap. In addition, in a flat rate environment, we would expect the following balances of loans to start fully amortizing due to reaching their recast anniversary date and also having a payment change at the recast date
greater than the annual 7.5% reset: $47 million in 2012, $100 million in 2013 and $373 million in 2014. In 2011, the amount of loans reaching their recast anniversary date and also having a payment change over the annual 7.5% reset was $7
million.      Table 25 reflects the geographic distribution of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio broken out between PCI loans and all
other loans. In stressed housing markets with declining home prices and increasing delinquencies, the LTV ratio is a useful metric in predicting future real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loan performance, including potential charge-offs. Because
PCI loans were initially recorded at fair value, including write-downs for expected credit losses, the ratio of the carrying value to the current collateral value will be lower compared with the LTV ratio based on the adjusted unpaid principal
balance. For informational purposes, we have included both ratios for PCI loans in the following table.

  The individual states shown in this table represent the top five states based on the total net carrying value of the Pick-a-Pay loans at the beginning of 2011.

(2)  
  Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist
that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.     

(3)  
  The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values are generally determined using automated valuation
models (AVM) and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas.

(4)  
  Carrying value, which does not reflect the allowance for loan losses, includes remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which, for PCI loans may include the nonaccretable
difference and the accretable yield and, for all other loans, an adjustment to mark the loans to a market yield at date of merger less any subsequent charge-offs.     

(5)  
  The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value.     

To maximize return and allow flexibility for customers to avoid foreclosure, we have in
place several loss mitigation strategies for our Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio. We contact customers who are experiencing financial difficulty and may in certain cases modify the terms of a loan based on a customer s documented income and other
circumstances.      We also have taken steps to work with customers to refinance or restructure their Pick-a-Pay loans into other
loan products. For customers at risk, we offer combinations of term extensions of up to 40 years (from 30 years), interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and, in geographies with substantial property value declines, we may offer
permanent principal forgiveness.      In 2011, we completed more than 19,000 proprietary and HAMP Pick-a-Pay loan modifications
and have completed more than 99,000 modifications since the Wachovia acquisition, resulting in $4.0 billion of principal forgiveness to our Pick-a-Pay customers as well as an additional $516 million of conditional forgiveness that can be earned by
borrowers through performance over the next three years. As announced in October 2010, we entered into agreements with certain state attorneys general whereby we agreed to offer loan modifications to eligible Pick-a-Pay customers through June 2013.
These agreements cover the majority of our option payment loan portfolio and require that we offer modifications (both HAMP and proprietary) to eligible customers with the option payment loan product. In response to these agreements, we developed an
enhanced proprietary modification product

that allows for various means of principal forgiveness along with changes to other loan terms. Given that these agreements cover all modification efforts to eligible customers for the applicable
states, our modifications (both HAMP and proprietary) for our Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio performed in 2011 were primarily consistent with these agreements.      Due to better than expected performance observed on the Pick-a-Pay portfolio compared with the original acquisition estimates, we have reclassified $2.4 billion from the nonaccretable difference to the
accretable yield since acquisition. This performance is primarily attributable to significant modification efforts as well as the portfolio s delinquency stabilization. The resulting increase in the accretable yield will be realized over the
remaining life of the portfolio, which is estimated to have a weighted-average life of approximately 11 years at December 31, 2011. The accretable yield percentage at the end of 2011 was 4.45%, down from 4.54% at the end of 2010. Fluctuations
in the accretable yield are driven by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans, prepayment assumptions, and expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life of the portfolio, which will be affected by the pace and
degree of improvements in the U.S. economy and housing markets and projected lifetime performance resulting from loan modification activity. Changes in the projected timing of cash flow events, including loan liquidations, modifications and short
sales, can also affect the accretable yield percentage and the estimated weighted-average life of the portfolio.   

56   

HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIOS  Our home equity portfolios consist of real estate 1-4 family junior lien
mortgages and first and junior lines of credit secured by real estate. Our first lien lines of credit represent 20% of our home equity portfolio and are included in real estate 1-4 family first mortgages. The majority of our junior lien loan
products are amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between 5 to 30 years. Junior lien loans with balloon payments at the end of the repayment term represent a small portion of our junior lien loans.   
  Our first and junior lien lines of credit products generally have a draw period of 10 years with variable interest rates and payment
options during the draw period of (1) interest only or (2) 1.5% of total outstanding balance. During the draw period, the borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with
terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing
payment loan with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. The draw periods for a majority of our lines of credit end after 2015.

We continuously monitor the credit performance of our junior lien mortgage portfolio for
trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of loss. We have observed that the severity of loss for junior lien mortgages is high and generally not affected by whether we or a third party own or service the related first mortgage,
but that the frequency of loss is lower when we own or service the first mortgage. In general, we have limited information available on the delinquency status of the third party owned or serviced senior lien where we also have a junior lien. To
capture this inherent loss content, we use the experience of our junior lien mortgages behind delinquent first liens that are owned or serviced by us adjusted for observed higher delinquency rates associated with junior lien mortgages behind third
party first mortgages. We incorporate this inherent loss content into our allowance for loan losses. During 2011 we refined our allowance process for junior liens to ensure appropriate consideration of the relative difference in loss experience
for junior liens behind first lien mortgage loans we own or service, compared with those behind first lien mortgage loans owned or serviced by third parties. In addition, we refined our allowance process for junior liens that are current, but are in
their revolving period, to more appropriately reflect the inherent loss where the borrower is delinquent on the corresponding first lien mortgage loans. The impact of these revisions was not significant to our allowance. Table 26 summarizes
delinquency and loss rates by the holder of the lien.

We also monitor the number of borrowers paying the minimum amount due on a monthly basis.
In December 2011, approximately 94% of our borrowers with home equity outstanding balances paid at least the minimum amount due, which included 46% of our borrowers paying only the minimum amount due.   
  The home equity liquidating portfolio includes home equity loans generated through third party channels, including correspondent loans.
This liquidating portfolio represents less than 1% of our total loans outstanding at December 31, 2011, and contains some of the highest risk in our home equity portfolio, with a loss rate of 9.36% compared with 3.02% for the core
(non-liquidating) home equity portfolio. Table 27 shows the credit attributes of the core and liquidating home equity portfolios and

lists the top five states by outstanding balance. California loans represent the largest state concentration in each of these portfolios. The decrease in outstanding balances primarily reflects
loan paydowns and charge-offs. As of December 31, 2011, 36% of the outstanding balance of the core home equity portfolio was associated with loans that had a combined loan to value (CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%. CLTV means the ratio of
the total loan balance of first mortgages and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit line products) to property collateral value. The unsecured portion of the outstanding balances of these loans (the outstanding amount
that was in excess of the most recent property collateral value) totaled 17% of the core home equity portfolio at December 31, 2011.

  Consists predominantly of real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgages and first and junior lines of credit secured by real estate, but excludes PCI loans because their losses
are generally covered by PCI accounting adjustment at the date of acquisition, and excludes real estate 1-4 family first lien open-ended line reverse mortgages because they do not have scheduled payments. These reverse mortgage loans are insured by

CREDIT CARDS  Our credit card portfolio totaled $22.8 billion at December 31, 2011, which
represented 3% of our total outstanding loans. Net charge-offs were 5.58% of average loans for 2011, down from 9.74% in 2010.       OTHER
REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT  Other revolving credit and installment loans totaled $86.5 billion at December 31, 2011, and predominantly include automobile, student and security-based margin loans. The loss rate for other revolving
credit and installment loans was 1.22% of average loans for 2011 compared with 1.94% for 2010. Excluding government guaranteed student loans, the loss rates were 1.46% and 2.43% of average loans for 2011 and 2010, respectively.

NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED ASSETS (NPA s) Table 28 shows the five-year trend for NPAs and Table
29 summarizes NPAs for each of the four quarters of 2011. We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when:   

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the borrower s financial condition
and the adequacy of collateral, if any);      

they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest

or principal, unless both well-secured and in the process of collection; or      

part of the principal balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred.      
  Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Loans) to Financial Statements in this Report describes our accounting policy
for nonaccrual and impaired loans.

Total NPAs were $26.0 billion (3.37% of total loans) at December 31, 2011, and
included $21.3 billion of nonaccrual loans and $4.7 billion of foreclosed assets. Nonaccrual loans

declined throughout 2011. Table 30 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual loans.

Table 30: Analysis of Changes in
Nonaccrual Loans

  Other outflows include the effects of VIE deconsolidations and adjustments for loans carried at fair value.     

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period represent inflows for loans
that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans that are charged off, sold, transferred to foreclosed properties, or are no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the
borrower s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities.      While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, we
believe the estimated loss exposure remaining in these balances is significantly mitigated by four factors. First, 99% of consumer nonaccrual loans and 96% of commercial nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the $13.1 billion of consumer nonaccrual loans
at December 31, 2011, 99% are secured by real estate and 36% have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or below. Second, losses have already been recognized on 51% of the remaining balance of consumer nonaccruals and commercial nonaccruals have
been written down by $2.1 billion. Generally, when a consumer real estate loan is 120 days past due, we transfer it to nonaccrual status. When the loan reaches 180 days past due it is our policy to write these loans down to net realizable value
(fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell), except for modifications in their trial period that are not written down as long as trial payments are made on time. Thereafter, we revalue each loan regularly and recognize additional
write-downs if needed. Third, as of December 31, 2011, 58% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest. Fourth, the risk of loss for all nonaccruals has been

considered and we believe is appropriately covered by the allowance for loan losses.      Under both our proprietary modification programs and the MHA programs, customers may be required to provide updated documentation, and some programs require completion of trial payment periods to
demonstrate sustained performance, before the loan can be removed from nonaccrual status. In addition, for loans in foreclosure, many states, including California, Florida and New Jersey, have enacted legislation that significantly increases the
time frames to complete the foreclosure process, meaning that loans will remain in nonaccrual status for longer periods.      If
interest due on all nonaccrual loans (including loans that were, but are no longer on nonaccrual at year end) had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $1.1 billion of interest would have been recorded as income on these loans,
compared with $344 million actually recorded as interest income in 2011 versus $1.3 billion and $362 million, respectively, in 2010.      Table 31 provides a summary of foreclosed assets and an analysis of the changes.

  Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate securing government insured/guaranteed loans is classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest
for government insured/guaranteed loans secured by the foreclosed real estate are collectible because the loans are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA.     

(2)  
  Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. The net change in
government insured/guaranteed foreclosed assets is made up of inflows from MHFI and MHFS, and outflows when we are reimbursed by FHA/VA.     

NPAs at December 31, 2011, included $1.3 billion of foreclosed real estate that is
FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to have little to no loss content, and $3.3 billion of foreclosed assets, which have been written down to estimated net realizable value. Foreclosed assets decreased $1.3 billion, or 22%, in 2011 from
December 31, 2010. Of this decrease, $730 million were foreclosed loans from the PCI portfolio. At December 31, 2011, 74% of our foreclosed assets of $4.7 billion have been in the foreclosed assets portfolio one year or less. Given
our real estate-secured loan concentrations and current economic conditions, we anticipate we will continue to hold a high level of NPAs on our balance sheet.

We process foreclosures on a regular basis for the loans we service for others as well as
those we hold in our loan portfolio. We use foreclosure, however, only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. We employ extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to find other solutions for our
borrowers. We maintain appropriate staffing in our workout and collection teams to ensure troubled borrowers receive appropriate attention and assistance.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)        Table 32: Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) (1)    

(2)  
  Based on clarifying guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received in December 2011, we classify trial modifications as TDRs at the beginning of the trial
period. For many of our consumer real estate modification programs, we may require a borrower to make trial payments generally for a period of three to four months. Prior to the SEC clarification, we classified trial modifications as TDRs once a
borrower successfully completed the trial period in accordance with the terms.     

Table 32 provides information regarding the recorded investment of loans modified in
TDRs. It reflects the retrospective adoption from the beginning of 2011 of ASU 2011-2, which provided additional guidance for classifying modifications as TDRs. This new guidance specifically clarifies, among other things, the definition of a
concession, including how to evaluate modified loan terms against terms that would be commensurate for loans with similar credit risk. For our commercial loan modifications, we do not typically modify principal through forgiveness or
forbearance or reduce the contractual interest rate. In fact, in many cases, we obtain higher rates of interest, additional collateral or guarantor support, or other improvements to the terms. Certain commercial loan modifications are now
classified as TDRs under the clarified guidance. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $5.2 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in
this Report for more information.      We do not forgive principal for a majority of our TDRs, but in those situations where
principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off to the extent not done so prior to the modification. We sometimes delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance)
and charge off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not considered fully collectible.

Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan types when a restructuring is
involved. We underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower s documented income, debt to income ratios, and other factors. Loans lacking
sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time of modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been modified, if the borrower has demonstrated performance under the
previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a
sustained period of performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual, and a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the
loan balance, if we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the modified agreement will not be collectible.

  Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held-for-sale.     

(2)  
  Net change in trial modifications is made up of inflows of new TDRs entering trial payment period, and outflows of modifications that successfully perform and enter into a
permanent modification or do not perform according to the terms of the trial period plan, and as a result are charged-off or moved to foreclosure. Our recent experience is that most of the mortgages that enter a trial payment period program are
successful in completing the program requirements.     
         64   

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or
principal are still accruing if they are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later
delinquency, usually 120 days past due. PCI loans of $8.7 billion, $11.6 billion and $16.1 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are excluded from this disclosure even though they are 90 days or more contractually past due.
These PCI loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield and not based on consideration given to contractual interest payments.      Excluding insured/guaranteed loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2011, were down $601 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2010. The decline was due to loss
mitigation activities including modifications and

increased collection capacity/process improvements, charge-offs, lower early stage delinquency levels and credit stabilization. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose repayments
are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were
$20.5 billion at December 31, 2011, up from $15.8 billion at December 31, 2010, due primarily to growth in the FHA/VA portfolio over the past two years and the subsequent seasoning of those loans.   
  Table 34 reflects non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing by class for loans not government insured/guaranteed. For

         66   

Table 35 presents net charge-offs for the four quarters and full year of 2011 and 2010.
Net charge-offs in 2011 were $11.3 billion (1.49% of average total loans outstanding) compared with $17.8 billion (2.30%) in 2010. Total net charge-offs decreased in 2011 due in part to modestly improving economic conditions,
aggressive loss mitigation activities aimed at working with our customers through their financial challenges, and a runoff of the pool of the most challenged vintages/relationships in the portfolio. Total net charge-offs decreased in each of the
first three quarters of the year and were essentially flat in fourth quarter 2011.      Net charge-offs in the 1-4 family first
mortgage portfolio totaled $3.5 billion in 2011, compared with $4.4 billion a year ago.      Net charge-offs in the real estate
1-4 family junior lien portfolio decreased $1.2 billion to $3.5 billion in 2011. More information about the home equity portfolio, which includes substantially all of our real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans, is available in Table
27 in this Report and the related discussion.      Credit card charge-offs decreased $980 million to $1.2 billion in 2011.
Delinquency levels stabilized and loss levels continued to improve in 2011 as the economy showed signs of stabilization.   
  Commercial net charge-offs were $2.0 billion in 2011 compared with $4.8 billion in 2010, as market liquidity and improving market
conditions helped stabilize performance results.   
 
    ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES   The allowance for credit losses, which consists of the
allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date, excluding loans carried at fair
value. The detail of the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.   
  We employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for credit losses each quarter. This process takes into
consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-specific loss factors. The process involves subjective as well as complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of
credit metrics and trends. These trends, however, do not solely determine the appropriate allowance amount as we use several analytical tools. For additional information on our allowance for credit losses, see the  Critical Accounting Policies
  Allowance for Credit Losses  section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.      We believe the allowance for credit losses of $19.7 billion at December 31, 2011, was appropriate to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, at
December 31, 2011. The allowance for credit losses is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the
sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in the business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. In addition to the allowance for credit losses there was
$10.7 billion and $13.4 billion of nonaccretable difference at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to absorb losses for PCI loans.      As a result of PCI accounting, the book value of high risk loans was written down at the time of acquisition. Therefore, the allowance for credit losses is lower than otherwise would have been required
without PCI loan accounting and certain ratios of the Company may not be directly comparable with periods prior to the merger or with credit-related ratios of other financial institutions. For additional information on PCI loans, see the  Risk
Management   Credit Risk Management   Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans  section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.   
  The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to
such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and marketability of collateral. Over half of nonaccrual loans were home mortgages, auto and other consumer loans at December 31, 2011.

67   

Risk Management   Credit Risk Management    (continued)       

The $3.7 billion decline in the allowance for loan losses in 2011 reflected the release
of allowance due to lower levels of inherent credit loss in the portfolio compared with prior year-end levels. Total provision for credit losses was $7.9 billion in 2011, $15.8 billion in 2010 and $21.7 billion in 2009. The 2011
provision was $3.4 billion less than net charge-offs. Primary drivers of the 2011 provision reduction were decreased net charge-offs and continued improvement in the credit quality of the commercial and consumer portfolios and related loss estimates
as seen in declining delinquency and nonperforming loan levels. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future allowance releases in 2012, although at more modest levels.   
  In 2010, the provision of $15.8 billion was $2.0 billion less than net charge-offs. The reduction in the provision was primarily due to
continued improvement in the consumer portfolios and related loss estimates and improvement in economic conditions. These drivers were partially offset by an increase in impaired loans and related allowance primarily associated with increased
consumer loan modification efforts and a $693 million addition to the allowance due to adoption of consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010.      In 2009, the provision of $21.7 billion was $3.5 billion greater than net charge-offs. Primary drivers of the 2009 provision were deterioration in economic conditions that increased the projected
losses in our commercial portfolios, additional allowance associated with loan modification programs designed to keep qualifying borrowers in their homes, and the establishment of additional allowance for PCI loans.   
  In determining the appropriate allowance attributable to our residential real estate portfolios, the loss rates used in our analysis
include the impact of our established loan modification programs. When modifications occur or are probable to occur, our allowance considers the impact of these modifications, taking into consideration the associated credit cost, including
re-defaults of modified loans and projected loss severity. The loss content associated with existing and probable loan modifications has been considered in our allowance reserving methodology.   
  Changes in the allowance reflect changes in statistically derived loss estimates, historical loss experience, current trends in borrower
risk and/or general economic activity on portfolio performance, and management s estimate for imprecision and uncertainty, including ongoing discussions with regulatory and government agencies regarding mortgage foreclosure-related matters.
     Table 36 presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses by loan segments and classes for the last five years.

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES   We sell residential mortgage loans to
various parties, including (1) government-sponsored entities Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (GSEs) who include the mortgage loans in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial
institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans that back securities guaranteed by GNMA. We may be required to repurchase these mortgage
loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively  repurchase ) in the event of a breach of contractual
representations or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach.      We have established a mortgage repurchase liability related to various representations and warranties that reflect management s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a repurchase obligation,
whether or not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Our mortgage repurchase liability estimation process also incorporates a forecast for repurchase demands associated with mortgage insurance rescission activity.
Currently, repurchase demands primarily relate to 2006 through 2008 vintages and to GSE-guaranteed MBS.

During 2011, we continued to experience elevated levels of repurchase activity measured
by the number of investor repurchase demands and our level of repurchases. We repurchased or reimbursed investors for incurred losses on mortgage loans with original balances of $2.8 billion in 2011, compared with $2.6 billion in 2010. Additionally,
we negotiated settlements on pools of mortgage loans with original sold balances of $341 million in 2011, compared with $675 million in 2010, to eliminate the risk of repurchase on these loans. We incurred net losses on repurchased loans, investor
reimbursements and loan pool global settlements totaling $1.2 billion in 2011, compared with $1.4 billion in 2010.      Table 37
provides the number of unresolved repurchase demands and mortgage insurance rescissions. We do not typically receive repurchase requests from GNMA, FHA/HUD or VA. As an originator of an FHA insured or VA guaranteed loan, we are responsible for
obtaining the insurance with FHA or the guarantee with the VA. To the extent we are not able to obtain the insurance or the guarantee we must request to repurchase the loan from the GNMA pool. Such repurchases from GNMA pools typically represent a
self-initiated process upon discovery of the uninsurable loan (usually within 180 days from funding of the loan). Alternatively, in lieu of repurchasing loans from GNMA pools, we may be asked by the FHA/HUD or the VA to indemnify them (as
applicable) for defects found in the Post Endorsement Technical Review process or audits performed by FHA/HUD or the VA. Our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses incorporates probable losses associated with such indemnification.

Table 37: Unresolved Repurchase
Demands and Mortgage Insurance Rescissions    

(2)  
  As part of our representations and warranties in our loan sales contracts, we typically represent to GSEs and private investors that certain loans have mortgage insurance to the
extent there are loans that have loan to value ratios in excess of 80% that require mortgage insurance. To the extent the mortgage insurance is rescinded by the mortgage insurer due to a claim of breach of a contractual representation or warranty,
the lack of insurance may result in a repurchase demand from an investor. Similar to repurchase demands, we evaluate mortgage insurance rescission notices for validity and appeal for reinstatement if the rescission was not based on a contractual
breach. When investor demands are received due to lack of mortgage insurance, they are reported as unresolved repurchase demands based on the applicable investor category for the loan (GSE or private). Over the last year, approximately 20% of our
repurchase demands from GSEs had mortgage insurance rescission as one of the reasons for the repurchase demand. Of all the mortgage insurance rescissions notices received in 2010, approximately 70% have resulted in repurchase demands through
December 2011. Not all mortgage insurance rescissions received in 2010 have been completed through the appeals process with the mortgage insurer and upon successful appeal, we work with the investor to rescind the repurchase demand.

(3)  
  While the original loan balances related to these demands are presented above, the establishment of the repurchase liability is based on a combination of factors, such as our
appeals success rates, reimbursement by correspondent and other third-party originators, and projected loss severity, which is driven by the difference between the current loan balance and the estimated collateral value less costs to sell the
property.     
         70   

The level of repurchase demands outstanding at December 31, 2011, was down from a
year ago in both number of outstanding loans and in total dollar balances as we continued to work through the demands. Customary with industry practice, we have the right of recourse against correspondent lenders from whom we have purchased loans
with respect to representations and warranties. Of total repurchase demands and mortgage insurance recissions outstanding as of December 31, 2011, presented in Table 37, approximately 20% relate to loans purchased from correspondent lenders.
Due primarily to the financial difficulties of some correspondent lenders, we typically recover on average approximately 50% of losses from these lenders. Historical recovery rates as well as projected lender performance are incorporated in the
establishment of our mortgage repurchase liability.      Our liability for repurchases, included in  Accrued expenses and
other liabilities  in our consolidated financial statements, was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. In 2011 $1.3 billion of additions to the liability were recorded, which reduced net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales
activities, compared with $1.6 billion in 2010. Our additions to the repurchase liability in 2011 and 2010 predominately reflect updated assumptions about probable future demands on prior vintages. This increase in our estimate for probable future
demands in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in repurchase demands from the GSEs on the 2006-2008 vintages with a higher than anticipated increase from the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) in the latter half of 2011.

We believe we have a high quality residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio. Of the
$1.8 trillion in the residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio at December 31, 2011, 92% was current, less than 2% was subprime at origination, and less than 1% was home equity securitizations. Our combined delinquency and foreclosure rate
on this portfolio was 7.96% at December 31, 2011, compared with 8.02% at December 31, 2010. In this portfolio 5% are private label securitizations where we originated the loan and therefore have some repurchase risk. We believe the risk of
repurchase in our private label securitizations is substantially reduced, relative to other private label securitizations, because approximately half of this portfolio of private label securitizations that include our mortgage loans do not contain
representations and warranties regarding borrower or other third party misrepresentations related to the mortgage loan, general compliance with underwriting guidelines, or property valuation, which are commonly asserted bases for repurchase. For
this 5% private label securitization segment of our residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio, 58% are loans from 2005 vintages or earlier (weighted average age of 75 months); 79% were prime at origination; and approximately 66% are jumbo loans.
The weighted-average LTV as of December 31, 2011, for this private securitization segment was 78%. We believe the highest risk segment of these private label securitizations is the subprime loans originated in 2006 and 2007. These subprime
loans have seller representations and warranties and currently have LTVs close to or exceeding 100%, and represent 9% of the 5% private label securitization portion of the residential mortgage servicing portfolio. We had only $110 million of
repurchases related to private label securitizations in 2011. Of the servicing portfolio, 4% is non-agency acquired servicing and 2% is private whole loan sales. We did not underwrite and securitize the non-agency acquired servicing and therefore we
have no obligation on that portion of our servicing portfolio to the investor for any repurchase demands arising from origination practices. For the private whole loan segment, while we do have repurchase risk on these prior loan sales, less than 2%
were subprime at origination and loans that were sold and subsequently securitized are included in the private label securitization segment discussed above.      Table 38 summarizes the changes in our mortgage repurchase liability.

  Results from such factors as credit deterioration, changes in investor demand and mortgage insurer practices, and changes in the financial stability of correspondent lenders.

The mortgage repurchase liability of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2011, represents
our best estimate of the probable loss that we may incur for various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage loans. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors,
investor demand strategies and other external conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgment. We
maintain regular contact with the GSEs and other significant investors to monitor and address their repurchase demand practices and concerns. Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is
a range of losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability that are reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss for representations and warranties does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently
available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. The high end of this range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our recorded liability was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, and was
determined based upon modifying the assumptions utilized in our best estimate of probable loss to reflect what we believe to be the high end of reasonably possible adverse assumptions. For additional information on our repurchase liability, see the
 Critical Accounting Policies   Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses  section and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.   
  The repurchase liability is predominantly applicable to loans we originated and sold with representations and warranties. Most of these
loans are included in our servicing portfolio. Our repurchase liability estimate involves consideration of many factors that influence the key assumptions of what our repurchase volume may be and what loss on average we may incur. Those key
assumptions and the sensitivity of the liability to immediate adverse changes in them at December 31, 2011, are presented in Table 39. For additional information about the range of loss that is reasonably possible in excess of the recorded
mortgage repurchase liability, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Table 39: Mortgage Repurchase Liability   Sensitivity / Assumptions    

(1)  
  Represents total estimated average loss rate on repurchased loans, net of recovery from third party originators, based on historical experience and current economic conditions.
The average loss rate includes the impact of repurchased loans for which no loss is expected to be realized.     
  To the extent that economic conditions and the housing market do not improve or future investor repurchase demands and appeals success
rates differ from past experience, we could continue to have increased demands and increased loss severity on repurchases, causing future additions to the repurchase liability. However, some of the underwriting standards that were permitted by the
GSEs for conforming loans in the 2006 through 2008 vintages, which significantly contributed to recent levels of repurchase demands, were tightened starting in mid to late 2008. Accordingly, we do not expect a similar rate of repurchase requests
from the 2009 and prospective vintages, absent deterioration in economic conditions or changes in investor behavior.      In
October 2011, the Arizona Department of Insurance assumed full and exclusive power of management and control of PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. (PMI) and announced that PMI will pay 50% of claim amounts in cash, with the rest deferred. In November 2011,
PMI s parent company, PMI Group Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Wells Fargo has previously utilized PMI to provide mortgage insurance on certain loans originated and held in our portfolio. Additionally, PMI has provided mortgage
insurance on loans originated and sold to third-party investors. For loans sold to third-party investors, there is no additional risk of repurchase loss to Wells Fargo associated with the deferred insurance claim amounts from PMI since this credit

72   

risk is owned by the investor in the loan. We also hold a small amount of residential mortgage-backed securities, which are backed by mortgages with a limited amount of insurance provided by PMI.
Because the loans and securities held in our portfolios with PMI insurance support are limited in amount, we do not anticipate the deferred claim payments will result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.   
   RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of residential
mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, FHA/VA/GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. The following
discussion summarizes the primary duties and requirements of servicing and related recent industry developments.       General Servicing Duties
and Requirements       The loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are
typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage
loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization,
consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and (6) for loans sold into private label securitizations, manage the foreclosed property through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are typically
to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage loans by the servicer, (2) consult with each servicer and use reasonable efforts to cause the servicer to observe its servicing obligations, (3) prepare monthly
distribution statements to security holders and, if required by the securitization documents, certain periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC, (4) if required by the securitization documents, calculate distributions and loss
allocations on the mortgage-backed securities, (5) prepare tax and information returns of the securitization trust, and (6) advance amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their advancing obligations.   
  Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions we take in
such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities we incur when acting in compliance with the specified standard. For example, most private label securitization agreements under which we act as servicer or master servicer
typically provide that the servicer and the master servicer are entitled to indemnification by the securitization trust for taking action or refraining from taking action in good faith or for errors in judgment. However, we are not indemnified, but
rather are required to indemnify the securitization trustee, against any failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations or against any of our acts or omissions that involve wilful misfeasance, bad

faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, our duties. In addition, if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be
subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice, which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders. Whole loan sale contracts under which we act as
servicer generally include similar provisions with respect to our actions as servicer. The standards governing servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and
remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an
affected mortgage loan.       Foreclosure and Securitization Matters       During fourth quarter 2010, we identified practices where the final steps relating to the execution of foreclosure affidavits, as well as some aspects of the notarization process were not adhered to. Any
re-execution or redelivery of any documents in connection with foreclosures will involve costs that may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. Further, if the validity of any
foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower, whether successfully or not, we may incur significant litigation costs, which may not be reimbursable to us to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In addition, if a court were to
overturn a foreclosure due to errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower if the required process was not followed and such failure resulted in damages to the borrower. We could also have liability to a
title insurer that insured the title to the property sold in foreclosure. Any such liabilities may not be reimbursable to us to the extent they relate to a securitized mortgage loan.   
  When we securitize mortgage loans we have an obligation to deliver mortgage notes, assignments and other critical documents. Although we
continue to believe that we delivered all documents in accordance with the requirements of each securitization involving our mortgage loans, if any required document with respect to a securitized mortgage loan sold by us is missing or materially
defective, we would be obligated to cure the defect or to repurchase the loan.      To facilitate securitizations it is a common
industry practice to record mortgages in the name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS). Attorneys general of most states have alleged that this common industry practice creates issues regarding whether a securitization trust has
good title to the mortgage loan. MERS is a company that acts as mortgagee of record and as nominee for the owner of the related mortgage note. When mortgages are assigned, such as between an originator and a securitization trust, the change is
recorded electronically on a register maintained by MERS. The purpose of MERS is to save borrowers and lenders from having to record assignments of mortgages in county land offices each time ownership of the mortgage note is assigned. Although MERS
has been in existence and used for many years, it has recently been   

73   

Risk Management   Credit Risk Management    (continued)       

alleged by attorneys general that having a mortgagee of record that is different from the owner of the mortgage note  breaks the chain of title  and clouds the ownership of the loan. We
do not believe that to be the case, and believe that the operative legal principle is that the ownership of a mortgage follows the ownership of the mortgage note, and that a securitization trust should have good title to a mortgage loan if the note
is endorsed and delivered to it, regardless of whether MERS is the mortgagee of record or whether an assignment of mortgage is recorded to the trust. However, in order to foreclose on the mortgage loan, it may be necessary for an assignment of the
mortgage to be completed by MERS to the trust, in order to comply with state law requirements governing foreclosure. Our practice is to obtain assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to commencing the foreclosure process.   
   Consent Orders and Settlement in Principle       In April 2011, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued Consent Orders that require us to correct deficiencies in our
residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure practices that were identified by federal banking regulators in their fourth quarter 2010 review. The Consent Orders also require that we improve our servicing and foreclosure practices. We have
already implemented many of the operational changes that will result from the expanded servicing responsibilities outlined in the Consent Orders.      On February 9, 2012, the OCC and FRB announced the imposition of civil money penalties of $83 million and $85 million, respectively, pursuant to the Consent Orders. These penalties will be satisfied
through payments made under a separate simultaneous federal/state settlement in principle, announced on the same day, among the Department of Justice, Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of the Treasury, the Department
of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Executive Office of the U.S. Trustee, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a task force of Attorneys General representing 49 states, Wells Fargo, and four other servicers related to
investigations of mortgage industry servicing and foreclosure practices. While Oklahoma is not participating in the larger settlement, it is settling separately with the five servicers with a simplified agreement. Under the settlement in principle,
the terms of which do not become final until approval of the settlement agreement by the U.S. District Court and execution of a consent order, which will be in effect for three and one-half years (subject to a trailing review period), we have agreed
to the following programmatic commitments, consisting of three components totalling $5.3 billion:       

Consumer Relief Program  For qualified borrowers with financial hardship and a loan owned and serviced by Wells Fargo, a commitment to provide
$3.4 billion in aggregate consumer relief and assistance programs, including expanded first and second mortgage modifications that

broaden the use of principal reduction to help customers achieve affordability, an expanded short sale program that includes waivers of deficiency balances, forgiveness of arrearages for
unemployed borrowers, cash-for-keys payments to borrowers who voluntarily vacate properties, and  anti-blight  provisions designed to reduce the impact on communities of vacant properties. As of December 31, 2011, the expected impact of
the Consumer Relief Program was covered in our allowance for credit losses and in the nonaccretable difference relating to our purchased credit-impaired residential mortgage portfolio.      

Refinance Program  For qualified borrowers with little or negative equity in their home and a loan owned and serviced by Wells Fargo, an expanded
first-lien refinance program commitment estimated to provide $900 million of aggregate payment relief over the life of the refinanced loans. The Refinance Program will not result in any current-period charge as its impact will be recognized over a
period of years in the form of lower interest income as qualified borrowers benefit from reduced interest rates on loans refinanced under the program.      

Foreclosure Assistance Payment  $1 billion paid directly to the federal government and the participating states for their use to address the
impact of foreclosure challenges as they see fit and which may include direct payments to consumers. As of December 31, 2011, we had fully accrued for the Foreclosure Assistance Payment.      
  California (under a separate California Agreement) and Florida (under a separate Florida Agreement) will receive state-specific
sub-commitments totaling $1.95 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, regarding the amount of Consumer Relief and Refinance Program benefits for these two states as a part of, and not in addition to, the overall commitment to all states for these
two programs.      The amount of credit we will receive toward fulfilling our commitments under the Consumer Relief and Refinance
Programs will be determined based upon the nature of the modification or other relief to the borrower, the characteristics of the loan and the timing of the modification or relief. The terms of the Consumer Relief and Refinance Programs as well as
other servicing matters are discussed in more detail below.       Consumer Relief Program    
  The Consumer Relief Program allows for selection from a menu of various alternatives to meet the $3.4 billion overall commitment, subject to servicer
agreements, agreements with the U.S. Treasury, investor guidelines, mortgage or bond insurer requirements, or other applicable requirements, and is intended to provide assistance to eligible borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty.
Eligible borrowers include borrowers who have a pre-modification LTV in excess of 100%. The settlement provides for various modification and assistance programs with varying levels of credits, minimums, and maximums that can be used to satisfy the
overall commitment amount for different activities, primarily including:   

first lien principal forgiveness for LTV less than or equal to 175%: 100% credit (must constitute at least 30% of the Consumer Relief Program
credits);      

74   

first lien principal forgiveness for LTV greater than 175%: 50% credit for portion forgiven over 175% LTV;      

forgiveness of forbearance amounts on existing loan modifications   40% credit;      

second lien principal forgiveness: 90% credit for loans 90 days or less delinquent; 50% credit for loans greater than 90 but less than 180 days
delinquent; 10% credit for loans 180 days more delinquent. Subject to a number of requirements, servicers participating in the settlement will be obligated to implement second lien principal forgiveness on second mortgages it owns when another
participating servicer reduces principal on a first mortgage via its proprietary non-HAMP modification programs (must constitute at least 60% of the Consumer Relief Program credits when combined with the first lien principal forgiveness credits);

deficiency balance waivers on first and second lien loans: 10% credit;      

short sale deficiency balance waivers on first and second lien loans: 20% to 100% credit depending on whether the servicer, servicer/lien holder or
investor incurs the loss;      

payment arrearages forgiveness for unemployed borrowers: 100% credit;      

transitional funds paid to homeowners in connection with a short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for payments in excess of $1,500: 45% credit if a
non-GSE investor bears the cost or 100% if the servicer bears the cost;      

anti-blight   forgiveness of principal associated with properties where foreclosure is not pursued: 50% credit;      

anti-blight   cash costs paid by servicer for property demolition   100% credit; and      

anti-blight   donation of real estate owned properties to qualifying recipients such as non-profit organizations: 100% credit.
        Additionally, the Consumer Relief Program limits the total amount of credits that may be applied toward
the $3.4 billion commitment from certain activities such as:   

credits from deficiency balance waivers are limited to 10% of credits under the Consumer Relief Program;      

credits for forgiveness of forbearance are limited to 12.5% of credits under the Consumer Relief Program; and      

anti-blight provisions are limited to 12% of credits under the Consumer Relief Program.      
  We will begin to receive credit towards satisfaction of the requirements of the Consumer Relief Program for any activities taken on or
after March 1, 2012. We can also receive an additional 25% credit for any first or second lien principal reduction taken within one year from March 1, 2012. Because we will not receive dollar-for-dollar credit for the relief provided in some
circumstances, the actual relief we provide to borrowers will likely exceed our commitment. The terms also require that we satisfy 75% of the commitments under the Consumer Relief Program within two years from March 1, 2012. If we do not meet this
two-year requirement and also do not meet the entire commitment within three years, we are

required to pay an amount equal to 140% of the unmet commitment amount. If we meet the two-year commitment target, but do not meet the entire commitment amount within the three years, we are
required to pay an amount equal to 125% of the unmet commitment amount. We expect that we will be able to meet our commitment (and state-level sub-commitments) on the Consumer Relief Program within the required timeframes.   
  We expect to be able to meet our Consumer Relief Program commitment primarily through our first and second lien modification and short
sale and other deficiency balance waiver programs. We have evaluated our commitment along with the menu of credits and believe that fulfilling our commitment under the Consumer Relief Program has been appropriately considered in our estimation for
the allowance for loan losses as well as our cash flow projections to evaluate the nonaccretable difference for our PCI portfolios at December 31, 2011.       Refinance Program       The Refinance Program is intended for borrowers in good standing who are
not experiencing financial difficulty, but are not able to take advantage of refinancing at lower rates to lower their payments because they have little or negative equity in their home. The terms of the pending settlement for the Refinance Program
require that we provide notification to eligible borrowers indicating that they may refinance under the program. The minimum eligibility criteria for the program are as follows:   

must be Wells Fargo owned first lien mortgage loan on property that is occupied;      

loan must be current with no delinquencies in the last 12 months;      

must be fixed rate, adjustable rate, or interest-only mortgages with an initial period of five years or more;      

loans must have a current interest rate of at least 5.25% or 100 basis points above the Freddie Mac current primary mortgage market survey rate,
whichever is greater;      

the minimum difference between the current interest rate and the offered interest rate under the Refinance Program must be at least 25 basis points or
there must be at least a $100 reduction in monthly payment; and      

the maximum unpaid principal balance must be below the GSE lending limit applicable to the respective state where the property is located.
        Additionally, there are defined exclusions from the eligibility criteria such as FHA/VA loans, properties
outside the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and loans for borrowers who have been in bankruptcy or foreclosure anytime in the prior 24 months. We are also permitted to extend the Refinance Program to borrowers beyond the minimum
eligible population detailed above provided they have an LTV over 80% and would not have qualified for a refinance under our other offered refinance programs in existence as of September 30, 2011. The structure of the refinanced loans can vary to
include interest rate reductions for the entire life of the loan or,   

75   

Risk Management   Credit Risk Management    (continued)       

depending on current interest rates, a minimum of 5 years. Additionally, the original term of the loan can be changed and the rate reduction can be executed via a modification of the existing
loan terms or a refinance into a new loan. The new loan or modified loan must be a fully amortizing product and the new interest rate will be capped at 100 basis points over the Freddie Mac current primary mortgage market survey rate or 5.25%,
whichever is greater, during the initial rate reduction period.      The credit we receive for each refinanced loan towards
satisfying the $900 million financial commitment for the Refinance Program is calculated as the difference between the pre-existing interest rate and the new interest rate multiplied by the unpaid principal balance multiplied by a defined
multiplier. The defined multiplier is 5 if the rate reduction only applies for 5 years or if the remaining term is less than 10 years, 6 if the remaining term is between 10 and 15 years, and 8 if the remaining term is greater than 15 years. In
addition, the terms of the settlement allow for additional dollars spent on the Refinance Program to be credited towards satisfying the requirements of the Consumer Relief Program (25% for the first lien principal reduction obligations and 75% for
the second lien principal reduction obligations) subject to certain caps. We will receive credit under the Refinance Program for activities taken on or after March 1, 2012. The Refinance Program allows for an additional 25% credit (additional
credit) for all refinance credits earned in the first 12 months of the program. We expect that we will be able to complete the number of refinances necessary to satisfy the entire credit in the first 12 months of offering the Refinance Program. If
successful in this regard, the estimated lifetime amount of interest income reduction to the portfolio will be approximately $720 million and the additional credit earned will be $180 million.   
  We expect that we will refinance approximately 20,000 borrowers with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $4.0 billion in order
to meet the commitment amount under the Refinance Program. Based on the mix of loans we anticipate will be refinanced, we estimate their weighted average note rate will be reduced by approximately 260 annual basis points and that their weighted
average estimated remaining life will be approximately 7 years. These estimates will be impacted by the actual number of eligible borrowers that accept a refinance offer, their existing and new note rates and the remaining term of the actual loans
refinanced. The impact of fulfilling our commitment under the Refinance Program will be recognized over a period of years in the form of lower interest income as qualified borrowers benefit from reduced interest rates on loans refinanced under the
Refinance Program. Based on our expectation that we will fulfill the credit needs for the Refinance Program within the first 12 months, we expect the future reduction in interest income to be approximately $100 million annually. As a result of
refinancings under the Refinance Program we will be foregoing interest that we may not otherwise have agreed to forego. No loss was recognized in our financial statements for this estimated foregone interest income as the impact will be recognized
over a period of years in the form of lower interest income as qualified borrowers benefit from reduced interest rates on loans refinanced under the Refinance Program. This impact to foregone interest

income will be increased if we do not meet our expectation for fulfilling the total commitment for the Refinance Program in the first twelve months. The impact of this foregone interest income on
our future net interest margin is anticipated to be modestly adverse and will be influenced by the overall mortgage interest rate environment, which products are accepted by the eligible borrowers, and the pace of the execution of the program. The
Refinance Program will also impact our fair value for these loans. The estimated reduction to the fair value of our loans for the Refinance Program is approximately $700 million and will be impacted by our actual execution of the program and
borrower acceptance rates.      Given that this component of the settlement relates to borrowers in good standing as to their
payment history who are not experiencing financial difficulty, we will evaluate each borrower to confirm their ability to repay their mortgage obligation. This evaluation will include reviewing key credit and underwriting policy metrics to validate
that these borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulty and therefore, actions taken under the Refinance Program would not be considered a troubled debt restructuring. To the extent we determine that an eligible borrower is experiencing
financial difficulty, we will consider alternative modification programs which may result in loans being classified and accounted for as troubled debt restructurings.      We expect that we will be able to meet the obligations of our commitment for the Refinance Program (and any state-level sub-commitments) and will not be required to pay for not meeting our commitment.
      Comprehensive National Servicing Standards       The settlement also establishes comprehensive national servicing standards that will govern loan default and foreclosure activities. These standards reflect a new set of best practices for mortgage
servicing and not the identification of existing flaws or errors in current servicing practices. The national servicing standards include:   

rules governing the preparation of documentation submitted in connection with judicial foreclosures, including foreclosure affidavits, declarations,
and sworn statements;      

rules governing the preparation of evidence submitted to support non-judicial and quasi-judicial foreclosures;      

requirements for ensuring the accuracy of borrower s account information;      

documentation of the foreclosing entity s enforceable interest in the note, holder status, and chain of assignment;      

rules governing bankruptcy documentation and process including proofs of claim and motions for relief from stay;      

rules governing the oversight of third-party providers including foreclosure law firms, foreclosure trustees, subservicers, and other third parties
retained to provide foreclosure, bankruptcy, or mortgage servicing activities;      

requirements for loss mitigation programs, including:      

notification to borrowers of loss mitigation options and enhanced communication of status of loss mitigation review;      

restriction of  dual track  progression of foreclosure during consideration for loan modification;      

establishment of a borrower  single point of contact 

76   

development of electronic loan portals for status of first lien loan modifications; and      

establishment of loan modification decision review process      

enhanced protections for service members;      

restrictions on certain default, foreclosure, and bankruptcy-related service fees; and      

restrictions on the imposition of force-placed insurance          Monitoring and Other Settlement Matters       The settlement will be overseen by a third party
monitor who will receive quarterly reports from servicers capturing progress towards implementing the servicing standards and satisfaction of the commitments of the Consumer Relief Program and the Refinance Program. These reports will be based on an
agreed upon set of metrics and other information relevant to our compliance obligations. The enforcement provisions of the settlement include the parties  right to seek penalties for non-compliance, the monitor s right to seek additional
measurement metrics, and the right to enforce the Consent Order in federal court.      As part of the settlement, servicers will
be released by the participating states and federal agencies from a number of servicing and origination claims. The releases given by the states and the federal agencies generally apply to  covered servicing conduct  and  covered
origination conduct.  The state release and the federal release extend to  covered servicing conduct  prior to the effective date of the settlement. The federal release for  covered origination conduct  depends on which
agency and which law is involved. The Department of Justice and the Treasury are releasing claims under federal consumer credit laws governing loan origination. The FTC is releasing claims relating to origination conduct. HUD s release of
claims relating to origination conduct is limited to claims based exclusively on false annual certifications of compliance that are submitted to HUD, and retains the right to pursue individual loan-level violations of the Federal Housing
Administration origination rules and regulations. The

Department of Justice s release from claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (claims involving harm to financial institutions or federal agencies based
on intentional fraud or misrepresentation by a bank or its affiliates) is also limited.      A number of subject areas are carved
out from the releases: criminal law violations, claims by natural persons, unpaid taxes, fair lending claims (the state release applies this exception only to loan origination conduct, while the federal release extends the exception to origination
and servicing conduct), securitization claims (includes claims that the government could bring as an investor in mortgage-related securities and for the benefit of investors or for conduct directed at investors), claims against MERS or MERSCORP,
Inc., although we are released from claims relating to our use of MERS (but still retain an obligation as a MERS shareholder to indemnify MERS against third-party claims), claims of county recorders, and certain existing litigation and other
obligations. Under the sub-commitment agreement with California, there is a limited expansion of its ability to pursue certain origination claims involving individual claims for actual fraud against consumers for origination conduct occurring on or
after July 1, 2009. There are also side agreements with New York, Delaware and Massachusetts whereby these states retain the right to pursue their existing MERS litigation, subject to certain limitations.   
  Other aspects of the federal release include a carve out under federal consumer credit laws for violations of RESPA related to private
mortgage insurance and the retention of all rights by FHFA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Bank, the SEC, the CFPB (after July 21, 2011) and the federal banking agencies.   
  Additional information on risks and litigation relating to servicing activities is included in Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial
Statements in this Report.   

77   

Asset/Liability Management       Asset/liability management involves the evaluation, monitoring and management of interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. The Corporate Asset/Liability Management Committee (Corporate
ALCO), which oversees these risks and reports periodically to the Finance Committee of the Board, consists of senior financial and business executives. Each of our principal business groups has its own asset/liability management committee and
process linked to the Corporate ALCO process.       INTEREST RATE RISK     Interest rate risk, which potentially can have a
significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk because:   

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times (for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are
generally falling, earnings will initially decline);      

assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts (for example, when the general level of interest rates is falling, we may
reduce rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general decline in market interest rates);      

short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields
and funding costs differently); or      

the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if long-term mortgage interest
rates decline sharply, MBS held in the securities available-for-sale portfolio may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce portfolio income).      
  Interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of
MSRs and other financial instruments, the value of the pension liability and other items affecting earnings.      We assess
interest rate risk by comparing our most likely earnings plan with various earnings simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change over time, the speed of change and the
projected shape of the yield curve. For example, as of December 31, 2011, our most recent simulation indicated estimated earnings at risk of less than 1% of our most likely earnings plan over the next 12 months under a range of both lower and
higher interest rates, including a scenario in which the federal funds rate remains unchanged and the 10-year Constant Maturity Treasury bond yield averages below 2.00%, and a scenario in which the federal funds rate rises to 3.75% and the 10-year
Constant Maturity Treasury bond yield increases to 5.10%. Simulation estimates depend on, and will change with, the size and mix of our actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation. Due to timing differences between the
quarterly valuation of MSRs and the eventual impact of interest rates on mortgage banking volumes, earnings at risk in any particular quarter could be higher than the average earnings at risk over the 12-month simulation period, depending on the
path   

of interest rates and on our hedging strategies for MSRs. See the  Risk Management   Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk  section in this Report for more information.
     We use exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposures. The
notional or contractual amount, credit risk amount and estimated net fair value of these derivatives as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, are presented in Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We use derivatives for
asset/liability management in three main ways:   

to convert a major portion of our long-term fixed-rate debt, which we issue to finance the Company, from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments
by entering into receive-fixed swaps;      

to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments or vice versa;
and      

to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, forwards and
options.          MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK   We originate, fund and service mortgage loans,
which subjects us to various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing some or all of the long-term fixed-rate mortgage
loans we originate and most of the ARMs we originate. On the other hand, we may hold originated ARMs and fixed-rate mortgage loans in our loan portfolio as an investment for our growing base of core deposits. We determine whether the loans will be
held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment. We may subsequently change our intent to hold loans for investment and sell some or all of our ARMs or fixed-rate mortgages as part of our corporate asset/liability management. We may
also acquire and add to our securities available for sale a portion of the securities issued at the time we securitize MHFS.   
  Notwithstanding the continued downturn in the housing sector, and the continued lack of liquidity in the nonconforming secondary
markets, our mortgage banking revenue remained strong, reflecting the complementary origination and servicing strengths of the business. The secondary market for agency-conforming mortgages functioned well during 2011.   
  Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates may potentially reduce total
origination and servicing fees, the value of our residential MSRs measured at fair value, the value of MHFS and the associated income and loss reflected in mortgage banking noninterest income, the income and expense associated with instruments
(economic hedges) used to hedge changes in the fair value of MSRs and MHFS, and the value of derivative loan commitments (interest rate  locks ) extended to mortgage applicants.   
  Interest rates affect the amount and timing of origination and servicing fees because consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of
refinancing activity are sensitive to changes in mortgage interest rates. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees

78   

and may also lead to an increase in servicing fee income, depending on the level of new loans added to the servicing portfolio and prepayments. Given the time it takes for consumer behavior to
fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will affect origination and servicing fees with a lag. The
amount and timing of the impact on origination and servicing fees will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the change in interest rates.      We measure MHFS at fair value for prime MHFS originations for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist to reliably support fair value pricing models used for these loans.
Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, and related direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. We also measure at fair value certain of our other interests held related to residential loan sales and
securitizations. We believe fair value measurement for prime MHFS and other interests held, which we hedge with free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) along with our MSRs measured at fair value, reduces certain timing differences and better
matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. During 2011 and 2010, in response to continued secondary market illiquidity, we continued to originate certain prime
non-agency loans to be held for investment for the foreseeable future rather than to be held for sale. In addition, in 2011 and 2010, we originated certain prime agency-eligible loans to be held for investment as part of our asset/liability
management strategy.      We initially measure all of our MSRs at fair value and carry substantially all of them at fair value
depending on our strategy for managing interest rate risk. Under this method, the MSRs are recorded at fair value at the time we sell or securitize the related mortgage loans. The carrying value of MSRs carried at fair value reflects changes in fair
value at the end of each quarter and changes are included in net servicing income, a component of mortgage banking noninterest income. If the fair value of the MSRs increases, income is recognized; if the fair value of the MSRs decreases, a loss is
recognized. We use a dynamic and sophisticated model to estimate the fair value of our MSRs and periodically benchmark our estimates to independent appraisals. The valuation of MSRs can be highly subjective and involve complex judgments by
management about matters that are inherently unpredictable. See  Critical Accounting Policies   Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights  section of this Report for additional information. Changes in interest rates influence
a variety of significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of MSRs, including prepayment speeds, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements.
     A decline in interest rates generally increases the propensity for refinancing, reduces the expected duration of the
servicing portfolio and therefore reduces the estimated fair value of MSRs. This reduction in fair value causes a charge to income for MSRs carried at fair value, net of any gains on free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge MSRs. We
may choose not to

fully hedge all the potential decline in the value of our MSRs resulting from a decline in interest rates because the potential increase in origination/servicing fees in that scenario provides a
partial  natural business hedge.  An increase in interest rates generally reduces the propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the servicing portfolio and therefore increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs.
However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand and therefore reduce origination income.      The
price risk associated with our MSRs is economically hedged with a combination of highly liquid interest rate forward instruments including mortgage forward contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate options. All of the instruments included in
the hedge are marked to market daily. Because the hedging instruments are traded in highly liquid markets, their prices are readily observable and are fully reflected in each quarter s mark to market. Quarterly MSR hedging results include a
combination of directional gain or loss due to market changes as well as any carry income generated. If the economic hedge is effective, its overall directional hedge gain or loss will offset the change in the valuation of the underlying MSR asset.
Gains or losses associated with these economic hedges are included in mortgage banking noninterest income. Consistent with our longstanding approach to hedging interest rate risk in the mortgage business, the size of the hedge and the particular
combination of hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce the volatility of the mortgage business s earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Because market factors, the composition of the
mortgage servicing portfolio and the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our mortgage business change continually, the types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our evaluation of
current market factors and the interest rate risk inherent in our MSRs portfolio. Throughout 2011, our economic hedging strategy generally used forward mortgage purchase contracts that were effective at offsetting the impact of interest rates on the
value of the MSR asset.      Mortgage forward contracts are designed to pass the full economics of the underlying reference
mortgage securities to the holder of the contract, including both the directional gain or loss from the forward delivery of the reference securities and the corresponding carry income. Carry income represents the contract s price accretion from
the forward delivery price to the current spot price including both the yield earned on the reference securities and the market implied cost of financing during the period. The actual amount of carry income earned on the hedge each quarter will
depend on the amount of the underlying asset that is hedged and the particular instruments included in the hedge. The level of carry income is driven by the slope of the yield curve and other market driven supply and demand factors affecting the
specific reference securities. A steep yield curve generally produces higher carry income while a flat or inverted yield curve can result in lower or potentially negative carry income. The level of carry income is also affected by the type of
instrument used. In general, mortgage forward contracts tend to produce higher carry income than interest rate swap contracts. Carry income is recognized over the life of the mortgage forward as a component of the contract s mark to market gain
or loss.

Risk Management   Asset/Liability Management    (continued)       

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex
process that requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. While we attempt to balance these various aspects of the mortgage business, there are several potential risks to earnings:   

Valuation changes for MSRs associated with interest rate changes are recorded in earnings immediately within the accounting period in which those
interest rate changes occur, whereas the impact of those same changes in interest rates on origination and servicing fees occur with a lag and over time. Thus, the mortgage business could be protected from adverse changes in interest rates over a
period of time on a cumulative basis but still display large variations in income from one accounting period to the next.      

The degree to which the  natural business hedge  offsets valuation changes for MSRs is imperfect, varies at different points in the interest
rate cycle, and depends not just on the direction of interest rates but on the pattern of quarterly interest rate changes.      

Origination volumes, the valuation of MSRs and hedging results and associated costs are also affected by many factors. Such factors include the mix of
new business between ARMs and fixed-rate mortgages, the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates, the degree of volatility in interest rates, the relationship between mortgage interest rates and other interest rate markets, and
other interest rate factors. Many of these factors are hard to predict and we may not be able to directly or perfectly hedge their effect.      

While our hedging activities are designed to balance our mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial instruments we use may not perfectly
correlate with the values and income being hedged. For example, the change in the value of ARM production held for sale from changes in mortgage interest rates may or may not be fully offset by Treasury and LIBOR index-based financial instruments
used as economic hedges for such ARMs. Additionally, hedge-carry income on our economic hedges for the MSRs may not continue if the spread between short-term and long-term rates decreases, we shift composition of the hedge to more interest rate
swaps, or there are other changes in the market for mortgage forwards that affect the implied carry.         The
total carrying value of our residential and commercial MSRs was $14.0 billion and $15.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The weighted-average note rate on our portfolio of loans serviced for others was 5.14% and
5.39% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our total MSRs represented 0.76% of mortgage loans serviced for others at December 31, 2011, compared with 0.86% at December 31, 2010.   
  As part of our mortgage banking activities, we enter into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the
future. A mortgage loan commitment is an interest rate lock that binds us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period of time,

generally up to 60 days after inception of the rate lock. These loan commitments are derivative loan commitments if the loans that will result from the exercise of the commitments will be held
for sale. These derivative loan commitments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in their fair values recorded as part of mortgage banking noninterest income. The fair value of these commitments include, at inception and
during the life of the loan commitment, the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan as part of the fair value measurement of derivative loan commitments. Changes subsequent to inception are based on changes in
fair value of the underlying loan resulting from the exercise of the commitment and changes in the probability that the loan will not fund within the terms of the commitment, referred to as a fall-out factor. The value of the underlying loan
commitment is affected primarily by changes in interest rates and the passage of time.      Outstanding derivative loan
commitments expose us to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments might decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan. To minimize this risk, we employ
forwards and options, Eurodollar futures and options, and Treasury futures, forwards and options contracts as economic hedges against the potential decreases in the values of the loans. We expect that these derivative financial instruments will
experience changes in fair value that will either fully or partially offset the changes in fair value of the derivative loan commitments. However, changes in investor demand, such as concerns about credit risk, can also cause changes in the spread
relationships between underlying loan value and the derivative financial instruments that cannot be hedged.       MARKET RISK   TRADING
ACTIVITIES     From a market risk perspective, our net income is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices and their implied volatilities. The primary purpose of our
trading businesses is to accommodate customers in the management of their market price risks. Also, we take positions based on market expectations or to benefit from price differences between financial instruments and markets, subject to risk limits
established and monitored by Corporate ALCO. All securities, foreign exchange transactions, commodity transactions and derivatives used in our trading businesses are carried at fair value. The Market and Institutional Risk Committee, which provides
governance and oversight over market risk-taking activities across the Company, establishes and monitors counterparty risk limits. The credit risk amount and estimated net fair value of all customer accommodation derivatives at December 31,
2011 and 2010 are included in Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. Open,  at risk  positions for all trading businesses are monitored by Corporate ALCO.

Table 40 presents net gains (losses) from trading activities attributable to the
following types of activity:       Table 40: Trading Activities    
    The amounts reflected in the table above capture only gains (losses) due to changes in fair value of
our trading positions and are reported within net gains (losses) on trading activities within noninterest income line item of the income statement. These amounts do not include interest income and other fees earned from related activities, which are
reported within interest income from trading assets and other fees within noninterest income line items of the income statement. Categorization of net gains (losses) from trading activities in the table above is based on our own definition of those
categories, as further described below, because no uniform industry definitions currently exist.      Customer accommodation
trading consists of security or derivative transactions conducted in an effort to help customers manage their market price risks and are done on their behalf or driven by their investment needs. For the majority of our customer accommodation trading
we serve as intermediary between buyer and seller. For example, we may enter into financial instruments with customers that use the instruments for risk management purposes and offset our exposure on such contracts by entering into separate
instruments. Customer accommodation trading also includes net gains related to market-making activities in which we take positions to facilitate expected customer order flow.      Economic hedges consist primarily of cash or derivative positions used to facilitate certain of our balance sheet risk management activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting or were not
designated in a hedge accounting relationship. Economic hedges may also include securities that we elected to carry at fair value with changes in fair value recorded to earnings in order to mitigate accounting measurement mismatches or avoid
embedded derivative accounting complexities.      Proprietary trading consists of security or derivative positions executed for
our own account based on market expectations or to benefit from price differences between financial instruments and markets. Proprietary trading activity is expected to be restricted by the Dodd-Frank Act prohibitions known as the  Volcker
Rule,  which has not yet been finalized. On October 11, 2011, federal banking agencies and the SEC issued for public comment proposed regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. We believe our definition of proprietary trading is consistent
with the proposed regulations. However, given that final rule-making is required by various governmental regulatory agencies to define proprietary trading within the context of the final  Volcker Rule,  our definition of proprietary
trading may change. We have reduced or exited certain business activities in anticipation of the final  Volcker Rule.  As discussed within the noninterest income section of our financial results, proprietary trading activity is not
significant to our financial results.   
 
   The fair value of our trading derivatives is reported in Notes 16 (Derivatives) and 17
(Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. The fair value of our trading securities is reported in Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.   
  The standardized approach for monitoring and reporting market risk for the trading activities consists of value-at-risk (VaR) metrics
complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing. VaR measures the worst expected loss over a given time interval and within a given confidence interval. We measure and report daily VaR at a 99% confidence interval based on actual changes
in rates and prices over the previous 250 trading days. The analysis captures all financial instruments that are considered trading positions. The average one-day VaR throughout 2011 was $29 million, with a lower bound of $19 million and an
upper bound of $42 million. The average one-day VaR for fourth quarter 2011 was $32 million, with a lower bound of $22 million and an upper bound of $42 million.       MARKET RISK   EQUITY MARKETS    We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage direct equity investments in start-up businesses, emerging
growth companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. These private equity investments are made within capital allocations approved
by management and the Board. The Board s policy is to review business developments, key risks and historical returns for the private equity investment portfolio at least annually. Management reviews the valuations of these investments at least
quarterly and assesses them for possible OTTI. For nonmarketable investments, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment and the expectations for that investment s cash flows and capital needs, the viability
of its business model and our exit strategy. Nonmarketable investments include private equity investments accounted for under the cost method and equity method. Private equity investments are subject to OTTI. Principal investments are carried at
fair value with net unrealized gains and losses reported in noninterest income.      As part of our business to support our
customers, we trade public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible bonds. We have risk mandates that govern these activities. We also have marketable equity securities in the securities available-for-sale portfolio, including
securities relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these investments within capital risk limits approved by management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in net income
when realized and periodically include OTTI charges.      Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect our net
income by affecting (1) the value of third party assets under management and, hence, fee income, (2) particular borrowers, whose ability to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock market, or (3) brokerage
activity, related commission income and other business activities. Each business line monitors and manages these indirect risks.

   LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING     The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan requests,
customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, the Corporate ALCO establishes and
monitors liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. We set these guidelines for both the consolidated balance
sheet and for the Parent to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiaries.      Unencumbered debt and equity securities in the securities available-for-sale portfolio provide asset liquidity, in addition to the immediately liquid resources of cash and due from banks and federal funds
sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and other short-term investments. The weighted-average expected remaining maturity of the debt securities within this portfolio was 4.9 years at December 31, 2011. Of the
$212.6 billion (cost basis) of debt securities in this portfolio at December 31, 2011, $38.5 billion (18%) is expected to mature or be prepaid in 2012 and an additional $34.8 billion (16%) in 2013. Asset liquidity is
further enhanced by our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) and the FRB. In 2011, we sold or securitized mortgage loans of
$353 billion. The amount of mortgage loans and other consumer loans available to be sold, securitized or pledged was approximately $222 billion at December 31, 2011.   
  Core customer deposits have historically provided a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. At December

31, 2011, core deposits funded 113% of total loans compared with 105% a year ago. Additional funding is provided by long-term debt (including trust preferred securities), other foreign
deposits, and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt averaged $141.1 billion in 2011 and $185.4 billion in 2010. Short-term borrowings averaged $51.8 billion in 2011 and $46.8 billion in 2010.   
  We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $930 million in 2012 for our stores, relocation and remodeling of our
facilities, and routine replacement of furniture, equipment and servers. We fund expenditures from various sources, including funds from operations and borrowings.      In mid-2009, we froze the Wells Fargo   Company Cash Balance Plan. As a result, pension funding is not a material consideration in our liquidity management. See Note 20 (Employee Benefits and
Other Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on pension and postretirement plans.      We
access domestic and international capital markets for long-term funding through issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and asset-backed secured funding. Investors in the long-term capital markets generally will consider, among
other factors, a company s debt rating in making investment decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of Federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating;
however, a reduction in credit rating would not cause us to violate any of our debt covenants.      In September 2011,
Moody s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s) downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the Parent s significant banking subsidiary, one notch to A2 and Aa3, respectively, based on its
determination that, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. government is less likely to support systemically important financial institutions, if needed, in the future. Moody s outlook on the Parent s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. s
long-term senior debt ratings is negative based on the possibility that Moody s may further reduce its assumptions about the likelihood of government support for systemically important financial institutions. In November 2011, S P lowered
the long-term senior debt ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. one notch to A+ and AA-, respectively, following changes in S P s ratings criteria for the global banking industry. S P also reduced the Parent s short-term
debt ratings one notch to A-1, affirmed Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. s short-term debt rating at A-1+ and maintained a negative outlook on the Parent s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. s long-term debt, reflecting the outlook on the U.S.
sovereign rating in light of the amount of U.S. government support incorporated into our ratings. In July 2011, Fitch Ratings affirmed both the Parent s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. s long-term senior and short-term debt ratings and
maintained a stable watch on those ratings. In March 2011, Dominion Bond   

82   

Rating Service (DBRS) confirmed both the Parent s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. s long-term senior and short-term debt ratings, including the stable trend. The Moody s and
S P s ratings downgrades have not adversely affected our ability to access the capital markets and we do not believe there has been any meaningful change in our borrowing costs specifically relating to the ratings downgrades. See the
 Risk Factors  section of this Report for additional information regarding our credit ratings

and the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on our liquidity and operations, as well as Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding additional
collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.      The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as of December 31, 2011, are presented in Table 42.

On December 20, 2011, the FRB proposed enhanced liquidity planning rules that would
be applicable to us. The proposed rules, among other things, require periodic stress testing, the preparation of contingent funding plans, and the establishment of corporate governance procedures for managing liquidity risk. These rules, however,
are not yet final. We will continue to analyze the proposed rules and other regulatory proposals that may impact liquidity management, including Basel III, to determine the level of operational or compliance impact to Wells Fargo. For additional
information see the  Capital Management  and  Regulatory Reform  sections in this Report.       Parent  Under SEC rules,
the Parent is classified as a  well-known seasoned issuer,  which allows it to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. In June 2009, the Parent filed a registration statement with the
SEC for the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, preferred stock and other securities. The Parent s ability to issue debt and other securities under this registration statement is limited by the debt issuance authority granted
by the Board. The Parent is currently authorized by the Board to issue $60 billion in outstanding short-term debt and $170 billion in outstanding long-term debt. During 2011, the Parent issued $9.3 billion in registered senior notes. In February
2011, the Parent remarketed $2.5 billion of junior subordinated notes owned by an unconsolidated, wholly owned trust. The purchasers of the junior subordinated notes exchanged them with the Parent for newly issued senior notes, which are included in
the Parent issuances described above. Proceeds of the remarketed junior subordinated notes were used by the trust to purchase $2.5 billion of Class A, Series I Preferred Stock issued by the Parent. In February 2012, the Parent issued $3.3
billion in registered senior notes.      Parent s proceeds from securities issued in 2011 and in first quarter 2012 were
used for general corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the same purposes.

Depending on market conditions, we may purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or otherwise.   
  Table 43 provides information regarding the Parent s medium-term note (MTN) programs. The Parent may issue senior and subordinated
debt securities under Series I   J, and the European and Australian programmes. Under Series K, the Parent may issue senior debt securities linked to one or more indices or bearing interest at a fixed or floating rate.

   Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is authorized by its board of directors to issue $100 billion in outstanding
short-term debt and $125 billion in outstanding long-term debt. At December 31, 2011, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had available $100 billion in short-term debt issuance authority and $103.7 billion in long-term debt issuance
authority.       Wells Fargo Canada Corporation  In January 2012, Wells Fargo Canada Corporation (WFCC, formerly known as Wells
Fargo Financial Canada Corporation), an indirect wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of the Parent, qualified with the Canadian provincial securities commissions a base shelf prospectus for the distribution from time to time in Canada of up

83   

Risk Management   Asset/Liability Management    (continued)       

to CAD$7.0 billion in medium-term notes. During 2011, WFCC issued CAD$500 million in medium-term notes
using its prior base shelf prospectus. In February 2012, WFCC issued CAD$1.5 billion in medium-term notes. All medium-term notes issued by WFCC are unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent.       FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  We are a member of the Federal Home Loan Banks based in Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco (collectively, the FHLBs). Each member of each of the FHLBs is
required to maintain a minimum 

investment in capital stock of the applicable FHLB.   The board of directors of each FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional
capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Board. Because the extent of any
obligation to increase our investment in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential future payments to the FHLBs are not determinable.  

Capital
Management            

We have an active program for managing stockholders  equity and regulatory capital and maintain a
comprehensive process for assessing the Company s overall capital adequacy. We generate capital primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile
and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. Our potential sources of stockholders  equity include retained earnings and issuances of common and preferred stock. Retained earnings increased
$12.5 billion from December 31, 2010, predominantly from Wells Fargo net income of $15.9 billion, less common and preferred stock dividends of $3.4 billion. During 2011, we issued approximately 86 million shares of
common stock, substantially all of which related to employee benefit plans. We also repurchased approximately 86 million shares of common stock at a net cost of $2.4 billion during 2011.       Regulatory Capital Guidelines       The Company and each of our subsidiary banks are subject to
various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At
December 31, 2011, the Company and each of our subsidiary banks were  well-capitalized  under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. See Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial
Statements in this Report for additional information.      Current regulatory RBC rules are based primarily on broad credit-risk
considerations and limited market-related risks, but do not take into account other types of risk facing a financial services company. Our capital adequacy assessment process contemplates a wide range of risks that the Company is exposed to and also
takes into consideration our performance under a variety of stressed economic conditions, as well as regulatory expectations and guidance, rating agency viewpoints and the view of capital markets participants.   
  In 2007, U.S. bank regulators approved a final rule adopting international guidelines for determining regulatory capital known as
 Basel II.  Basel II incorporates three pillars that address (a) capital adequacy, (b) supervisory review, which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes, and (c) market discipline, through
increased disclosure requirements. We are well underway toward Basel II

implementation and currently anticipate entering the  parallel run phase  of Basel II in 2012. During the  parallel run phase,  banks must successfully complete at least a
four quarter evaluation period under supervision from regulatory agencies in order to be compliant with the Basel II final rule. Our delayed entry into the  parallel run phase  was approved by the FRB in 2010 as a result of our acquisition
of Wachovia.      In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) finalized a set of international guidelines
for determining regulatory capital known as  Basel III.  These guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and address many of the weaknesses identified in the banking sector as contributing to the crisis
including excessive leverage, inadequate and low quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers. The guidelines, among other things, increase minimum capital requirements and when fully phased in require bank holding companies to maintain a
minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%. The U.S. regulatory bodies are reviewing the final international standards and final U.S. rulemaking is expected to be completed in 2012.   
  The BCBS also proposed additional Tier 1 common equity surcharge requirements for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The
surcharge ranges from 1.0% to 3.5% depending on the bank s systemic importance to be determined under an indicator-based approach that would consider five broad categories: cross-jurisdictional activity, size, inter-connectedness,
substitutability/ financial institution infrastructure and complexity. These additional capital requirements, which would be phased in beginning in January 2016 and become fully effective on January 1, 2019, would be in addition to the Basel
III 7.0% Tier 1 common equity requirement finalized in December 2010. The Financial Stability Board has determined that the Company is one of the initial 29 G-SIBs that would be subject to the surcharge, but has not yet determined the surcharge
amount for us and the other banks.      The FRB also recently proposed rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act that will impose
enhanced prudential standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs) such as Wells Fargo, including enhanced capital, stress testing and liquidity requirements. We are reviewing the proposed rules to determine their potential effect on our business.

84   

Although uncertainty exists regarding final capital rules, including the FRB s
approach to capital requirements, we evaluate the impact of Basel III on our capital ratios based on our interpretation of the proposed capital requirements and we estimate that our Tier 1 common equity ratio under the Basel III proposal exceeded
the fully phased-in minimum of 7.0% by 50 basis points at the end of 2011. This estimate is subject to change depending on final promulgation of Basel III capital rulemaking and interpretations thereof by regulatory authorities.   
  Table 44 and Table 45, which appear at the end of this Capital Management section, provide information regarding our Tier 1 common
equity calculation under Basel I and as estimated under Basel III, respectively.       Capital Planning    
  In connection with its increased focus on the adequacy of regulatory capital and risk management for large financial firms, the FRB required large banks
to submit a capital plan in early 2011 as part of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). Following submission of our capital plan on January 7, 2011, the FRB notified us on March 18, 2011, that it did not object to our 2011
capital plan. Since that notification, the Company took several capital actions, including increasing the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.12 a share, repurchasing $2.4 billion of our common stock, and redeeming $9.2 billion of trust preferred
securities that will no longer count as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposed Basel III capital standards.   
  In late 2011, the FRB finalized rules to require large BHCs to submit capital plans annually and to obtain regulatory approval before
making capital distributions. The rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a BHC s risk profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions.   
  Under the FRB s new capital plan rule, the 2012 CCAR will include a comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of
expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios, similar to the process the FRB relied upon to conduct the 2011 CCAR. As part of the 2012 CCAR, the FRB will also generate a
supervisory stress test driven by a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the Company to estimate performance. The FRB has indicated it will publish its estimates of performance under
this scenario on a BHC-specific basis. We submitted our board-approved 2012 capital plan to the FRB on January 6, 2012. We expect the FRB s response to our submission in March 2012.       Securities Repurchases       From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to repurchase
shares of our common stock. Although we announce when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including
block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase stock that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for

employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the FRB s response to our capital
plan.      In 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 25 million additional shares of our outstanding common
stock. In first quarter 2011, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 200 million shares. During 2011, we repurchased 80 million shares of our common stock in the open market and from our employee benefit plans and an
additional 6 million shares through a private forward repurchase transaction that settled in fourth quarter 2011. During fourth quarter 2011, we entered into a second forward repurchase transaction that settled in first quarter 2012 for
approximately 6 million shares of common stock. At December 31, 2011, we had utilized all previously remaining common stock repurchase authority from the 2008 authorization and had remaining authority from the 2011 authorization to
purchase approximately 117 million shares. For more information about share repurchases during 2011, see Part II, Item 5 of our 2011 Form 10-K and for additional information about our forward repurchase programs see Note 1 (Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.      Historically, our policy has been to repurchase
shares under the  safe harbor  conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume limitation on share repurchases
during a pending merger or acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all of the consideration. Our management may determine that during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe harbor would otherwise be available,
it is in our best interest to repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, including the standing daily volume
limitation that applies whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition.      In connection with our participation
in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), we issued to the U.S. Treasury Department warrants to purchase 110,261,688 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $34.01 per share expiring on October 28,
2018. The Board authorized the repurchase by the Company of up to $1 billion of the warrants. On May 26, 2010, in an auction by the U.S. Treasury, we purchased 70,165,963 of the warrants at a price of $7.70 per warrant. We have purchased an
additional 916,216 warrants since the U.S. Treasury auction. At December 31, 2011, there were 39,179,509 warrants outstanding and exercisable and $453 million of unused warrant repurchase authority. Depending on market
conditions, we may purchase from time to time additional warrants in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.       Securities Issuances       In March 2011, the Company issued 25,010 shares of Class A,
Series I Preferred Stock, with a par value of $2.5 billion to Wachovia Capital Trust III (Trust), an unconsolidated wholly owned trust. The Trust used the proceeds from the remarketing

Capital Management    (continued)       

of certain junior subordinated notes issued in connection with Wachovia s 2006 issuance of 5.80%
fixed-to-floating rate trust preferred securities to purchase the Series I Preferred Stock. The action completed the Company s and the Trust s obligations

under an agreement dated February 1, 2006, as amended, between the Trust and the Company (as successor to Wachovia Corporation).

  Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of
several broad risk categories according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The
resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.         Table

         86   

Regulatory Reform    

The past two years have witnessed a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives
that may substantially change how most U.S. financial services companies conduct business. The following highlights the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For additional
information about the regulatory reform matters discussed below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see Part I, Item 1  Regulation and Supervision  of our 2011 Form 10-K, and the  Capital Management, 
 Forward-Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors  sections and Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.       Dodd-Frank Act       The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform legislation
since the 1930s and is driving much of the current U.S. regulatory reform. The Dodd-Frank Act and many of its provisions became effective in July 2010 and July 2011. However, a number of its provisions still require extensive rulemaking, guidance,
and interpretation by regulatory authorities and many of the rules that have been proposed to implement its requirements remain open for public comment and have not been finalized. Where possible, the Company may, from time to time, estimate the
impact to the Company s financial results or business operations as a result of particular Dodd-Frank Act regulations. However, due to the uncertainty of pending regulations, the Company may be unable to make any such estimates. Accordingly, in
many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and its effects on the U.S. financial system and the Company still remain uncertain. The following provides additional information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including the current status of certain
of its rulemaking initiatives.       

Regulation of interchange fees (the Durbin Amendment) . On October 1, 2011, FRB rules limiting debit card interchange fees to those
 reasonable  and  proportional  to the transactions became effective. The rule generally established that the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction will be the sum of
21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An additional charge of up to 1 cent may be added if the issuer develops and implements fraud prevention policies and procedures that meet regulation
standards. As a result of the FRB s new rules, our fourth quarter 2011 debit card interchange fees were reduced by $365 million (pre-tax).      

Interest on business checking (Regulation Q repeal) . Effective July 21, 2011, banks are permitted to pay interest on business checking
accounts. We made changes to our affected products in anticipation of the repeal of Regulation Q. To date, our product changes and the repeal of Regulation Q have had a minimal impact on our business because of the low interest rate environment.

Asset-based deposit assessment base; other FDIC assessment changes . In 2011, the FDIC finalized regulations

to implement the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring a shift from deposits to assets as the basis for determining FDIC assessments. In addition, the FDIC approved changes to its assessment
rates to implement a new minimum designated reserve ratio and impose separate risk-based assessments on large banks. The FDIC has broad discretionary authority to increase assessments on large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo on a case by
case basis.      

Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities . The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter
derivatives. Included in this framework are certain  push-out  provisions affecting U.S. banks acting as dealers in commodity swaps, equity swaps and certain credit default swaps, which will require that these activities be conducted
through an affiliate. It also authorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to regulate swaps and security-based swaps respectively. During 2011, the CFTC and SEC proposed rules to implement derivatives regulation, including
clearing and trading requirements, data retention and reporting requirements, registration requirements, capital and margin requirements, business conduct standards, and customer eligibility requirements. At this time, the Company cannot predict the
financial impact of the rules to our swaps and securities-based swaps activities or estimate the costs of complying with the rules.      

Volcker Rule.  The Volcker Rule will prohibit banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning any interest in or sponsoring a
hedge fund or a private equity fund. In October 2011, federal banking agencies and the SEC issued for public comment proposed regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. The comment period ended on February 13, 2012, and the Volcker Rule will
become effective on July 21, 2012, regardless of the status of the rulemaking process. The proposed rules requested comments on over 1,300 questions and it is difficult to predict the content of the final rules. Although proprietary trading is
not significant to our financial results, and we have reduced or exited certain businesses in anticipation of the final rules, at this time the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule on our trading and investment activities
or financial results.      

Changes to asset-backed securities markets.  The Dodd-Frank Act will generally require sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to hold at least
a 5% ownership stake in the ABS. Exemptions from the requirement include qualified residential mortgages and FHA/VA loans. Federal regulatory authorities have proposed joint rules to implement this credit risk retention requirement, which rules
include an exemption for the GSE s mortgage-backed securities. The proposed rules have been subject to extensive public comment. At this time, the Company cannot predict the financial impact of the credit risk retention requirement on our
business.      

87   

Regulatory Reform   (continued)      

The Collins Amendment.  This provision of the Dodd-Frank Act will phase out the benefit of issuing trust preferred securities by eliminating them
from Tier 1 capital over three years beginning January 2013. We redeemed $9.2 billion of our trust preferred securities in 2011 as discussed in the  Capital Management  section of this Report.      

Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically significant firms . The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to banking regulators to
establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. In December 2011, the FRB published proposed rules that would establish enhanced risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity
requirements, counterparty credit exposure limits, risk management requirements, stress testing requirements, debt-to-equity limits, and early remediation requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the
Financial Services Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new systemic risk management requirements and require new reporting of systemic risks.      

Establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which became operational on
July 21, 2011. The role of the CFPB is to ensure consumers get clear, accurate information to effectively evaluate mortgages, credit cards and other financial products and protect them from hidden fees, abusive terms and deceptive
practices. The CFPB has broad rulemaking powers and supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has begun exercising its supervisory authority over the banks under its jurisdiction,
including Wells Fargo, and is preparing for supervision of certain non-bank entities. The CFPB has indicated it will concentrate much of its rulemaking effort in 2012 on the variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank
Act, including the steering of consumers to certain products, discrimination, abusive or unfair lending practices, predatory lending, origination disclosures, minimum mortgage underwriting standards, and servicing practices. The CFPB has
published proposed regulations on several of these topics, including minimum mortgage underwriting standards (ability to repay). At this time, the Company cannot predict the content of final CFPB regulations and impacts on our business practices or
financial results.          Regulatory Capital Guidelines and Capital Plans    
  In December 2010, the BCBS finalized Basel III for determining regulatory capital. When fully phased in by 2019, the Basel III standards will require BHCs
to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%. In November 2011, the BCBS released its final rule for a common equity surcharge on certain designated G-SIBs. We have been named as one of the G-SIBs that
will be subject to a surcharge, although the amount of the surcharge, ranging from 1.0% to 3.5%, has not been determined. The FRB has indicated it expects to adopt regulations implementing the G-SIB surcharge in 2014 and that the surcharge would be
imposed on a phased-in basis from 2016-2019. In late 2011, the FRB finalized rules

to require BHCs with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets to submit capital plans annually and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions. The rule also requires a
capital adequacy assessment under a range of expected and stress scenarios. For additional information, see the  Capital Management  section of this Report.        Living Will  Requirements       In late 2011 the FRB and the FDIC approved final
resolution-plan regulations as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations will require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to prepare and periodically revise plans that would facilitate their resolution in the event of
material distress or failure. As contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act, resolution plans are to provide for a rapid and orderly resolution   liquidation or orderly restructuring   under Bankruptcy Code and other insolvency statutes applicable
to particular types of regulated entities (such as securities broker-dealers or insurance companies).   

88   

Critical Accounting Policies    

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial
Statements in this Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results.
Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under
different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern:   

the allowance for credit losses;      

PCI loans;      

the valuation of residential MSRs;      

liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses;      

the fair valuation of financial instruments; and      

income taxes.         Management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the Board s Audit and Examination Committee.   
   Allowance for Credit Losses       The
allowance for credit losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date, excluding loans
carried at fair value. We develop and document our allowance methodology at the portfolio segment level. Our loan portfolio consists of a commercial loan portfolio segment and a consumer loan portfolio segment.   
  We employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for credit losses. The total allowance for credit losses
considers both impaired and unimpaired loans. While our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio
and unfunded credit commitments. No single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.       COMMERCIAL
PORTFOLIO SEGMENT  The allowance for credit losses for unimpaired commercial loans is estimated through the application of loss factors to loans based on credit risk ratings for each loan. In addition, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded
commitments, including letters of credit, is estimated by applying these loss factors to loan equivalent exposures. The loss factors reflect the estimated default probability and quality of the underlying collateral. The loss factors used are
statistically derived through the observation of historical losses incurred for loans within each credit risk rating over a relevant specified period of time. As appropriate, we adjust or supplement these loss factors and estimates to reflect other
risks that may be identified from current conditions and developments in selected portfolios.      The allowance also includes an
amount for estimated credit losses on impaired loans such as nonaccrual loans and loans that have been modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.   

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SEGMENT  Loans are pooled generally by product type with similar risk
characteristics. Losses are estimated using forecasted losses to represent our best estimate of inherent loss based on historical experience, quantitative and other mathematical techniques over the loss emergence period. Each business group
exercises significant judgment in the determination of the credit loss estimation model that fits the credit risk characteristics of its portfolio. We use both internally developed and vendor supplied models in this process. We often use roll rate
or net flow models for near-term loss projections, and vintage-based models, behavior score models, and time series or statistical trend models for longer-term projections. Management must use judgment in establishing additional input metrics for
the modeling processes, considering further stratification into sub-product, origination channel, vintage, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. In addition, we establish an allowance for consumer loans modified in a
TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.      The models used to determine the allowance are validated by an independent
internal model validation group operating in accordance with Company policies.       OTHER ACL MATTERS  The allowance for credit losses for
both portfolio segments includes an amount for imprecision or uncertainty that may change from period to period. This amount represents management s judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance.
This imprecision considers economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and ongoing discussions with regulatory and government agencies regarding mortgage
foreclosure-related matters.      Impaired loans, which predominantly include nonaccrual commercial loans and any loans that have
been modified in a TDR, have an estimated allowance calculated as the difference, if any, between the impaired value of the loan and the recorded investment in the loan. The impaired value of the loan is generally calculated as the present value of
expected future cash flows from principal and interest, which incorporates expected lifetime losses, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate. The allowance for an unimpaired loan is based solely on principal losses without
consideration for timing of those losses. The allowance for an impaired loan that was modified in a TDR may be lower than the previously established allowance for that loan due to benefits received through modification, such as lower probability of
default and/or severity of loss, and the impact of prior charge-offs or charge-offs at the time of the modification that may reduce or eliminate the need for an allowance.      Commercial and consumer PCI loans may require an allowance subsequent to their acquisition. This allowance requirement is due to probable decreases in expected principal and interest cash flows (other
than due to decreases in interest rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions).   

89   

Critical Accounting Policies    (continued)       

SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES  Changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in the related
provision expense can materially affect net income. The establishment of the allowance for credit losses relies on a consistent quarterly process that requires significant management review and judgment. Management considers changes in economic
conditions, customer behavior, and collateral value, among other influences. From time to time, economic factors or business decisions, such as the addition or liquidation of a loan product or business unit, may affect the loan portfolio, causing
management to provide or release amounts from the allowance for credit losses.      The allowance for credit losses for
commercial loans, including unfunded credit commitments (individually risk weighted) is sensitive to credit risk ratings assigned to each credit exposure. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior
credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists.      The allowance for
credit losses for consumer loans (statistically modeled) is sensitive to economic assumptions and delinquency trends. Forecasted losses are modeled using a range of economic scenarios.   
  Assuming a one risk rating downgrade throughout our commercial portfolio segment, a more pessimistic economic outlook for modeled losses
on our consumer portfolio segment and incremental deterioration in our PCI portfolio could imply an additional allowance requirement of approximately $11.0 billion.      Assuming a one risk rating upgrade throughout our commercial portfolio segment and a more optimistic economic outlook for modeled losses on our consumer portfolio segment could imply a reduced allowance
requirement of approximately $3.1 billion.      The sensitivity analyses provided are hypothetical scenarios and are not
considered probable. They do not represent management s view of inherent losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Because significant judgment is used, it is possible that others performing similar analyses could reach different
conclusions.      See the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management  section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of our allowance.       Purchased Credit-Impaired (PCI) Loans
      Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where it is probable that we will not collect all
contractually required principal and interest payments are accounted for using the measurement provision for PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the historical allowance for credit losses related to these
loans is not carried over. Such loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield and not based on consideration given to contractual interest payments. Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired in the Wachovia
acquisition on December 31, 2008.   
 
   Management evaluated whether there was evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the
purchase date using indicators such as past due and nonaccrual status, commercial risk ratings, recent borrower credit scores and recent loan-to-value percentages.      The fair value at acquisition was based on an estimate of cash flows, both principal and interest, expected to be collected, discounted at the prevailing market rate of interest. We estimated the cash
flows expected to be collected at acquisition using our internal credit risk, interest rate risk and prepayment risk models, which incorporate our best estimate of current key assumptions, such as property values, default rates, loss severity and
prepayment speeds.      Substantially all commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual
loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation
of cash flows.      The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value (estimated fair value at
acquisition date) is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the
timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the
nonaccretable difference.      Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be
collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates, similar to our initial estimate of fair value. We must apply judgment to develop our estimates of cash flows for PCI loans given the
impact of home price and property value changes, changing loss severities, modification activity, and prepayment speeds.      If
we have probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected (other than due to decreases in interest rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions), we charge the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for
loan losses. If we have probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, we first reverse any previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the
remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans. Estimates of cash flows are impacted by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans and prepayment assumptions, both of which are treated as prospective yield adjustments included in
interest income.      Resolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with
the borrower, or foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the
nonaccretable difference for the entire pool. This removal method assumes that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The remaining

90   

accretable yield balance is unaffected and any material change in remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool.
For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are
not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed TDRs. Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting if there has been a concession granted in excess of the original
nonaccretable difference. We include these TDRs in our impaired loans.      The amount of cash flows expected to be collected
and, accordingly, the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss due to certain decreases in cash flows expected to be collected, is particularly sensitive to changes in loan credit quality. The sensitivity of the overall allowance for credit losses,
including PCI loans, is presented in the preceding section,  Critical Accounting Policies   Allowance for Credit Losses.       See the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management  section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of PCI loans.
      Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights       MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we purchase servicing rights from third parties, or retain servicing rights in connection with the
sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers). We also have MSRs acquired in the past under co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. We initially
measure and carry substantially all of our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans at fair value.      At the end of each
quarter, we determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing
income, including estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary
income and late fees.      Net servicing income, a component of mortgage banking noninterest income, includes the changes
from period to period in fair value of both our residential MSRs and the free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge our residential MSRs. Changes in the fair value of residential MSRs from period to period result from (1) changes
in the valuation model inputs or assumptions (principally reflecting changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in interest rates and costs to service, including delinquency and foreclosure costs), and
(2) other changes, representing changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.      We use a
dynamic and sophisticated model to estimate the value of our MSRs. The model is validated by an independent internal model validation group operating in accordance with

Company policies. Senior management reviews all significant assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speed   a key assumption in the model   is the annual rate at which borrowers
are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal. The discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income   another key assumption in the model   is the required rate of return investors in the
market would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow
accounts). Both assumptions can, and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and interest rates change. For example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption results in a decrease in the fair value of the
MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be
rapid and may be significant in the future. Therefore, estimating prepayment speeds within a range that market participants would use in determining the fair value of MSRs requires significant management judgment. Additionally, in recent years, we
have made significant adjustments to the assumptions for servicing and foreclosure costs as a result of an increase in the number of defaulted loans as well as changes in servicing processes associated with default and foreclosure management. While
our current valuation reflects our best estimate of these costs, future regulatory changes in servicing standards may have an impact on these assumptions and our MSR valuation in future periods.   
  The valuation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.       Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses       We sell residential mortgage loans to
various parties, including (1) GSEs, which include the mortgage loans in GSE-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) special purpose entities that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase mortgage
loans for investment or private label securitization. In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans, which back securities guaranteed by GNMA. The agreements under which we sell mortgage loans and the insurance or guaranty
agreements with FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans. Although the specific representations and warranties vary among different sales,
insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover ownership of the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, validity of the lien securing the loan, absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property
securing the loan, compliance with applicable origination laws, and other matters. For more information about these loan sales and the related risks that may result in liability see the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management  
Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses  section in this Report.

Critical Accounting Policies    (continued)       

We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust,
investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively  repurchase ) in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. Our loan sale contracts to private investors (non-GSE) typically contain an additional provision where we would only be required to repurchase loans if any such breach
is deemed to have a material and adverse effect on the value of the mortgage loan or to the interests of the investors or interests of security holders in the mortgage loan. The time periods specified in our mortgage loan sales contracts to respond
to repurchase requests vary, but are generally 90 days or less. While many contracts do not include specific remedies if the applicable time period for a response is not met, contracts for mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of
specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to inadequate responses to repurchase requests. Similarly, the agreements under which we sell mortgage loans require us to deliver various documents to the securitization trust or investor, and
we may be obligated to repurchase any mortgage loan for which the required documents are not delivered or are defective. In addition, as part of our representations and warranties in our loan sales contracts, we typically represent to GSEs and
private investors that certain loans have mortgage insurance to the extent there are loans that have loan to value ratios in excess of 80% that require mortgage insurance. To the extent the mortgage insurance is rescinded by the mortgage insurer due
to a claim of breach of a contractual representation or warranty, the lack of insurance may result in a repurchase demand from an investor. Upon receipt of a repurchase request or a mortgage insurance rescission, we work with securitization trusts,
investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution. Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the securitization trust, investor or insurer, and to determine whether
a contractually required repurchase event occurred. Occasionally, in lieu of conducting a loan level evaluation, we may negotiate global settlements in order to resolve a pipeline of demands in lieu of repurchasing the loans. We manage the risk
associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through our underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards.   
  We establish mortgage repurchase liabilities related to various representations and warranties that reflect management s estimate
of losses for loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Such factors include default expectations, expected investor repurchase demands (influenced by
current and expected mortgage loan file requests and mortgage insurance rescission notices, as well as estimated demand to default and file request relationships) and appeals success rates (where the investor rescinds the demand based on a cure of
the defect or acknowledges that the loan satisfies the investor s applicable representations and

warranties), reimbursement by correspondent and other third party originators, and projected loss severity. We establish a liability at the time loans are sold and continually update our
liability estimate during the remaining life of such loans. Although investors may demand repurchase at any time and there is often a lag from the date of default to the time we receive a repurchase demand, the majority of repurchase demands occur
on loans that default in the first 24 to 36 months following origination of the mortgage loan and can vary by investor. Most repurchases under our representation and warranty provisions are attributable to borrower misrepresentations and appraisals
obtained at origination that investors believe do not fully comply with applicable industry standards.      To date, repurchase
demands from private label MBS have been more limited than GSE-guaranteed securities; however, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans in private label securitizations may increase in frequency as investors explore every possible
avenue to recover losses on their securities. We evaluate the validity and materiality of any claim of breach of representations and warranties in private label MBS that is brought to our attention and work with securitization trustees to resolve
any repurchase requests. Nevertheless, we may be subject to legal and other expenses if private label securitization trustees or investors choose to commence legal proceedings in the event of disagreements.   
  The mortgage loan repurchase liability at December 31, 2011, represents our best estimate of the probable loss that we may incur
for various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage loans. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses are dependent on economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external conditions
that may change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgment. We maintain regular contact with the GSEs and other
significant investors to monitor and address their repurchase demand practices and concerns. For additional information on our repurchase liability, including an adverse impact analysis, see the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management
  Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses  section and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.       Fair Valuation of Financial Instruments       We use fair value measurements to record fair
value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Trading assets, securities available for sale, derivatives, prime residential MHFS, certain commercial LHFS, certain loans held for investment, principal
investments and securities sold but not yet purchased (short sale liabilities) are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as
certain MHFS and LHFS, loans held for investment and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Additionally, for financial
instruments not recorded at fair value we disclose the estimate of their fair value.   

92   

Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the financial asset or
paid to transfer the financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.      The
accounting provisions for fair value measurements include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to
the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data.

Level 1   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 1 instruments include securities traded
on active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange, as well as U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active OTC markets.      

Level 2   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques, such as matrix pricing, for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 2 instruments include securities traded in functioning dealer or broker markets,
plain-vanilla interest rate derivatives and MHFS that are valued based on prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics.      

Level 3   Valuation is generated primarily from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These
unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
        When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market-based or independently
sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques are not readily available, we
are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use to estimate the fair value.      The degree of
management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. For financial instruments with quoted market prices or
observable market parameters in active markets, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair
value. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of

quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on
unobservable inputs. When an active market for a financial instrument does not exist, the use of management estimates that incorporate current market participant expectations of future cash flows, adjusted for an appropriate risk premium, is
acceptable.      When markets for our financial assets and liabilities become inactive because the level and volume of activity
has declined significantly relative to normal conditions, it may be appropriate to adjust quoted prices. The methodology we use to adjust the quoted prices generally involves weighting the quoted prices and results of internal pricing techniques,
such as the net present value of future expected cash flows (with observable inputs, where available) discounted at a rate of return market participants require to arrive at the fair value. The more active and orderly markets for particular security
classes are determined to be, the more weighting we assign to quoted prices. The less active and orderly markets are determined to be, the less weighting we assign to quoted prices.   
  We may use independent pricing services and brokers (collectively,  pricing vendors ) to obtain fair values ( vendor
prices ) which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices. For certain securities, we may use internal traders to price instruments. Where vendor prices are utilized for recording the
price of an instrument, we determine the most appropriate and relevant pricing vendor for each security class and obtain a price from that particular pricing vendor for each security.   
  Determination of the fair value of financial instruments using either vendor prices or internally developed prices are both subject to
our internal price validation procedures, which include, but are not limited to, one or a combination of the following procedures:   

comparison to pricing vendors (for internally developed prices) or to other pricing vendors (for vendor developed prices);

variance analysis of prices;      

corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent market data such as secondary broker quotes and relevant benchmark indices;

review of pricing by Company personnel familiar with market liquidity and other market-related conditions; and      

investigation of prices on a specific instrument-by-instrument basis.      
  For instruments where we utilize vendor prices to record the price of an instrument, we perform additional procedures. We evaluate
pricing vendors by comparing prices from one vendor to prices of other vendors for identical or similar instruments and evaluate the consistency of prices to known market transactions when determining the level of reliance to be placed on a
particular pricing vendor. Methodologies employed and inputs used by independent pricing vendors are subject to additional review when such services are provided. This review may consist of, in part, obtaining and evaluating control reports issued
and pricing methodology materials distributed.   

93   

Critical Accounting Policies    (continued)       

Significant judgment is required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair
value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. When making this judgment, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and
significant inputs used. For securities in inactive markets, we use a predetermined percentage to evaluate the impact of fair value adjustments derived from weighting both external and internal indications of value to determine if the instrument is
classified as Level 2 or Level 3. Otherwise, the classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3
inputs to the instruments  fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3.      Our financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consisted of certain asset-backed securities, including those collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash reserves, private collateralized
mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), auction-rate securities, certain derivative contracts such as credit default swaps related to CMO, CDO and CLO exposures and certain MHFS
and MSRs. For additional information on how we value MSRs refer to the discussion earlier in this section.      Table 46 presents
the summary of the fair value of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs (before derivative netting adjustments). The fair value of the remaining assets and
liabilities were measured using valuation methodologies involving market-based or market-derived information, collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements.       Table 46: Fair Value Level 3 Summary

  Before derivative netting adjustments.     
  See Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on our use of fair
valuation of financial instruments, our related measurement techniques and the impact to our financial statements.       Income Taxes
      We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we

operate. Our income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and
includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions. We determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the
differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is  more likely than not.  Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Foreign taxes paid
are generally applied as credits to reduce federal income taxes payable. We account for interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.      The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. In
establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in
the various tax jurisdictions by the government taxing authorities, both domestic and foreign. Our interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax
positions. We attempt to resolve these disputes during the tax examination and audit process and ultimately through the court systems when applicable.      We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a quarterly
basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any given
quarter.      See Note 21 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for a further description of our provision for
income taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities.

Current Accounting Developments    

The following accounting pronouncements have been issued by the FASB but are not yet effective:   

Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2011-11,  Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities;       

ASU 2011-12,  Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05;       

ASU 2011-04,  Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs;  and

ASU 2011-03,  Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements.       
   ASU 2011-11  expands the disclosure requirements for financial instruments and derivatives that may be offset in accordance with enforceable master
netting agreements or similar arrangements. The disclosures are required regardless of whether the instruments have been offset (or netted) in the statement of financial position. Under ASU 2011-11, companies must describe the nature of offsetting
arrangements and provide quantitative information about those agreements, including the gross and net amounts of financial instruments that are recognized in the statement of financial position. These changes are effective for us in first quarter
2013 with retrospective application. This Update will not affect our consolidated financial results since it amends only the disclosure requirements for offsetting financial instruments.     
   ASU 2011-05  eliminates the option for companies to include the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in
stockholders  equity. This Update requires entities to present the components of comprehensive income in either a single statement or in two separate statements, with the statement of other comprehensive income (OCI) immediately following the
statement of income. This Update also requires companies to present amounts reclassified out of OCI and into net income on the face of the statement of income. In December 2011, the FASB issued  ASU 2011-12 , which defers indefinitely the
requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the statement of income. The remaining provisions are effective for us in first quarter 2012 with retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. This Update will not affect our
consolidated financial results as it amends only the presentation of comprehensive income.       ASU 2011-04  modifies accounting guidance
and expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This Update clarifies how fair values should be measured for instruments classified in stockholders  equity and under what circumstances premiums and discounts should be
applied in fair value measurements. This Update also permits entities to measure fair value on a net basis for financial instruments that are managed based on net exposure to market risks and/or

counterparty credit risk. ASU 2011-04 requires new disclosures for financial instruments classified as Level 3, including: 1) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used in measuring
fair value, 2) qualitative discussion of the sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in unobservable inputs, and 3) a description of valuation processes used. This Update also requires disclosure of fair value levels for financial
instruments that are not recorded at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed. This guidance is effective for us in first quarter 2012 with prospective application. Early adoption is not permitted. We will expand our fair
value disclosures upon adoption of this Update, but we do not expect the measurement clarifications will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.       ASU 2011-03  amends the criteria companies use to determine if repurchase and similar agreements should be accounted for as sales or financings. Specifically, this Update removes the criterion for
transferors to have the ability to meet contractual obligations through collateral maintenance provisions, even if transferees fail to return transferred assets pursuant to the agreements. This Update is effective for us in first quarter 2012 with
prospective application to new transactions and existing transactions modified on or after January 1, 2012. Early adoption is not permitted. We do not expect this Update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

95

materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future
performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following,
without limitation:   

current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of further declines in housing prices and high unemployment rates, U. S.
fiscal debt and budget matters, and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe;

our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the proposed Basel III capital standards, as determined
and interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;      

financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and
businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and legislation and regulation relating to overdraft fees (and changes to our overdraft practices as a result thereof), debit card interchange fees, credit cards, and other bank services, as well as the
extent of our ability to offset the loss of revenue and income from financial services reform and other legislation and regulation;      

the extent of our success in our loan modification efforts, as well as the effects of regulatory requirements or guidance regarding loan modifications
or changes in such requirements or guidance;      

the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without having to repurchase loans related
thereto or otherwise indemnify or reimburse third parties, and the credit quality of or losses on such repurchased mortgage loans;      

negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices, including our ability to meet our obligations under the settlement in
principle with the Department of Justice and other federal and state government entities, as well as changes in our procedures or practices and/or industry standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, penalties or fines, increased
servicing and other costs or obligations, including loan modification requirements, or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures;      

our ability to realize our noninterest expense target as part of our expense management initiatives when and in the amount targeted, including as a
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory
matters;      

our ability to successfully complete the remaining Wachovia integration activities, as well as realize all of the expected benefits of the Wachovia
merger;      

recognition of OTTI on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio;      

the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and our mortgage originations, MSRs and MHFS;      

hedging gains or losses;      

disruptions in the capital markets and reduced investor demand for mortgage loans;      

our ability to sell more products to our customers;      

the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management
businesses;      

our election to provide support to our money market funds;

96   

changes in the value of our venture capital investments;      

changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards or in how accounting standards are to be applied or interpreted;

mergers, acquisitions and divestitures;      

changes in the Company s credit ratings and changes in the credit quality of the Company s customers or counterparties;

reputational damage from negative publicity, protests, fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations and legal actions;

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers,
including as a result of cyber attacks;      

the loss of checking and savings account deposits to other investments such as the stock market, and the resulting increase in our funding costs and
impact on our net interest margin;      

fiscal and monetary policies of the FRB; and      

the other risk factors and uncertainties described under  Risk Factors  in this Report.

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that there is no assurance that our
allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if housing prices decline and unemployment worsens. Increases in loan charge-offs or in the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense could
materially adversely affect our financial results and condition.      Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Report
speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Risk Factors    

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment
could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below and elsewhere in this Report, including under  Forward-Looking Statements  and in our 2011 Form 10-K, as
well as in other documents we file with the SEC, risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition and the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company. There may be other factors not discussed below or elsewhere
in this Report or in our 2011 Form 10-K that could adversely affect our financial results and condition.       RISKS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY,
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES AND LIQUIDITY        As one of the largest lenders in the U.S. and a provider of financial products and
services to consumers and businesses across the U.S. and internationally, our financial results have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and
a deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition.  We generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans
and other products and services we sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and commercial lending and banking businesses, including our mortgage
banking business where we currently are the largest mortgage originator in the U.S. These

businesses have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. Although the U.S. economy has continued to
gradually improve from the levels of 2008 and early 2009, economic growth has been slow and uneven and the housing market remains weak. In addition, the negative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from the sovereign debt crisis and economic
difficulties in Europe and U. S. fiscal and political matters, including concerns about deficit reduction and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact the continuing global economic recovery. A prolonged period of slow growth in
the global economy, particularly in the U.S., or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or any other events or factors that may disrupt or dampen the global economic
recovery ,  could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition.      The high unemployment rate in the
U.S., together with high levels of unsold housing inventory and distressed property sales and the significant decline in home prices across the U.S., including in many of our large banking markets such as California and Florida, has resulted in
elevated credit costs and nonperforming asset levels, which have adversely affected our credit performance and our financial results and condition. If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices continue to fall we would expect to incur higher than
normal charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely
on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of   

97   

Risk Factors    (continued)     

these and other borrowers to repay their loans may be hurt, causing us, as one of the largest commercial lenders and the largest CRE lender in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit
losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Although we have significant
capacity to add loans to our balance sheet and there have been some early signs of increased borrower activity, loan demand, especially consumer loan demand, has been soft resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid
assets on our balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit
products, including our mortgages, may fall, reducing our interest and fee income and our earnings.      A deterioration in
business and economic conditions, which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our investment
advisory, mutual fund, securities brokerage, wealth management, and investment banking businesses. As a result of the Wachovia merger, a greater percentage of our revenue depends on our fee income from these businesses. We earn fee income from
managing assets for others and providing brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth management services. Because investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those assets
could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets
also can negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our trading and venture capital businesses. Extreme market volatility also could cause us to elect to provide capital support to our money market funds,
which would reduce our earnings. Our acquisition of Wachovia expanded our international businesses, particularly our global financial institution and correspondent banking services, and any deterioration in global financial markets and economies,
including as a result of Europe s sovereign debt crisis or any international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely affect the revenues and earnings of these and other businesses.   
  For more information, refer to the  Risk Management   Asset/Liability Management  and    Credit Risk
Management  sections in this Report.       Changes in interest rates and financial market values could reduce our net interest income and
earnings, including as a result of recognizing losses or OTTI on the securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.  Our net interest income is the interest we earn on   loans, debt securities   and other assets we
hold less the interest we pay on our deposits, long-term and short-term debt, and other liabilities. Net interest income is a measure of both our net interest margin   the difference between the yield we earn on 

our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding   and the amount of earning assets we hold. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount
or mix of earning assets we hold could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction
in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to
changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the asset yield increases.      
  The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our yield and net interest margin. We hold earning assets in the form of loans
and investment securities, among other assets. As noted above, if the economy remains weak or worsens we may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our net interest income and yield. In addition, our net interest income and
net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged low interest rate environment, which as noted below is currently being experienced as a result of economic conditions and FRB monetary policies, as it may result in us holding lower
yielding loans and securities on our balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher yielding assets on our balance sheet, including the loans in our non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolio, with similar higher
yielding assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, changes in interest rates
also affect our mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs.      Changes in the slope of the  yield curve 
  or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates   could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend
to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens, as is the case in the current interest rate environment, or even inverts, our net interest margin could decrease as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can
earn on our assets.      The interest we earn on our loans may be tied to U.S.-denominated interest rates such as the federal
funds rate while the interest we pay on our debt may be based on international rates such as LIBOR. If the federal funds rate were to fall without a corresponding decrease in LIBOR, we might earn less on our loans without any offsetting decrease in
our funding costs. This could lower our net interest margin and our net interest income.      We assess our interest rate risk by
estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest
rate derivatives. We also rely on the  natural hedge  that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide.

98   

We may not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always the risk that changes in
interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or
the slope of the yield curve changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios, refinance our debt and take other strategic
actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions.      We hold securities in our available-for-sale portfolio, including
U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities and federal agency MBS, securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, residential and commercial MBS, corporate debt securities, and marketable equity securities, including securities relating to
our venture capital activities. We analyze securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio for OTTI on at least a quarterly basis. The process for determining whether impairment is other than temporary usually requires difficult, subjective
judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and
market conditions, as well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize OTTI in future periods, thus reducing earnings. Our net income also is exposed to changes in interest
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices in connection with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to accommodate our customers in the management of their market price risk, as well as when we take
positions based on market expectations or to benefit from differences between financial instruments and markets. The securities held in these activities are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest
income. As part of our business to support our customers, we trade public securities and these securities also are subject to market fluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net income when realized and periodically include OTTI charges.
Although we have processes in place to measure and monitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including stress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding
losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.      Our venture capital business also is subject
to market risk and can be volatile from quarter to quarter. Certain of our venture capital businesses are carried under the cost or equity method, and others (e.g., principal investments) are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reflected in earnings. Our venture capital investments tend to be in technology and other volatile industries so the value of our public and private equity portfolios may fluctuate widely. Earnings from our venture capital investments may be
volatile and hard to predict and may have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of factors, including general economic and market conditions, the prospects of the
companies in which we invest, when these companies go public, the size of our position relative to the public float, and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions.

Our venture capital investments could result in significant losses, either OTTI losses
for those investments carried under the cost or equity method or mark-to-market losses for principal investments. Our assessment for OTTI is based on a number of factors, including the then current market value of each investment compared with its
carrying value. If we determine there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings. The amount of this charge could be significant. Further, our principal investing portfolio could
incur significant mark-to-market losses especially if the carrying value of these investments has increased because of higher market prices.      For more information, refer to the  Risk Management   Asset/Liability Management   Interest Rate Risk ,    Market Risk   Equity Markets , and    Market
Risk   Trading Activities  and the  Balance Sheet Analysis   Securities Available for Sale  sections in this Report and Note 5 (Securities Available for Sale) to Financial Statements in this Report.   
   Effective liquidity management, which ensures that we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash
commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances of industry or financial market stress, is essential for the operation of our business, and our financial results and condition could be materially
adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity.  Our liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. We primarily rely on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and the
operation of our business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and other savings, and certain foreign deposits, have historically provided us with a
sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of liquidity include investments in our securities portfolio, our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to
access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and international money and capital markets.      Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and volatility or
a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our
inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same
maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding
include a lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative news about the Company or the financial services

99   

Risk Factors    (continued)     

industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to
access the capital markets; our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and, as described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which we have
little or no control. While market conditions have improved since the financial crisis, there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For example, in the summer of 2011
concerns regarding the potential failure to raise the U.S. government debt limit and the eventual downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings caused uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. Although the U.S. debt limit was increased, a failure
to raise the U.S. debt limit in the future and/or additional downgrades of the sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal or political events
could, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability
to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition.      As noted above, we rely heavily on bank deposits for our funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on
deposits our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin and net interest
income. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of
bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our liquidity.      If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage
our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis, we may also need to raise additional capital through the issuance of common
stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or in order to raise additional capital.   
  For more information, refer to the  Risk Management   Asset/Liability Management  section in this Report.   
   Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and condition.  Our
borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely

affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions
that could adversely affect our ability to raise capital. Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies  outlooks are based on the ratings agencies  analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, the
level and quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing costs are affected
by various other external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry generally.      On September 21, 2011, Moody s downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. one notch to A2 and Aa3, respectively, based on its determination that, as a
result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. government is less likely to support systemically important financial institutions, if needed, than during the financial crisis. The short-term debt ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank were affirmed at
Prime-1. Moody s also indicated that its outlook on the Parent s and Wells Fargo Bank s long-term senior debt ratings is negative based on the possibility that Moody s may further reduce its assumptions about the likelihood of
systemic support for systemically important financial institutions. On November 29, 2011, S P lowered the long-term senior debt ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank one notch to A+ and AA-, respectively, following changes in
S P s ratings criteria for the global banking industry. S P also reduced the Parent s short-term debt rating one notch to A-1, affirmed Wells Fargo Bank s short-term debt rating at A-1+, and maintained a negative outlook on
the Parent s long-term debt reflecting the outlook on the U.S. sovereign rating in light of the amount of U.S. government support incorporated into our ratings. On July 15, 2011, Fitch Ratings affirmed both the Parent s and Wells
Fargo Bank s long-term senior debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at AA- and F1+, respectively, and maintained a stable watch on those ratings. On March 29, 2011, DBRS confirmed both the Parent s and Wells Fargo Bank s
long-term senior and short-term debt ratings, including the stable trend. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings.      Although the availability and cost of funding are influenced by credit ratings, to date the Moody s and S P ratings downgrades described above have not adversely affected our ability to access
the capital markets or fund our operations. While to date we do not believe there has been any meaningful change in our borrowing costs specifically relating to the ratings downgrades described above, there can be no assurance that more severe
credit ratings downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs.   
  Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our
liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. The Moody s and S P ratings downgrades described above have not triggered, and additional one and two notch downgrades in those
credit ratings would not be expected to trigger, a material increase in our collateral or funding obligations. However, in the event of a more

100   

severe credit rating downgrade of our long-term and short-term credit ratings, the increase in our collateral or funding obligations and the effect on our liquidity could be material. For
information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.
      We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state law can limit those dividends.  Wells Fargo  
Company, the parent holding company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives a significant portion of its funding and liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these
dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank
subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to our parent holding company. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the
subsidiary s creditors.      For more information, refer to the  Regulation and Supervision   Dividend
Restrictions  and    Holding Company Structure  sections in our 2011 Form 10-K and to Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.
      RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS    
   Enacted legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain
of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary banks and many of our nonbank
subsidiaries such as those related to our retail brokerage and mutual fund businesses, are subject to significant regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of the U.S.
where we conduct business. These regulations protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, investors and the banking and financial system as a whole, not necessarily our stockholders. Economic, market and political conditions
during the past few years have led to a significant amount of new legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad. These laws and regulations may affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, affect or
restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our revenue in businesses or impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision
of us and the financial services industry, and

adversely affect our business operations or have other negative consequences.      For example, in 2009 several legislative and regulatory initiatives were adopted that affected revenue in 2011 and will continue to affect our businesses and financial results, including FRB amendments to
Regulation E, which affect the way we may charge overdraft fees, and the enactment of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the Card Act), which affects our ability to change interest rates and assess certain fees
on card accounts. We also implemented policy changes to help customers limit overdraft and returned item fees. The continuing impact of these laws and regulations on our future revenue could vary materially due to a variety of factors, including
changes in customer behavior, economic conditions and other potential offsetting factors.      On July 21, 2010, the
Dodd-Frank Act, the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s, became law. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, (i) established the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risk posed by financial firms
and imposes additional and enhanced FRB regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, on certain large, interconnected bank holding companies such as Wells Fargo and systemically significant nonbanking firms intended to promote
financial stability; (ii) creates a liquidation framework for the resolution of covered financial companies, the costs of which would be paid through assessments on surviving covered financial companies; (iii) makes significant changes to
the structure of bank and bank holding company regulation and activities in a variety of areas, including prohibiting proprietary trading and private fund investment activities, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) creates a new framework for
the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and new regulations for the securitization market and strengthens the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets by the SEC; (v) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) within the FRB, which has sweeping powers to administer and enforce a new federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation; (vi) may limit the existing pre-emption of state laws with respect to the application of such laws
to national banks, makes federal pre-emption no longer applicable to operating subsidiaries of national banks, and gives state authorities, under certain circumstances, the ability to enforce state laws and federal consumer regulations against
national banks; (vii) provides for increased regulation of residential mortgage activities; (viii) revised the FDIC s assessment base for deposit insurance by changing from an assessment base defined by deposit liabilities to a
risk-based system based on total assets; (ix) phases out over three years beginning January 2013 the Tier 1 capital treatment of trust preferred securities; (x) permitted banks to pay interest on business checking accounts beginning on
July 1, 2011; (xi) authorized the FRB under the Durbin Amendment to adopt regulations that limit debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers; and (xii) includes several corporate governance and executive compensation
provisions and requirements, including mandating an advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation.   

101   

Risk Factors (continued)    

The Dodd-Frank Act and many of its provisions became effective in July 2010 and July
2011. However, a number of its provisions still require extensive rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by regulatory authorities. Accordingly, in many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and its effects on the U.S. financial
system and the Company still remain uncertain. Nevertheless, the Dodd-Frank Act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, could result in a loss of revenue, require us to change certain of
our business practices, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our capital requirements and impose additional assessments and costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business operations and have other negative
consequences. For example, as a result of the FRB s new rules limiting debit card interchange fees, our fourth quarter 2011 debit card interchange fees were reduced by $365 million (pre-tax). Although we expect to recapture a portion of our
lost income over time through volume and product changes, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to mitigate the negative impact to our financial results from the Durbin Amendment.   
  In addition, our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending businesses, may be
negatively affected by the activities of the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking powers and supervisory authority over consumer financial products and services. Although the full impact of the CFPB on our businesses is uncertain, the CFPB s
activities may increase our compliance costs and require changes in our business practices as a result of new regulations and requirements which could limit or negatively affect the products and services that we currently offer our customers. As a
result of greater regulatory scrutiny of our consumer businesses, we also may become subject to more or expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations, which also could result in increased costs and harm to our reputation in the event of a
failure to comply with the increased regulatory requirements.      The Dodd-Frank Act s proposed prohibitions or limitations
on proprietary trading and private fund investment activities, known as the  Volcker Rule,  also may reduce our revenue and earnings, although proprietary trading has not been significant to our financial results. The Volcker Rule is
subject to final rulemaking and interpretation, and the ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule on our investment activities, including our venture capital business, is uncertain.   
  Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly affect our business include proposals to reform the housing finance market
in the United States. These proposals, among other things, consider winding down the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as the implementation of
reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of a loan that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, improving underwriting standards,
and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. As recently proposed by the Obama administration, Congress also may consider the adoption of legislation to reform the mortgage

financing market in an effort to assist borrowers experiencing difficulty in making mortgage payments or refinancing their mortgages. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the
adoption of any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company s business and financial results, are uncertain.      Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, also could significantly change our regulatory environment and increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue or affect
the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial services companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.   
  For more information, refer to the  Regulatory Reform  section in this Report and the  Regulation and Supervision 
section in our 2011 Form 10-K.       Bank regulations, including Basel capital standards and FRB guidelines and rules, may require higher
capital and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our business or provide loans to our customers.  Federal banking regulators continually monitor the capital position of banks
and bank holding companies. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision finalized a set of international guidelines for determining regulatory capital known as Basel III. These guidelines are designed to address many of the weaknesses
identified in the banking sector as contributing to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 by, among other things, increasing minimum capital requirements, increasing the quality of capital, increasing the risk coverage of the capital framework, and
increasing standards for the supervisory review process and public disclosure. When fully phased in, the Basel III guidelines require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at least
7.0%. The Basel Committee also proposed certain liquidity coverage and funding ratios. In June 2011, the Basel Committee proposed additional Tier 1 common equity surcharge requirements for global systemically important banks ranging from 1.0% to
3.5% depending on the bank s systemic importance to be determined based on certain factors. This new capital surcharge, which would be phased in beginning in January 2016 and become fully effective on January 1, 2019, would be in addition
to the Basel III 7.0% Tier 1 common equity requirement proposed in December 2010. The Company has been identified as one of the initial 29 global systemically important banks that would be subject to the surcharge, but the surcharge amount has not
yet been determined. The U.S. regulatory bodies are reviewing the final international standards, and the ultimate impact of the Basel III standards on our capital and liquidity will depend on such final rulemaking and regulatory interpretations of
the rules as we, along with our regulatory authorities, apply the final rules during the implementation process.      As part of
its obligation to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB issued a final capital plan rule that became effective December 30, 2011. The final capital plan rule

102   

requires top-tier U.S. bank holding companies, including the Company, to submit annual capital plans for
review and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions. There can be no assurance that the FRB would respond favorably to the Company s future capital plans. The FRB also recently proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act
that will impose enhanced prudential standards on large bank holding companies such as the Company, including enhanced capital, stress testing, and liquidity requirements.      The Basel standards and FRB regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may
require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which
may negatively affect our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, the proposed Basel capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute the
ownership of existing stockholders.      For more information, refer to the  Capital Management  and  Regulatory
Reform  sections in this Report and the  Regulation and Supervision  section of our 2011 Form 10-K.       FRB policies, including
policies on interest rates, can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for
lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB s interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we
hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. As a
result of the FRB s concerns regarding, among other things, continued slow economic growth and a weak housing market, the FRB recently indicated that it intends to keep the target range for the federal funds rate near zero at least through late
2014. The FRB also may increase its purchases of U.S. government and mortgage-backed securities or take other actions in an effort to reduce or maintain low long-term interest rates. As noted above, a declining or low interest rate environment and a
flattening yield curve which may result from the FRB s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest margin as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and investment securities on our balance sheet.
      RISKS RELATED TO CREDIT AND OUR MORTGAGE BUSINESS        As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions, could require us to increase our provision for   credit losses
and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our 

results of operations and financial condition.  When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of
the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. As noted above, if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may have
difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this
allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires
difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic
conditions, including falling home prices and higher unemployment, or other factors. For example, changes in borrower behavior or the regulatory environment also could influence recognition of credit losses in the portfolio and our allowance for
credit losses.      Reflecting the continued improved credit performance in our loan portfolios, our provision expense was $3.4
billion and $2.0 billion less than net charge-offs in 2011 and 2010, respectively, which had a positive effect on our earnings. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future allowance releases in 2012, although at more modest
levels. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2011, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the
event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings.      For more information, refer to the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management  and  Critical Accounting Policies   Allowance for Credit Losses  sections in this Report.
      We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower
type, or location of the borrower or collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or
disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. We experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected losses in our home equity loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater than
expected deterioration in residential real estate values in many markets, including the Central Valley California market and several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and
deposits, continued deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially higher credit losses. As a result of the Wachovia merger, we have

103   

Risk Factors    (continued)     

increased our exposure to California, as well as to Arizona and Florida, two states that have also suffered
significant declines in home values, as well as significant declines in economic activity. Deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and real estate values in these states and generally across the country could result in materially
higher credit losses, including for our home equity portfolio.      The Wachovia merger also increased our CRE exposure,
particularly in California and Florida, and we are currently the largest CRE lender in the U.S. A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases in interest rates
and/or declines in commercial property values, could result in materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.      The European debt crisis, which has resulted in deteriorating economic conditions in Europe and ratings agency downgrades of the sovereign debt ratings of several European countries, has increased foreign
credit risk. Although our foreign loan exposure represented only approximately 5% of our total consolidated outstanding loans and 3% of our total assets at December 31, 2011, continued European economic difficulties could indirectly have a
material adverse effect on our credit performance and results of operations and financial condition to the extent it negatively affects the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have foreign operations.   
  For more information, refer to the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management  section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.       We may incur losses on loans, securities and other acquired assets of Wachovia that
are materially greater than reflected in our fair value adjustments.  We accounted for the Wachovia merger under the purchase method of accounting, recording the acquired assets and liabilities of Wachovia at fair value. All PCI loans acquired in
the merger were recorded at fair value based on the present value of their expected cash flows. We estimated cash flows using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models using assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We
may not realize the estimated cash flows or fair value of these loans. In addition, although the difference between the pre-merger carrying value of the credit-impaired loans and their expected cash flows   the  nonaccretable
difference    is available to absorb future charge-offs, we may be required to increase our allowance for credit losses and related provision expense because of subsequent additional credit deterioration in these loans.   
  For more information, refer to the  Critical Accounting Policies   Purchased Credit-Impaired (PCI) Loans  and  Risk
Management   Credit Risk Management  sections in this Report.       Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to
quarter, including as a result of changes in interest rates and the value of our MSRs and MHFS, and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to 

fund new mortgage loans.  We were the largest mortgage originator and residential mortgage servicer in the U.S. as of December 31, 2011, and we earn revenue from fees we receive for
originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a sizeable portfolio of MSRs. An MSR is the right to service a mortgage loan   collect principal, interest and escrow amounts
  for a fee. We acquire MSRs when we keep the servicing rights after we sell or securitize the loans we have originated or when we purchase the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other lenders. We initially measure and carry
substantially all our residential MSRs using the fair value measurement method. Fair value is the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of
prepayment by borrowers. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the
likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Each quarter we evaluate the fair value of our MSRs, and any decrease in fair value reduces earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. We also measure at fair
value prime MHFS for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist. In addition, we measure at fair value certain other interests we hold related to residential loan sales and securitizations. Similar to other
interest-bearing securities, the value of these MHFS and other interests may be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. For example, if market interest rates increase relative to the yield on these MHFS and other interests, their fair
value may fall.      When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from
loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some
offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a  natural hedge,  the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSRs is generally
immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market
similar to current market conditions, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower
rates.      We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We generally do
not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. We may use hedging instruments tied to U.S.
Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. We could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. There may be periods where we elect not to use derivatives and other
instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.   

104   

We sell most of the mortgage loans we originate in order to reduce our credit risk and
provide funding for additional loans. We rely on GSEs to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on other capital markets investors to purchase loans that do not meet those requirements   referred to as
 nonconforming  loans. During the past few years investor demand for nonconforming loans has fallen sharply, increasing credit spreads and reducing the liquidity for those loans. In response to the reduced liquidity in the capital markets,
we may retain more nonconforming loans. When we retain a loan not only do we keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could be used to generate new loans. Continued lack of liquidity could limit our ability
to fund   and thus originate   new mortgage loans, reducing the fees we earn from originating and servicing loans. In addition, we cannot assure that GSEs will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans, including because of
capital constraints or change their criteria for conforming loans (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). Each of the GSEs is currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Agency acting as conservator. We
cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorship will end, or any associated changes to the GSEs business structure and operations that could result. As noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S.,
including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The extent and timing of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs, including whether the GSEs will continue to exist in their current form, as well as
any effect on the Company s business and financial results, are uncertain.      For more information, refer to the
 Risk Management   Asset/Liability Management   Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk  and  Critical Accounting Policies  sections in this Report.       We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties.  We sell residential mortgage loans to
various parties, including GSEs, SPEs that issue private label MBS, and other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. We may also pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans which
back securities guaranteed by GNMA. The agreements under which we sell mortgage loans and the insurance or guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the
mortgage loans, including ownership of the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, validity of the lien securing the loan, absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, and compliance
with applicable origination laws. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event
of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a

period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. Contracts for mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be
applied to inadequate responses to repurchase requests. Similarly, the agreements under which we sell mortgage loans require us to deliver various documents to the securitization trust or investor, and we may be obligated to repurchase any mortgage
loan as to which the required documents are not delivered or are defective. We may negotiate global settlements in order to resolve a pipeline of demands in lieu of repurchasing the loans. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability related to the
various representations and warranties that reflect management s estimate of losses for loans which we have a repurchase obligation. Our mortgage purchase liability represents management s best estimate of the probable loss that we may
expect to incur for the representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage loans. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external
conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgment. As a result of the uncertainty in the various
estimates underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is a range of losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability that are reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss for representations and warranties
does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. If economic conditions and the housing market do not improve or future investor
repurchase demand and our success at appealing repurchase requests differ from past experience, we could continue to have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring material additions to the repurchase
liability.      For more information, refer to the  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management   Liability for
Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses  section in this Report.       We may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to
repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan
foreclosure actions.  We act as servicer and/or master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a servicer or master servicer for those loans we have certain contractual
obligations to the securitization trusts, investors or other third parties, including, in our capacity as a servicer, foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor
agreement, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales and, in our capacity as a master servicer, overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as

105   

Risk Factors    (continued)     
  servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which can
generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders, causing us to lose servicing income. In addition, we may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us, as a
servicer or master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations or any act or omission on our part that involves wilful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence. For certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually
obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy
our obligations as a servicer or master servicer, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to net servicing income within mortgage banking noninterest income.   
  We may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a
servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the
foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us,
particularly to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. We may incur
liability to securitization investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of our MSRs may be negatively affected to
the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure costs. We may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by Federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices or in the
foreclosure practices of other mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or servicing business. In April 2011, we entered into consent orders with the OCC and the
FRB following a joint interagency horizontal examination of foreclosure processing at large mortgage servicers, including the Company. These orders incorporate remedial requirements for identified deficiencies and require the Company to, among other
things, take certain actions with respect to our mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations, including submitting various action plans to ensure that our mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations comply with legal requirements, regulatory
guidance and the consent orders. As noted above, any increase in our servicing costs from changes in our foreclosure and other servicing practices, including resulting from the consent orders, negatively affects the fair value of our MSRs.

The consent orders did not provide for civil money
penalties but both government entities reserved the ability to seek such penalties. On February 9, 2012, the OCC and the FRB announced that they had also imposed civil money penalties of $83 million and $85 million, respectively, related to the
consent orders. These penalties will be satisfied through payments made under a separate simultaneous settlement in principle, announced on the same day, among the Department of Justice, a task force of Attorneys General from 49 states, other
government entities, the Company and four other mortgage servicers related to mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices. Under the settlement in principle, which is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and court approval, the
Company agreed to certain commitments totaling $5.3 billion involving, among other things, a commitment to provide $3.4 billion in aggregate consumer relief and assistance programs for qualified borrowers, including expanded first and second lien
mortgage modifications that broaden the use of principal reduction to help customers achieve affordability, an expanded short sale program that includes waivers of deficiency balances, forgiveness of arrearages for unemployed borrowers,
cash-for-keys payments to borrowers who voluntarily vacate properties, and  anti-blight  provisions designed to reduce the impact on communities of vacant properties, and an expanded first-lien refinance program commitment estimated to
provide $900 million of aggregate payment relief to qualified borrowers over the life of the refinanced loans. In addition, the Company will be required to implement comprehensive servicing standards. As part of the settlement in principle, the
Company was released from claims and allegations relating to servicing, modification and foreclosure practices; however, the settlement does not release the Company from any claims arising out of securitization activities, including representations
made to investors respecting mortgage-backed securities; criminal claims; repurchase demands from the GSEs; and inquiries into MERS, among other items. Government agencies continue investigations of whether the Company may have violated fair lending
or other laws and regulations relating to mortgage origination practices and whether the Company s offering statements included adequate disclosure of the risks associated with mortgage-backed securities. These investigations, as well as any
investigations or litigation relating to any of the Company s mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices that are not covered or released by the settlement in principle or definitive agreement, could result in material fines, penalties,
equitable remedies, or other enforcement actions. The Company s payment and other customer relief obligations under the settlement in principle were accrued for or otherwise considered in our allowance for credit losses and in the nonaccretable
difference relating to our purchased-credit-impaired residential mortgage portfolio as of December 31, 2011, and, therefore, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial results. However, there can be no assurance that the
settlement will not result in unexpected costs or developments that could materially adversely affect our mortgage business and/or our financial results. For example, we may be required to pay additional amounts under the settlement if we fail to
satisfy our commitment requirements in a timely manner. Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to when or whether a definitive agreement regarding the settlement will be reached and finalized or that it will be on terms consistent with the
settlement in principle.      For more information, refer to the  Risk Management   Liability for Mortgage Loan
Repurchase Losses  and    Risks Relating to Servicing Activities,  and  Critical Accounting Policies   Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights  sections and Note 14 (Guarantees) and Note 15 (Legal
Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.   

Financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may negatively affect our
servicing and investment portfolios.  Our servicing portfolio includes certain mortgage loans that carry some level of insurance from one or more mortgage insurance companies. To the extent that any of these companies experience financial
difficulties or credit downgrades, we may be required, as servicer of the insured loan on behalf of the investor, to obtain replacement coverage with another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we would replace. We may be
responsible for some or all of the incremental cost of the new coverage for certain loans depending on the terms of our servicing agreement with the investor and other circumstances, although we do not have an additional risk of repurchase loss
associated with claim amounts for loans sold to third-party investors. Similarly, some of the mortgage loans we hold for investment or for sale carry mortgage insurance. If a mortgage insurer is unable to meet its credit obligations with respect to
an insured loan, we might incur higher credit losses if replacement coverage is not obtained. For example, in October 2011, PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. (PMI), one of our providers of mortgage insurance, was seized by its regulator. We previously
utilized PMI to provide mortgage insurance on certain loans originated and held in our portfolio and on loans originated and sold to third-party investors. We also hold a small amount of residential MBS, which are backed by mortgages with a limited
amount of insurance provided by PMI. PMI has announced that it will pay 50% of insurance claim amounts in cash with the rest deferred. Although we do not expect PMI s situation to have a material adverse effect on our financial results because
of the limited amount of loans and securities held in our portfolios with PMI insurance support, we cannot be certain that any such future events involving one of our other mortgage insurance company providers will not materially adversely affect
our mortgage business and/or financial results. We also have investments in municipal bonds that are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. The value of these bonds and the payment of principal and interest on them may be negatively affected by
financial difficulties or credit downgrades experienced by the bond insurers.      For more information, refer to the
 Earnings Performance   Balance Sheet Analysis   Securities Available for Sale  and  Risk Management   Credit Risk Management  Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses  sections in this Report.
      OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK    
   A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers,
including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  As a large financial institution
that serves over 70 million customers through over 9,000 stores, 12,000 ATMs, the Internet and other distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer
transactions on a

continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, and as customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and
information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other
operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in customer
transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and,
as described below, cyber attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating
systems that support our businesses and customers.      Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells
Fargo have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities
of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Those parties also may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to
our data or that of our customers. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital
markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PC s, and
other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers  devices may become the target of cyber attacks or
information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo s or our customers  confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt Wells
Fargo s or its customers  or other third parties  business operations.      Third parties with which we do
business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information
security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.      Although to date we
have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because
of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and

107   

Risk Factors    (continued)     

its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our Internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to
serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, the continued uncertain global economic environment, and the remaining system
and customer account conversions associated with our integration of Wachovia expected to be completed in first quarter 2012. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed
to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to
continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.      Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our
customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, financial losses, the inability of our customers to transact business with us, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties or
intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.   
   Our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and
loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk,
legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not
appropriately anticipated or identified. For example, the recent financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks. If our risk management
framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.       We may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.  We maintain systems and procedures designed to
ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though
there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of

Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated
nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of
noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation as described below and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.   
   Negative publicity, including as a result of protests, could damage our reputation and business.  Reputation risk, or the risk to our business,
earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and increased substantially because of the financial crisis and the increase in our size and profile in the financial services industry following our acquisition of
Wachovia. The reputation of the financial services industry in general has been damaged as a result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the financial services industry, and negative public opinion about the financial services
industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including mortgage lending
practices, servicing and foreclosure activities, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and
community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Because we conduct most of our businesses under the  Wells Fargo  brand, negative public opinion about one business could affect our other businesses and also could negatively
affect our  cross-sell  strategy. The proliferation of social media websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our team members and others, including personal blogs and social
network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our team members
interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets.      During the past several months,
Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been the targets of numerous protests throughout the U.S., such as the  Occupy Wall Street  protests and other movements designed to cause customers to close their accounts with large
financial institutions. These protests have included disrupting the operation of our retail banking stores and have resulted in negative public commentary about financial institutions, including the fees charged for various products and services.
There can be no assurance that continued protests and negative publicity for the Company or large financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and financial results.

108   

Risks Relating to Legal Proceedings.  Wells Fargo and some of its subsidiaries are involved in
judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from our business activities. Although we believe we have a meritorious defense in all material significant litigation pending against us, there can be no
assurance as to the ultimate outcome. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not
established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted,
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.      For more information, refer to Note 15
(Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.       RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY S COMPETITIVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
       We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.  We compete with other financial
institutions in a highly competitive industry that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from the recent financial crisis and continued challenging economic conditions.
Wells Fargo generally competes on the basis of the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers  needs, the
pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued and increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our market share
and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. Given the current economic, regulatory, and political environment for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, as
well as increased public protest movements and negative publicity, there is increased competitive pressure to provide products and services at current or lower prices. Consequently, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from
time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the actions of our competitors who may or may not charge similar fees for their products and services. Any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers
and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customers and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.      Continued technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for
financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic payment solutions. We may not respond effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be
forced to increase our investment in our

business to modify or adapt our existing products and services or develop new products and services to respond to our customers  needs.   
   Our  cross-selling  efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that
fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy, and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results.  Selling more products to our customers  
 cross-selling    is very important to our business model and key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings especially during the current environment of slow economic growth and regulatory reform initiatives. Many of our competitors
also focus on cross-selling, especially in retail banking and mortgage lending. This can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices, reducing our net interest income and revenue from
our fee-based products. It could also affect our ability to keep existing customers. New technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers. Our cross-sell strategy also is dependent on
earning more business from our Wachovia customers, and increasing our cross-sell ratio   or the average number of products sold to existing customers   may become more challenging and we might not attain our goal of selling an average of
eight products to each customer.          Our ability to attract and retain qualified team members is critical to the success of our
business and failure to do so could adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our team members, and in many areas of our
business, including the commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets businesses, the competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. In order to attract and retain highly qualified team members, we must provide
competitive compensation. As a large financial institution we may be subject to limitations on compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain these qualified team members. Some of our competitors may not
be subject to these same compensation limitations, which may further negatively affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified team members.       RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        Changes in accounting policies or accounting
standards, and changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.  Our accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial
results and condition. As described below, some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies could materially affect
our financial statements.   

109   

Risk Factors    (continued)       

From time to time the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting
standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change or
even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and
could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, also retroactively, in each case resulting in our potentially
restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.       Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates
which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future, and our financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting.  Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our
financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves for mortgage repurchases, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Several of our accounting policies are
critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using
different assumptions. For a description of these policies, refer to the  Critical Accounting Policies  section in this Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material
losses.      Certain of our financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities,
certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices
are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable
price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value
certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings.   
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires our management to evaluate the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any
 material weaknesses  in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we

will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. Sarbanes-Oxley
also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be  independent  of us under SEC rules, we could be required to engage
new auditors and file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse
consequences.       RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS        Acquisitions could reduce our stock price upon announcement and reduce our earnings if we overpay or have difficulty integrating them.  We regularly explore opportunities to acquire companies in the
financial services industry. We cannot predict the frequency, size or timing of our acquisitions, and we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition until we have signed a definitive agreement. When we do announce an acquisition, our
stock price may fall depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue common stock in connection with the
acquisition.      We generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we can acquire a bank, bank holding company or
certain other financial services businesses depending on the size of the financial services business to be acquired. In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the
acquisition on competition and the risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, our financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of
management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including our record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and our effectiveness in combating money laundering.
As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and concerns regarding the large size of financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, the regulatory process for approving acquisitions has become more complex and regulatory approvals may be more difficult to
obtain. We cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a condition to
receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. In addition, federal bank regulations prohibit FRB regulatory approval of any transaction that would create an institution holding more than 10% of total U.S. insured deposits, or of any transaction
(whether or not subject to FRB approval) that would create a financial company with more than 10% of the liabilities of all financial companies in the U.S. We are approaching the deposit cap, which may limit our bank acquisition opportunities in the
future.   

110   

Difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause us not to realize expected
revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key team members, disruption of our
business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and team members or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on integration may also impair our ability to grow
our existing businesses. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the acquired company
operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations and/or team members.      * * *      Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC filings
could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2012 for material changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are
factors not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could adversely affect our financial results and condition.

111   

Controls and Procedures    
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
      As required by SEC rules, the Company s
management evaluated the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2011, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this
evaluation, the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011.   
     Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
      Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that:   

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the
Company;      

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and      

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.         Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during any quarter in 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth below, and should be read with these limitations in mind.         Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting       The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control   Integrated
Framework . Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.      KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s financial statements included in this Annual Report, issued an audit report on the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. KPMG s audit report appears on the following page.   
         112   

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
      The Board of Directors and Stockholders
     Wells Fargo   Company:   
  We have audited Wells Fargo   Company and Subsidiaries  (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2011, based on criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.      We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011,
based on criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by COSO.      We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 28, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Policies        

Wells Fargo   Company is a diversified financial services company. We provide banking,
insurance, trust and investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, brokerage, and consumer and commercial finance through banking stores, the internet and other distribution channels to consumers, businesses and institutions in
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in other countries. When we refer to  Wells Fargo,   the Company,   we,   our  or  us,  we mean Wells Fargo   Company and Subsidiaries
(consolidated). Wells Fargo   Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding.
     Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the
financial services industry. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate
prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions
and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made
significant estimates in several areas, including allowance for credit losses and purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans (Note 6), valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Notes 8 and 9) and financial instruments (Note 17),
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses (Note 9) and income taxes (Note 21). Actual results could differ from those estimates.   
   Accounting Standards Adopted in 2011       In
first quarter 2011, we adopted certain provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2010-6,  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements .       ASU 2010-06  amends the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Companies are required to disclose significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. This
Update also clarifies that fair value measurement disclosures should be presented for each asset and liability class, which is generally a subset of a line item in the statement of financial position. In the rollforward of Level 3 activity,
companies must present information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis rather than on a net basis. Companies should also provide information about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both
recurring and nonrecurring instruments classified as either Level 2 or Level 3. In first quarter 2011, we adopted the

requirement for gross presentation in the Level 3 rollforward with prospective application. The remaining provisions were effective for us in first quarter 2010. Our adoption of this Update did
not affect our consolidated financial statement results since it amends only the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.      In third quarter 2011, we adopted the following new accounting guidance:   

Certain provisions of ASU 2010-20,  Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses ; and

ASU 2011-02,  A Creditor s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring.        
   ASU 2010-20  requires enhanced disclosures for the allowance for credit losses and financing receivables, which include certain loans and long-term
accounts receivables. Companies are required to disaggregate credit quality information and roll forward the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment. Companies must also provide supplemental information on the nature and extent of troubled
debt restructurings (TDRs) and their effect on the allowance for credit losses. We adopted the new disclosure requirements for TDRs in third quarter 2011 with retrospective application to January 1, 2011. The remaining provisions were effective
for us in fourth quarter 2010. Our adoption of this Update did not affect our consolidated financial statement results since it amends only the disclosure requirements for financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses.   
   ASU 2011-02  provides guidance clarifying under what circumstances a creditor should classify a restructured receivable as a TDR. A receivable is a
TDR if both of the following exist: 1) a creditor has granted a concession to the debtor, and 2) the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. This Update clarifies that a creditor should consider all aspects of a restructuring when evaluating
whether it has granted a concession, which include determining whether a debtor can obtain funds from another source at market rates and assessing the value of additional collateral and guarantees obtained at the time of restructuring. This Update
also provides factors a creditor should consider when determining if a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, such as probability of payment default and bankruptcy declarations. This guidance was effective for us in third quarter 2011 with
retrospective application to January 1, 2011. Our adoption of this Update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.      In fourth quarter 2011, we early adopted ASU 2011-08,  Testing Goodwill for Impairment .

121   

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (continued)    

ASU 2011-08  provides entities with the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to
test for impairment. If, based on qualitative reviews, a company concludes that more likely than not a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the company must complete quantitative steps to determine if there is
goodwill impairment. If a company concludes otherwise, quantitative tests are not required. Our adoption of this Update did not affect our consolidated financial statements.       Accounting Standards with Retrospective Application       The following accounting
pronouncements have been issued by the FASB but are not yet effective:       

Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2011-11,  Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities;       

ASU 2011-12,  Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.           ASU 2011-11  expands the disclosure requirements for
financial instruments and derivatives that may be offset in accordance with enforceable master netting agreements or similar arrangements. The disclosures are required regardless of whether the instruments have been offset (or netted) in the
statement of financial position. Under ASU 2011-11, companies must describe the nature of offsetting arrangements and provide quantitative information about those agreements, including the gross and net amounts of financial instruments that are
recognized in the statement of financial position. These changes are effective for us in first quarter 2013 with retrospective application. This Update will not affect our consolidated financial results since it amends only the disclosure
requirements for offsetting financial instruments.       ASU 2011-05  eliminates the option for companies to include the components of other
comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders  equity. This Update requires entities to present the components of comprehensive income in either a single statement or in two separate statements, with the statement of other
comprehensive income (OCI) immediately following the statement of income. This Update also requires companies to present amounts reclassified out of OCI and into net income on the face of the statement of income. In December 2011, the FASB issued
 ASU 2011-12 , which defers indefinitely the requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the statement of income. The remaining provisions are effective for us in first quarter 2012 with retrospective application. Early adoption is
permitted. This Update will not affect our consolidated financial results as it amends only the presentation of comprehensive income.   
   Consolidation       Our consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Parent and our majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs (defined below) in which we are the primary beneficiary.

Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If we own at least 20% of an entity, we generally account for the investment using the equity method. If we own
less than 20% of an entity, we generally carry the investment at cost, except marketable equity securities, which we carry at fair value with changes in fair value included in OCI. Investments accounted for under the equity or cost method are
included in other assets.      We are a variable interest holder in certain special-purpose entities (SPEs) in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or where the entity does not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties (referred to as
VIEs). Our variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair value of the entity s assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary, defined
as the party that that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. A variable interest is a contractual, ownership or other interest
that changes with changes in the fair value of the VIE s net assets. To determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the
nature, size and form of our involvement with the VIE. We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an on-going basis.   
   Cash and Due From Banks       Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in transit, and amounts due from the Federal Reserve Bank and other depository institutions.   
   Trading Assets       Trading assets are
primarily securities, including corporate debt, U.S. government agency obligations and other securities that we acquire for short-term appreciation or other trading purposes, and the fair value of derivatives held for customer accommodation purposes
or risk mitigation and hedging. Interest-only strips and other retained interests in securitizations that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment are
classified as trading assets. Trading assets are carried at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income.       Securities        S ECURITIES   AVAILABLE   FOR 
 SALE     Debt securities that we might not hold until maturity and marketable equity securities are classified as securities available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, after applicable
taxes, are reported in cumulative OCI. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices in active markets, if available. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other
model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions and market liquidity. See Note 17 for more
information on fair value measurement of our securities.   

122   

We conduct OTTI analysis on a quarterly basis or more often if a potential
loss-triggering event occurs. The initial indicator of OTTI for both debt and equity securities is a decline in market value below the amount recorded for an investment and the severity and duration of the decline.   
  For a debt security for which there has been a decline in the fair value below amortized cost basis, we recognize OTTI if we
(1) have the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of
the security.      Estimating recovery of the amortized cost basis of a debt security is based upon an assessment of the cash
flows expected to be collected. If the cash flows expected to be collected are less than amortized cost, OTTI is considered to have occurred. In performing an assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all relevant
information including:   

the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;      

the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security;      

the cause of the price decline, such as the general level of interest rates or adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or
a geographic area;      

the issuer s financial condition, near-term prospects and ability to service the debt;      

the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;

for asset-backed securities, the credit performance of the underlying collateral, including delinquency rates, level of non-performing assets,
cumulative losses to date, collateral value and the remaining credit enhancement compared with expected credit losses;      

any change in rating agencies  credit ratings at evaluation date from acquisition date and any likely imminent action;

independent analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings and other independent market data; and      

recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.      
  If we intend to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI
write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the amortized cost basis and fair value of the security. For debt securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired that we do not intend to sell or it is more
likely than not that we will not be required to sell before recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in
OCI. The measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference between the debt security s cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the security s effective yield. The remaining
difference between the security s fair value and the present value of future expected cash

flows is due to factors that are not credit-related and, therefore, are recognized in OCI. We believe that we will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which we have recorded a
non-credit-related impairment in OCI.      We hold investments in perpetual preferred securities (PPS) that are structured in
equity form, but have many of the characteristics of debt instruments, including periodic cash flows in the form of dividends, call features, ratings that are similar to debt securities and pricing like long-term callable bonds.   
  Because of the hybrid nature of these securities, we evaluate PPS for OTTI using a model similar to the model we use for debt securities
as described above. Among the factors we consider in our evaluation of PPS are whether there is any evidence of deterioration in the credit of the issuer as indicated by a decline in cash flows or a rating agency downgrade to below investment grade
and the estimated recovery period. Additionally, in determining if there was evidence of credit deterioration, we evaluate: (1) the severity of decline in market value below cost, (2) the period of time for which the decline in fair value
has existed, and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer. We consider PPS to be other-than-temporarily impaired if cash flows expected to
be collected are insufficient to recover our investment or if we no longer believe the security will recover within the estimated recovery period. OTTI write-downs of PPS are recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the cost basis and
fair value of the security. Based upon the factors considered in our OTTI evaluation, we believe our investments in PPS currently rated investment grade will be fully realized and, accordingly, have not recognized OTTI on such securities.
     For marketable equity securities other than PPS, OTTI evaluations focus on whether evidence exists that supports recovery of
the unrealized loss within a timeframe consistent with temporary impairment. This evaluation considers the severity of and length of time fair value is below cost, our intent and ability to hold the security until forecasted recovery of the fair
value of the security, and the investee s financial condition, capital strength, and near-term prospects.      The
securities portfolio is an integral part of our asset/liability management process. We manage these investments to provide liquidity, manage interest rate risk and maximize portfolio yield within capital risk limits approved by management and the
Board of Directors and monitored by the Corporate Asset/Liability Management Committee (Corporate ALCO). We recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities in noninterest income using the specific identification method.
     Unamortized premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the
interest method. As principal repayments are received on securities (i.e., primarily mortgage-backed securities (MBS)) a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the
remaining portion of the security continues unchanged.   

123   

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      (continued)       

NONMARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES  Nonmarketable equity securities include venture capital equity
securities that are not publicly traded and securities acquired for various purposes, such as to meet regulatory requirements (for example, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock). These securities are accounted for under the
cost or equity method and are included in other assets. We review those assets accounted for under the cost or equity method at least quarterly for possible OTTI. Our review typically includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each
investment, the expectations for the investment s cash flows and capital needs, the viability of its business model and our exit strategy. We reduce the asset value when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary. We recognize the
estimated loss as a loss from equity investments in noninterest income. In addition, we invest in certain equity securities held by our subsidiaries that meet the definition of an investment company (principal investments) and, therefore, are
recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in gains and losses from equity investments in noninterest income.       Securities Purchased and Sold Agreements       Securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. It is our policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale
agreements, which are primarily U.S. Government and Government agency securities. We monitor the market value of securities purchased and sold, and obtain collateral from or return it to counterparties when appropriate. These financing transactions
do not create material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring process.       Mortgages Held for Sale
      Mortgages held for sale (MHFS) include commercial and residential mortgages originated for sale and securitization in the secondary
market, which is our principal market, or for sale as whole loans. We elect the fair value option for substantially all residential MHFS (see Note 17). The remaining residential MHFS are held at the lower of cost or market value (LOCOM), and are
valued on an aggregate portfolio basis. Commercial MHFS are held at LOCOM and are valued on an individual loan basis.      Gains
and losses on MHFS are recorded in mortgage banking noninterest income. Direct loan origination costs and fees for MHFS under fair value option are recognized in mortgage banking noninterest income at origination. For MHFS recorded at LOCOM, loan
costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in mortgage banking noninterest income at time of sale. Interest income on MHFS for which the fair value option is elected is calculated based upon the note rate of the loan and is
recorded to interest income.      Our lines of business are authorized to originate held-for-investment loans that meet or exceed
established loan product profitability criteria, including minimum positive net interest margin spreads in excess of funding costs. When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to
hold these loans to maturity or for the  foreseeable future,  subject to periodic

review under our corporate asset/liability management process. In determining the  foreseeable future  for these loans, management considers (1) the current economic environment
and market conditions, (2) our business strategy and current business plans, (3) the nature and type of the loan receivable, including its expected life, and (4) our current financial condition and liquidity demands. Consistent with
our core banking business of managing the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our funds, loans are periodically reevaluated to determine if our minimum net interest margin spreads continue to meet our profitability objectives. If
subsequent changes in interest rates significantly impact the ongoing profitability of certain loan products, we may subsequently change our intent to hold these loans, and we would take actions to sell such loans in response to the Corporate ALCO
directives to reposition our balance sheet because of the changes in interest rates. These directives identify both the type of loans to be sold and the weighted average coupon rate of such loans no longer meeting our ongoing investment criteria.
Upon the issuance of such directives, we immediately transfer these loans to the MHFS portfolio at LOCOM.       Loans Held for Sale
      Loans held for sale (LHFS) are carried at LOCOM or at fair value. Generally, consumer loans are valued on an aggregate portfolio basis,
and commercial loans are valued on an individual loan basis. Gains and losses on LHFS are recorded in other noninterest income. For LHFS recorded at LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination and are recognized in
other noninterest income at time of sale. For loans recorded at fair value, direct loan origination costs and fees are recorded in other noninterest income at origination. The fair value of LHFS is based on what secondary markets are currently
offering for portfolios with similar characteristics, and related gains and losses are recorded in noninterest income.       Loans
      Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees
and costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. PCI loans are reported net of any remaining purchase accounting adjustments. See the  Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans  section in this Note for our
accounting policy for PCI loans.      Unearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts and premiums are amortized to
interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the interest method. Loan commitment fees are generally deferred and amortized into noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.   
  Loans also include direct financing leases that are recorded at the aggregate of minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated
residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of direct financing leases, are recorded net of related nonrecourse debt. Leasing income is recognized as a constant percentage of outstanding lease
financing balances over the lease terms in interest income.   

124   

NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS  We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when:   

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain;      

they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest or principal, unless both
well-secured and in the process of collection; or      

part of the principal balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred.      
  PCI loans are written down at acquisition to fair value using an estimate of cash flows deemed to be collectible. Accordingly, such
loans are no longer classified as nonaccrual even though they may be contractually past due because we expect to fully collect the new carrying values of such loans (that is, the new cost basis arising out of purchase accounting).   
  When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and amortization of
any net deferred fees is suspended. A loan will remain in accruing status provided it is both well-secured and in the process of collection. If the ultimate collectability of a loan is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual, the cost recovery method
is used and cash collected is applied to first reduce the principal outstanding. Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the terms of the loan agreement and collectability of
remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful.      For modified loans, we underwrite at the time of a restructuring to
determine if there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower s financial strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the
previous terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will remain in accruing status. When a loan classified as a TDR performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan
either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive
payments made prior to the modification). Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and a corresponding charge-off is recorded if we believe it is probable that principal and interest contractually due under the modified terms of the agreement will
not be collectible.      Generally, consumer loans not secured by real estate or autos are placed on nonaccrual status only when
part of the principal has been charged off. Loans are fully charged off or charged down to net realizable value (fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell) when deemed uncollectible due to bankruptcy or other factors, or when they reach
a defined number of days past due based on loan product, industry practice, country, terms and other factors.      Our loans are considered past
due when contractually required principal or interest payments have not been made on the due dates.

LOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES  For commercial loans, we generally fully charge off or charge down to net
realizable value for loans secured by collateral when:      

management judges the loan to be uncollectible;      

repayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable time frames;      

the loan has been classified as a loss by either our internal loan review process or our banking regulatory agencies;      

the customer has filed bankruptcy and the loss becomes evident owing to a lack of assets; or      

the loan is 180 days past due unless both well-secured and in the process of collection.      
  For consumer loans, our charge-off policies are as follows:   

1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages   We generally charge down to net realizable value when the loan is 180 days past due.

Auto loans   We generally fully charge off when the loan is 120 days past due.      

Credit card loans   We generally fully charge off when the loan is 180 days past due.      

Unsecured loans (closed end)   We generally charge off when the loan is 120 days past due.      

Unsecured loans (open end)   We generally charge off when the loan is 180 days past due.      

Other secured loans   We generally fully or partially charge down to net realizable value when the loan is 120 days past due.
         IMPAIRED LOANS  We consider a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, we determine that we
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. This evaluation is generally based on delinquency information, an assessment of the borrower s financial condition and the
adequacy of collateral, if any. Our impaired loans predominantly include loans on nonaccrual status for commercial and industrial, commercial real estate (CRE), foreign loans and any loans modified in a TDR, on both accrual and nonaccrual status.
     When we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows,
discounted at the loan s effective interest rate. When collateral is the sole source of repayment for the loan, we may measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. If foreclosure is probable, we use the current fair value of
the collateral less estimated selling costs, instead of discounted cash flows.      If we determine that the value of an impaired
loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), we recognize impairment. When the value of an impaired loan is calculated by discounting expected
cash flows, interest income is recognized using the loan s effective interest rate over the remaining life of the loan.       TROUBLED DEBT
RESTRUCTURINGS (TDR  s)  In situations where, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that we would not otherwise

125   

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    (continued)         

consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. We strive to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify their loan to more affordable terms before it reaches
nonaccrual status. These modified terms may include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. For
modifications where we forgive principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. Loans classified as TDRs, including loans in trial payment periods (trial modifications), are considered impaired loans.
      PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS  Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where it is
probable that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are accounted for using the measurement provision for PCI loans. PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the historical
allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over. Some loans that otherwise meet the definition as credit-impaired are specifically excluded from the PCI loan portfolios, such as revolving loans where the borrower still has
revolving privileges.      Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past
due and nonaccrual status, commercial risk ratings, recent borrower credit scores and recent loan-to-value percentages. Generally, acquired loans that meet our definition for nonaccrual status are considered to be credit-impaired.   
  Substantially all commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and
other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.   
  Accounting for PCI loans involves estimating fair value, at acquisition, using the principal and interest cash flows expected to be
collected discounted at the prevailing market rate of interest. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value (estimated fair value at acquisition date) is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest
income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected. The difference between contractually
required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable difference.      Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. If we have probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected (other than due to decreases in
interest rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions), we charge the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If we have probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected,
we first reverse any previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest

income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans. Estimates of cash flows are impacted by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans
and prepayment assumptions, both of which are treated as prospective yield adjustments included in interest income.   
  Resolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or foreclosure of
the collateral. For individual PCI loans, gains or losses on sales to third parties are included in noninterest income, and gains or losses as a result of a settlement with the borrower are included in interest income. Our policy is to remove an
individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the nonaccretable difference for the entire pool. This removal method assumes
that the amount received from resolution approximates pool performance expectations. The remaining accretable yield balance is unaffected and any material change in remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is addressed by our
quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the
contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed TDRs. Modified PCI loans that are accounted for individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting if there
has been a concession granted in excess of the original nonaccretable difference. We include these TDRs in our impaired loans.       FORECLOSED
ASSETS  Foreclosed assets obtained through our lending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans have been written down to their net realizable value prior to foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is
recorded with a charge to the allowance for credit losses at foreclosure. We allow up to 90 days after foreclosure to finalize determination of net realizable value. Thereafter, changes in net realizable value are recorded to noninterest expense.
The net realizable value of these assets is reviewed and updated periodically depending on the type of property.       ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT
LOSSES  The allowance for credit losses (allowance), which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded
credit commitments at the balance sheet date, excluding loans carried at fair value. It considers both unimpaired and impaired loans and is developed and documented at the loan portfolio segment level   commercial and consumer.   
  Unimpaired loans are generally evaluated on a collective basis by utilizing risk grades for the commercial loan portfolio segment and
loss estimates for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics for the consumer loan portfolio segment. Impaired loans are evaluated on an individual loan basis and predominantly include loans on nonaccrual status for commercial and industrial,
commercial real estate, foreign loans   

126   

and any loans modified in a TDR, on both accrual and nonaccrual status. Commercial and consumer PCI loans may require an allowance subsequent to their acquisition due to probable decreases in
expected principal and interest cash flows (other than due to decreases in interest rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions).      The allowance for each portfolio segment includes an amount for imprecision or uncertainty that may change from period to period. This imprecision amount represents management s judgment of risks
inherent in the evaluation processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance. While our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to the specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses
inherent in the total loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. No single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.       Securitizations and Beneficial Interests       In certain asset securitization transactions that
meet the applicable criteria to be accounted for as a sale, assets are sold to an entity referred to as an SPE, which then issues beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated interests collateralized by the assets. In some cases, we
may retain beneficial interests issued by the entity. Additionally, from time to time, we may also re-securitize certain assets in a new securitization transaction.      The assets and liabilities transferred to an SPE are excluded from our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies as a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE.   
  For transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained (including
beneficial interests) and liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest income for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets sold. Fair values are based on quoted market prices, quoted market prices
for similar assets, or if market prices are not available, then the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with assumptions for credit losses, prepayments and discount rates that are corroborated by and independently verified
against market observable data, where possible. Retained interests from securitizations with off-balance sheet entities, including SPEs and VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary, are classified as available for sale securities, trading
account assets or loans, and are accounted for as described herein.       Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)    
  We recognize the rights to service mortgage loans for others, or MSRs, as assets whether we purchase the MSRs or the MSRs result from a sale or
securitization of loans we originate (asset transfers). We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at either fair value or LOCOM based on our strategy for managing interest rate risk.
Currently, substantially all of our residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. All of our MSRs related to our commercial mortgage loans are subsequently measured at LOCOM.

We base the fair value of MSRs on the present value of estimated future net servicing
income cash flows. We estimate future net servicing income cash flows with assumptions that market participants would use to estimate fair value, including estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility), discount rates, default
rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. Our valuation approach is independently validated by our internal valuation model
validation group and our valuation estimates are periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals.      Changes in the fair
value of MSRs occur primarily due to the collection/realization of expected cash flows, as well as changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. For MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are reported in noninterest income in the period in
which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at LOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is reported in noninterest income, analyzed monthly and adjusted to reflect
changes in prepayment speeds, as well as other factors.      MSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated for
impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we stratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by individual
stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds fair value, a valuation reserve is established. The valuation reserve is adjusted as the fair value changes.       Premises and Equipment       Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Capital leases, where we are the lessee, are included in premises and equipment at the capitalized amount less accumulated amortization.      We primarily use the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the
estimated useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements. We amortize capitalized leased assets on a straight-line basis over the lives of the respective leases.       Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets       Goodwill is recorded in business combinations
under the purchase method of accounting when the purchase price is higher than the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets.      We assess goodwill for impairment annually, and more frequently in certain circumstances. We initially perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment. If, based on our qualitative
review, we conclude that more likely than not a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we complete quantitative steps as described below to determine if there is goodwill impairment. If we conclude that a reporting
unit fair value is not less than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. We have determined that our reporting units are one level below the operating segments. We assess goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level and

127   

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      (continued)       

apply various quantitative valuation methodologies when required to compare the estimated fair value to the
carrying value of each reporting unit. Valuation methodologies include discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an additional test is required to measure the amount of impairment. We
recognize impairment losses as a charge to noninterest expense (unless related to discontinued operations) and an adjustment to the carrying value of the goodwill asset. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited.   
  We amortize core deposit and other customer relationship intangibles on an accelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years.
We review such intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the
carrying value of the asset. Impairment is permanently recognized by writing down the asset to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.       Operating Lease Assets       Operating lease rental income for leased assets is recognized in
other income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Related depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, considering the estimated residual value of the leased asset. The useful life may be
adjusted to the term of the lease depending on our plans for the asset after the lease term. On a periodic basis, leased assets are reviewed for impairment. Impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of leased assets exceeds fair value and
is not recoverable. The carrying amount of leased assets is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon the eventual disposition of the
equipment.       Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses       We sell residential mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (government-sponsored entities (GSEs)), which include the mortgage loans in GSE-guaranteed mortgage
securitizations, (2) special purpose entities that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In addition, we pool Federal Housing
Administration (FHA)-insured and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans, which back securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).   
  We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans (collectively  repurchase ) in the event of a breach of specified contractual representations or warranties that are not remedied within a period (usually 90
days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. Our loan sale contracts to private investors (non-GSE) typically contain an additional provision where we would only be required to repurchase securitized loans if a breach is deemed to have a
material and

adverse effect on the value of the mortgage loan or to the investors or interests of security holders in the mortgage loan.   
  We establish mortgage repurchase liabilities related to various representations and warranties that reflect management s estimate
of losses for loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Such factors include default expectations, expected investor repurchase demands (influenced by
current and expected mortgage loan file requests and mortgage insurance rescissions notices, as well as estimated demand to default and file request relationships) and appeals success rates (where the investor rescinds the demand based on a cure of
the defect or acknowledges that the loan satisfies the investor s applicable representations and warranties), reimbursement by correspondent and other third party originators, and projected loss severity. We establish a liability at the time
loans are sold and continually update our liability estimate during their life. Although investors may demand repurchase at any time and there is often a lag from the date of default to the time we receive a repurchase demand, the majority of
repurchase demands occur on loans that default in the first 24 to 36 months following origination of the mortgage loan and can vary by investor.      The liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is included in other liabilities. For additional information on our repurchase liability, see Note 9.   
   Pension Accounting       We account for our
defined benefit pension plans using an actuarial model as more fully discussed in Note 20.      Income Taxes    
  We file consolidated and separate company federal income tax returns, foreign tax returns and various combined and separate company state tax returns.
     We evaluate two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be
paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions. We determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on
the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax
assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is  more likely than not.  Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold
are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Foreign taxes
paid are generally applied as credits to reduce federal income taxes payable. We account for interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.

128   

Stock-Based Compensation       We have stock-based employee compensation plans as more fully discussed in Note 19. Our compensation expense includes the associated costs for all share-based awards.   
   Earnings Per Common Share       We compute
earnings per common share by dividing net income (after deducting dividends and related accretion on preferred stock) by the average number of common shares outstanding during the year. We compute diluted earnings per common share by dividing net
income (after deducting dividends and related accretion on preferred stock) by the average number of common shares outstanding during the year, plus the effect of common stock equivalents (for example, stock options, restricted share rights,
convertible debentures and warrants) that are dilutive.       Derivatives and Hedging Activities    
  We recognize all derivatives in the balance sheet at fair value. On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we designate the derivative as
(1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, including hedges of foreign currency exposure ( fair value  hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or
paid related to a recognized asset or liability ( cash flow  hedge), or (3) held for trading, customer accommodation or asset/liability risk management purposes, including economic hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting. For a
fair value hedge, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative and, to the extent that it is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, in current period earnings in the same
financial statement category as the hedged item. For a cash flow hedge, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative to the extent that it is effective in OCI, with any ineffectiveness recorded in current period earnings. We subsequently
reclassify these changes in fair value to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction affects net income in the same financial statement category as the hedged item. For free-standing derivatives, we report changes in the fair
values in current period noninterest income.      For fair value and cash flow hedges qualifying for hedge accounting, we
formally document at inception the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our evaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This includes linking all derivatives designated as
fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities in the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. Periodically, as required, we also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is
expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item using the regression analysis method or, in limited cases, the dollar offset method.   
  We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair
value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, because it is unlikely that a forecasted

transaction will occur, or (4) we elect to discontinue the designation of a derivative as a hedge.      When we discontinue hedge accounting because a derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, we continue to carry the derivative in the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in
fair value included in earnings, and no longer adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. Previous adjustments to the hedged item are accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of the
asset or liability.      When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting because the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or no
longer designated (de-designated), the amount reported in OCI up to the date of sale, termination or de-designation continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings.   
  When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we continue to carry
the derivative in the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings, and immediately recognize gains and losses that were accumulated in OCI in earnings.   
  In all other situations in which we discontinue hedge accounting, the derivative will be carried at its fair value in the balance sheet,
with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.      We occasionally purchase or originate financial
instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception of the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the
financial instrument (host contract), (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate it from the host contract by recording the bifurcated derivative at fair value
and the remaining host contract at the difference between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried as a free-standing derivative at fair value with changes recorded in
current period earnings.       Private Share Repurchases       In December 2011, we entered into a private forward repurchase contract with an unrelated third party. This contract settled for approximately 6 million shares of our common stock in first quarter 2012.
We also entered into a similar contract in August 2011, which settled in November 2011 for approximately 6 million shares of our common stock. These contracts met accounting requirements to be treated as permanent equity transactions. We
entered into these contracts to complement our open-market common stock repurchase strategies, to allow us to manage our share repurchases in a manner consistent with our 2011 Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
plan (capital plan), and to provide an economic benefit to the Company. In connection with each contract, we paid $150 million to the

129   

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    (continued)       

counterparty, which was recorded in permanent equity and was not subject to re-measurement. These up-front payments received permanent equity treatment in the quarter paid and thus assured
appropriate repurchase timing, consistent with our 2011 capital plan which contemplated a fixed dollar amount available per quarter for share repurchases pursuant to FRB supervisory guidance. In return, the counterparty agreed to

deliver a variable number of shares based on a per share discount to the volume-weighted average stock price over the contract period. The counterparty had the right to accelerate settlement with
delivery of shares prior to the contractual settlement. There were no scenarios where the contracts would not either physically settle in shares or allow us to choose the settlement method.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW
INFORMATION   Noncash activities are presented below, including information on transfers affecting MHFS, LHFS and MSRs.       

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   We have evaluated the effects of subsequent events that have occurred
subsequent to period end December 31, 2011, and there have been no material events that would require recognition in our 2011 consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to the financial statements, except as discussed in Note
15 (Legal Actions) for the announcement on February 9, 2012, of an agreement with state attorneys and federal agencies regarding mortgage servicing, foreclosures and origination issues.

Note 2: Business Combinations    

We regularly explore opportunities to acquire financial services companies and businesses. Generally, we do
not make a public announcement about an acquisition opportunity until a definitive agreement has been signed. For information on additional contingent consideration related to acquisitions, which is considered to be a guarantee, see Note 14.

Business combinations completed in 2011, 2010 and 2009 are presented below. At
December 31, 2011, we had two acquisitions pending, both of which are expected to close during first quarter 2012 with combined total assets of approximately $835 million.

(1)  
  Consists of seven acquisitions of insurance brokerage businesses.     

(2)  
  Consists of five acquisitions of insurance brokerage businesses.     

(3)  
  Consists of eight acquisitions of insurance brokerage businesses.     
         131   

Note 3: Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions    

Federal Reserve Board (FRB) regulations require that each of our subsidiary banks maintain reserve balances
on deposit with the Federal Reserve Banks. The average required reserve balance was $7.0 billion in 2011 and $6.0 billion in 2010.      Federal law restricts the amount and the terms of both credit and non-credit transactions between a bank and its nonbank affiliates. These transaction amounts may not exceed 10% of the bank s capital
and surplus, which for this purpose represents total capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses in excess of the amount included in total capital with any single nonbank
affiliate and 20% of the bank s capital and surplus with all its nonbank affiliates. Transactions that are extensions of credit may require collateral to be held to provide added security to the bank. For further discussion of RBC, see Note 26.
     Dividends paid by our subsidiary banks are subject to various federal and state regulatory limitations. Dividends that may
be paid by a national bank without the express approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are limited to that bank s retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any
dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period.      We also have state-chartered subsidiary banks that are subject to state regulations that limit dividends. Under those provisions, our national and state-chartered subsidiary banks could have declared
additional dividends of $0.6 billion at December 31, 2011, without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and

state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year. Based on retained earnings at December 31, 2011, our nonbank subsidiaries
could have declared additional dividends of $5.7 billion at December 31, 2011, without obtaining prior approval.   
  The FRB published clarifying supervisory guidance in 2009,  SR 09-4 Applying Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on the Payment of
Dividends, Stock Redemptions, and Stock Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies,  pertaining to FRB s criteria, assessment and approval process for reductions in capital including the redemption of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the
payment of dividends. The effect of this guidance is to require the approval of the FRB for the Company to repurchase or redeem common or perpetual preferred stock as well as to increase the per share dividend from its current level of $0.12 per
share. In November 2010, the FRB updated the SR 09-4 guidance to require the original 19 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) banks to submit a Capital Plan Review to the FRB no later than January 7, 2011. In December 2011, the FRB
finalized rules under 12 CFR Part 225, Regulation Y requiring large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit capital plans annually and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions including share dividend increases or share
repurchases. The rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a BHC s risk profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions. The Company submitted its board-approved 2012 capital plan to the FRB on
January 6, 2012.   

Note 4: Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements and Other Short-Term Investments

The following table provides the detail of federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale
agreements, and other short-term investments.       
    We receive collateral from other entities under resale agreements and securities borrowings. For additional information,
see Note 14.   

132   

Note 5: Securities Available for Sale    

The following table provides the cost and fair value for the major categories of securities available for
sale carried at fair value.

There were no securities classified as held to maturity as of the periods presented.

(2)  
  Included in the  Other  category are asset-backed securities collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash reserves with a cost basis and fair value of $6.7 billion
each at December 31, 2011, and $6.2 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Also included in the  Other  category are asset-backed securities collateralized by home equity loans with a cost basis and fair
value of $846 million and $932 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and $927 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The remaining balances primarily include asset-backed securities collateralized by credit
cards and student loans.     

(3)  
  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held no securities of any single issuer (excluding the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies) with a book value that exceeded 10% of
stockholders  equity.     
         133   

Note 5: Securities Available for Sale    (continued)       

Gross Unrealized Losses and Fair Value       The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities in the securities available-for-sale portfolio by length of time that individual securities in each category had been in
a continuous loss position. Debt securities on which we

have taken credit-related OTTI write-downs are categorized as being  less than 12 months  or  12 months or more  in a continuous loss position based on the point in time that
the fair value declined to below the cost basis and not the period of time since the credit-related OTTI write-down.   

134   

We do not have the intent to sell any securities included in the previous table. For debt securities
included in the table, we have concluded it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We have assessed each security with gross unrealized losses for credit impairment. For debt
securities, we evaluate, where necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the present value of the expected cash flows to the securities  amortized cost basis. For equity securities, we consider numerous factors in determining
whether impairment exists, including our intent and ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to recover the cost basis of the securities.      See Note 1    Securities  for the factors that we consider in our analysis of OTTI for debt and equity securities available for sale.   
   SECURITIES OF U.S. TREASURY AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND FEDERAL AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS)   The unrealized losses associated
with U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities and federal agency MBS are primarily driven by changes in interest rates and not due to credit losses given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.   
   SECURITIES OF U.S. STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS   The unrealized losses associated with securities of U.S. states and political
subdivisions are primarily driven by changes in interest rates and not due to the credit quality of the securities. Substantially all of these investments are investment grade. The securities were generally underwritten in accordance with our own
investment standards prior to the decision to purchase. Some of these securities are guaranteed by a bond insurer, but we did not rely on this guarantee in making our investment decision. These investments will continue to be monitored as part of
our ongoing impairment analysis, but are expected to perform, even if the rating agencies reduce the credit rating of the bond insurers. As a result, we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.   
   RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MBS   The unrealized losses associated with private residential MBS and commercial MBS are primarily driven by
changes in projected collateral losses, credit spreads and interest rates. We assess for credit impairment by estimating the present value of expected cash flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash flows include default rates, loss
severities and prepayment rates. We estimate losses to a security by forecasting the underlying mortgage loans in each transaction. We use forecasted loan performance to project cash flows to the various tranches in the structure. We also consider
cash flow forecasts and, as applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, and other independent market data. Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit enhancement level of the
securities, we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.       CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES   The
unrealized losses associated with corporate debt securities are primarily related to unsecured debt obligations issued by various corporations. We

evaluate the financial performance of each issuer on a quarterly basis to determine that the issuer can make all contractual principal and interest payments. Based upon this assessment, we expect
to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.       COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOs)   The unrealized
losses associated with CDOs relate to securities primarily backed by commercial, residential or other consumer collateral. The unrealized losses are primarily driven by changes in projected collateral losses, credit spreads and interest rates. We
assess for credit impairment by estimating the present value of expected cash flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash flows include default rates, loss severities and prepayment rates. We also consider cash flow forecasts and, as
applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, and other independent market data. Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit enhancement level of the securities, we expect to
recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.       OTHER DEBT SECURITIES   The unrealized losses associated with
other debt securities primarily relate to other asset-backed securities. The losses are primarily driven by changes in projected collateral losses, credit spreads and interest rates. We assess for credit impairment by estimating the present value of
expected cash flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash flows include default rates, loss severities and prepayment rates. Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit enhancement level of the securities, we
expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities.       MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES   Our marketable equity
securities include investments in perpetual preferred securities, which provide very attractive tax-equivalent yields. We evaluated these hybrid financial instruments with investment-grade ratings for impairment using an evaluation methodology
similar to that used for debt securities. Perpetual preferred securities are not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if there is no evidence of credit deterioration or investment rating downgrades of any issuers to below investment
grade, and we expect to continue to receive full contractual payments. We will continue to evaluate the prospects for these securities for recovery in their market value in accordance with our policy for estimating OTTI. We have recorded impairment
write-downs on perpetual preferred securities where there was evidence of credit deterioration.       OTHER SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE
MATTERS   The fair values of our investment securities could decline in the future if the underlying performance of the collateral for the residential and commercial MBS or other securities deteriorate and our credit enhancement levels
do not provide sufficient protection to our contractual principal and interest. As a result, there is a risk that significant OTTI may occur in the future.

135   

Note 5: Securities Available for Sale    (continued)       

The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt and
perpetual preferred securities available for sale by those rated investment grade and those rated less than investment grade, according to their lowest credit rating by Standard   Poor s Rating Services (S P) or Moody s
Investors Service (Moody s). Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security. Securities rated investment grade, that is those rated BBB- or higher by S P or Baa3 or higher by Moody s, are generally considered by
the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, securities rated below investment grade, labeled as  speculative grade  by the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than
investment grade securities. We have also

included securities not rated by S P or Moody s in the table below based on the internal credit grade of the securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to the
credit rating assigned by major credit agencies. The unrealized losses and fair value of unrated securities categorized as investment grade based on internal credit grades were $207 million and $6.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011,
and $83 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. If an internal credit grade was not assigned, we categorized the security as non-investment grade.

136   

Contractual Maturities       The following table shows the remaining contractual maturities and contractual yields of debt securities available for sale. The remaining contractual principal maturities for MBS do not consider
prepayments. Remaining expected maturities will differ

from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature.

137   

Note 5: Securities Available for Sale    (continued)       

Realized Gains and Losses       The following table shows the gross realized gains and losses on sales and OTTI write-downs related to the securities available-for-sale portfolio, which includes marketable equity securities, as well as
net realized gains and losses on nonmarketable equity securities (see Note 7   Other Assets).       
     Other-Than-Temporary Impairment       The following table shows the detail of total OTTI write-downs included in earnings for debt securities and marketable and nonmarketable equity securities.

(1)  
  For the year ended December 31, 2010, amount represents OTTI recognized on federal agency MBS because we had the intent to sell, of which $252 million related to securities
with a fair value of $14.5 billion that were sold subsequent to December 31, 2010.     
         138   

Other-Than-Temporarily Impaired Debt Securities    
  The following table shows the detail of OTTI write-downs on debt securities available for sale included in earnings and the related changes in OCI for the
same securities.   

(2)  
  Represents amounts recorded to OCI on debt securities in periods OTTI write-downs have occurred. Changes in fair value in subsequent periods on such securities, to the extent
additional credit-related OTTI did not occur, are not reflected in this total. Increases represent OTTI write-downs recorded to OCI on debt securities in the periods non-credit related impairment has occurred. Decreases represent partial recoveries
in the fair value of securities due to factors other than credit, where the increase in fair value was not sufficient to recover the full amount of the unrealized loss on such securities.     

The following table presents a rollforward of the credit loss component of OTTI recognized in earnings for
debt securities we still own (referred to as  credit-impaired  debt securities). The credit loss component of the amortized cost represents the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows discounted using the
security s current effective interest rate and the amortized cost basis of the security prior to considering credit losses. OTTI recognized in earnings for credit-impaired debt securities is presented as additions and is classified into one of
two components based upon whether the current period is the first time the debt security was
credit-  

impaired (initial credit impairment) or if the debt security was previously credit-impaired (subsequent credit impairments). The credit loss component is reduced if we sell, intend to sell or
believe we will be required to sell previously credit-impaired debt securities. Additionally, the credit loss component is reduced if we receive or expect to receive cash flows in excess of what we previously expected to receive over the remaining
life of the credit-impaired debt security, the security matures or is fully written down.      Changes in the credit loss
component of credit-impaired debt securities that we do not intend to sell were:   

(1)  
  Recoveries of previous credit impairments result from increases in expected cash flows subsequent to credit loss recognition. Such recoveries are reflected prospectively as
interest yield adjustments using the effective interest method.     
         139   

Note 5: Securities Available for Sale    (continued)       

For asset-backed securities (e.g., residential MBS), we estimate expected future cash flows of the security
by estimating the expected future cash flows of the underlying collateral and applying those collateral cash flows, together with any credit enhancements such as subordinated interests owned by third parties, to the security. The expected future
cash flows of the underlying collateral are determined using the remaining contractual cash flows adjusted for future expected credit losses (which consider current delinquencies and nonperforming assets

(NPAs), future expected default rates and collateral value by vintage and geographic region) and prepayments. The expected cash flows of the security are then discounted at the security s
current effective interest rate to arrive at a present value amount. Total credit impairment losses on residential MBS that we do not intend to sell are shown in the table below. The table also presents a summary of the significant inputs considered
in determining the measurement of the credit loss component recognized in earnings for residential MBS.   

(1)  
  Represents future expected credit losses on underlying pool of loans expressed as a percentage of total current outstanding loan balance.     

(2)  
  Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the individual securities within each category.     

(3)  
  Represents distribution of credit impairment losses recognized in earnings categorized based on range of expected remaining life of loan losses. For example 42% of credit
impairment losses recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011, had expected remaining life of loan loss assumptions of 0 to 10%.     

(4)  
  Calculated by weighting the relevant input/assumption for each individual security by current outstanding amortized cost basis of the security.     

(5)  
  Represents current level of credit protection (subordination) for the securities, expressed as a percentage of total current underlying loan balance.     

(6)  
  Constant prepayment rate.     
         140   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses      

The following table presents total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing
receivable. Outstanding balances include a total net reduction of $9.3 billion and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for unearned income, net deferred loan fees, and unamortized discounts and

premiums. Outstanding balances also include PCI loans net of any remaining purchase accounting adjustments. Information about PCI loans is presented separately in the  Purchased
Credit-Impaired Loans  section of this Note.   

(1)  
  Substantially all of our foreign loan portfolio is commercial loans. Loans are classified as foreign if the borrower s primary address is outside of the United States.

Loan concentrations may exist when there are amounts loaned to borrowers engaged in
similar activities or similar types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have concentrations
representing 10% or more of our total loan portfolio in domestic commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry or CRE loans (real estate mortgage and real estate construction) by state or property type. Our real estate 1-4 family
mortgage loans to borrowers in the state of California represented approximately 13% of total loans at December 31, 2011 and 14% at December 31, 2010. For both periods, 3% of the amount were PCI loans. These loans are generally
diversified among the larger metropolitan areas in California, with no single area consisting of more than 3% of total loans. We continuously monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for all geographic areas
of our real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management process.      Some of our real estate 1-4
family first and junior lien mortgage loans include an interest-only feature as part of the loan terms. These interest-only loans were approximately 21% of total loans at December 31, 2011 and 25% at December 31, 2010.
Substantially all of these interest-only loans at origination were considered to be prime or near prime. We do not offer option adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts,
commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans.

The following table summarizes the proceeds paid or received for purchases and sales of
loans and transfers from (to) mortgages/loans held for sale at lower of cost or market. This loan activity primarily includes purchases or sales of commercial loan participation interests, whereby we receive or transfer a portion of a loan after
origination. The table excludes PCI loans and loans recorded at fair value, including loans originated for sale because their loan activity normally does not impact the allowance for credit losses.

141   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       

(1)  
  The  Purchases  and  Transfers (from)/to MHFS/LHFS  categories exclude activity in government insured/guaranteed loans where Wells Fargo acts as servicer. On
a net basis, this activity was $10.4 billion and $7.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.     

Commitments to Lend       A commitment to extend credit is a legally binding agreement to lend funds to a customer, usually at a stated interest rate and for a specified purpose. These commitments have fixed expiration dates and
generally require a fee. When we make such a commitment, we have credit risk. The liquidity requirements or credit risk will be lower than the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portion of these commitments are
expected to expire without being used. Certain commitments are subject to loan agreements with covenants regarding the financial performance of the customer or borrowing base formulas that must be met before we are required to fund the commitment.
Also, in some cases we participate a portion of our commitment to others in an arrangement that reduces our contractual commitment amount. We use the same credit policies in extending credit for unfunded commitments and letters of credit that we use
in making loans. See Note 14 for information on standby letters of credit.      In addition, we manage the potential risk in
credit commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and by applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities.

For certain extensions of credit, we may require collateral, based on our assessment of a
customer s credit risk. We hold various types of collateral, including accounts receivable, inventory, land, buildings, equipment, autos, financial instruments, income-producing commercial properties and residential real estate. Collateral
requirements for each customer may vary according to the specific credit underwriting, terms and structure of loans funded immediately or under a commitment to fund at a later date.   
  The contractual amount of our unfunded credit commitments, net of participations and net of all standby and commercial letters of credit
issued under the terms of these commitments, is summarized by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable in the following table:       

142   

Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)       The ACL is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date. We have an established process to determine the
adequacy of the allowance for credit losses that assesses the losses inherent in our portfolio and related unfunded credit commitments. While we attribute portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance is available to
absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments.      Our process involves procedures
to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans with similar characteristics, individually or pooled
for impaired loans or, for PCI loans, based on the changes in cash flows expected to be collected.      Our allowance levels are
influenced by loan volumes, loan grade migration or delinquency status, historic loss experience influencing loss factors, and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as economic conditions.   
   COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  Generally, commercial loans are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk
factors as identified through periodic reviews. We apply historic grade-specific loss factors to the aggregation of each funded grade pool. These historic loss factors are also used to estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments. In the
development of our statistically derived loan grade loss factors, we observe historical losses over a relevant period for each loan grade. These loss estimates are adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of long-term average loss
experience compared to previously forecasted losses, external loss data or other risks identified from current economic conditions and credit quality trends.      The allowance also includes an amount for the estimated impairment on nonaccrual commercial loans and commercial loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.   
   CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  For consumer loans, not identified as a TDR, we determine the allowance predominantly on a collective
basis utilizing forecasted losses to represent our best estimate of inherent loss. We pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve
greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, origination channel, vintage, loss type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. Models designed for each pool are utilized to develop the loss
estimates. We use assumptions for these pools in our forecast models, such as historic delinquency and default, loss severity, home price trends, unemployment trends, and other key economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of
losses in the pool.      In determining the appropriate allowance attributable to our residential mortgage portfolio, we
incorporate the default rates and high severity of loss for junior lien mortgages behind

delinquent first lien mortgages into our loss forecasting calculations. In addition, the loss rates we use in determining our allowance include the impact of our established loan modification
programs. When modifications occur or are probable to occur, our allowance considers the impact of these modifications, taking into consideration the associated credit cost, including re-defaults of modified loans and projected loss severity.
Accordingly, the loss content associated with the effects of existing and probable loan modifications and junior lien mortgages behind delinquent first lien mortgages has been captured in our allowance methodology.   
  We separately estimate impairment for consumer loans that have been modified in a TDR (including trial modifications), whether on
accrual or nonaccrual status.       OTHER ACL MATTERS  The allowance for credit losses for both portfolio segments includes an amount for
imprecision or uncertainty that may change from period to period. This amount represents management s judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance. This imprecision considers economic
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and ongoing discussions with regulatory and government agencies regarding mortgage foreclosure-related matters.
     Impaired loans, which predominantly include nonaccrual commercial loans and any loans that have been modified in a TDR, have
an estimated allowance calculated as the difference, if any, between the impaired value of the loan and the recorded investment in the loan. The impaired value of the loan is generally calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows
from principal and interest which incorporates expected lifetime losses, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate. The allowance for a non-impaired loan is based solely on principal losses without consideration for timing of those
losses. The allowance for an impaired loan that was modified in a TDR may be lower than the previously established allowance for that loan due to benefits received through modification, such as lower probability of default and/or severity of loss,
and the impact of prior charge-offs or charge-offs at the time of the modification that may reduce or eliminate the need for an allowance.      Commercial and consumer PCI loans may require an allowance subsequent to their acquisition. This allowance requirement is due to probable decreases in expected principal and interest cash flows (other
than due to decreases in interest rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions).   

143   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       
        The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for
loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. Changes in the allowance for credit losses were:       

(1)  
  Certain impaired loans with an allowance calculated by discounting expected cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate over the remaining life of the loan recognize
reductions in allowance as interest income.     

(2)  
  For PCI loans, charge-offs are only recorded to the extent that losses exceed the purchase accounting estimates.     

144   

The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses by our commercial and
consumer portfolio segments.       
    The following table disaggregates our allowance for credit losses and recorded investment in loans by impairment
methodology.       

(1)  
  Represents loans collectively evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC 450-20,  Loss Contingencies  (formerly FAS 5), and pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20
regarding allowance for unimpaired loans.     

(2)  
  Represents loans individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC 310-10,  Receivables  (formerly FAS 114), and pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20 regarding
allowance for impaired loans.     

(3)  
  Represents the allowance and related loan carrying value determined in accordance with ASC 310-30 , Receivables   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated
Credit Quality  (formerly SOP 03-3) and pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20 regarding allowance for PCI loans.     

Credit Quality       We monitor credit quality as indicated by evaluating various attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The following sections provide
the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor. See the  Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans  section of this Note for credit quality information on our PCI portfolio.   
  The majority of credit quality indicators are based on December 31, 2011 information, with the exception of updated FICO and
updated loan-to-value (LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV), which are obtained at least quarterly. Generally, these indicators are updated in the second month of each quarter, with updates no older than September 30, 2011.   
   COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  In addition to monitoring commercial loan concentration risk, we manage a consistent process for assessing
commercial loan credit quality. Commercial loans are subject to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to Pass and Criticized categories. The Criticized

category includes Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful categories which are defined by bank regulatory agencies.      The following table provides a breakdown of outstanding commercial loans by risk category. Both the CRE mortgage and construction criticized totals are relatively high as a result of the current
conditions in the real estate market. Of the $29.3 billion in criticized CRE loans, $6.0 billion has been placed on nonaccrual status and written down to net realizable value. CRE loans have a high level of monitoring in place to manage these assets
and mitigate any loss exposure.   

145   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       
         
        The following table provides past
due information for      commercial loans, which we monitor as part of our credit risk      management practices.       

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY   INDICATORS  We have various classes of consumer loans that present
respective unique risks. Loan delinquency, FICO credit scores and LTV for loan types are common credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio
segment.      The majority of our loss estimation techniques used for the allowance for credit losses rely on delinquency matrix
models or

delinquency roll rate models. Therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality and the establishment of our allowance for credit losses.

146   

The following table provides the outstanding balances of our consumer portfolio by delinquency status.

(1)  
  Represents loans whose repayments are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA and student loans whose repayments are predominantly guaranteed by agencies on behalf of the U.S.
Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). In 2011, we consolidated $5.6 billion of previously sold FHA insured real estate 1-4 family reverse mortgages.     

(2)  
  Amounts at December 31, 2010, have been revised to conform to the current separate presentation of government insured/guaranteed loans.     

Of the $11.5 billion of loans that are 90 days or more past due at December 31,
2011, $1.5 billion was accruing, compared with $13.0 billion past due and $2.0 billion accruing at December 31, 2010.   
  Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans 180 days or more past due totaled $6.7 billion, or 3.3%, of total first mortgages (excluding
PCI), at December 31, 2011, compared with $6.8 billion, or 3.4%, at December 31, 2010. The aging of the delinquent real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans is a result of the prolonged foreclosure process and our effort to help
customers stay in their homes through various loan modification programs, as loans continue to age until these processes are complete.      The following table provides a breakdown of our consumer portfolio by updated FICO. We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are updated at least quarterly. FICO is not available for
certain loan types. In addition, FICO may not be obtained if we deem it unnecessary due to strong collateral and other borrower attributes, primarily securities-based margin loans of $5.0 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively. The majority of our portfolio is underwritten with a FICO score of 680 and above.

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       

(1)  
  Represents loans whose repayments are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA and student loans whose repayments are predominantly guaranteed by agencies on behalf of the U.S.
Department of Education under FFELP. In 2011, we consolidated $5.6 billion of previously sold FHA insured real estate 1-4 family reverse mortgages.     

(2)  
  Amounts at December 31, 2010, have been revised to conform to the current separate presentation of government insured/guaranteed loans.     

LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan s balance to the property s
collateral value. CLTV refers to the combination of first mortgage and junior lien mortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line products) ratios. LTVs and CLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade approach which first uses values
provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is not
available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high value properties as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties.   
  The following table shows the most updated LTV and CLTV distribution of the real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loan
portfolios. In recent years, the residential real estate markets have experienced significant declines in property

values and several markets, particularly California and Florida have experienced declines that turned out to be more significant than the national decline. These trends are considered in the way
that we monitor credit risk and establish our allowance for credit losses. LTV does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of performance of a given loan, but does provide an indication of collateral value. In the event of a default, any loss should
be limited to the portion of the loan amount in excess of the net realizable value of the underlying real estate collateral value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV primarily due to industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or
serviced by other institutions.

  Amounts at December 31, 2010, have been revised to conform to the current separate presentation of government insured/guaranteed loans.     

(2)  
  Reflects total loan balances with LTV/CLTV amounts in excess of 100%. In the event of default, the loss content would generally be limited to only the amount in excess of 100%

  Represents loans whose repayments are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. In 2011, we consolidated $5.6 billion of previously sold FHA insured real estate 1-4 family
reverse mortgages.     

NONACCRUAL   LOANS  The following table provides loans on nonaccrual status. PCI loans are
excluded from this table due to the existence of the accretable yield.       

149   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Certain loans 90 days or more past due as to
interest or principal are still accruing, because they are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as
nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days past due. PCI loans of $8.7 billion at December 31, 2011, and $11.6 billion at December 31, 2010, are excluded from this disclosure even though they are 90 days or more contractually
past due. These PCI loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield and not based on consideration given to contractual interest payments. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose repayments are
insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were
$20.5 billion at December 31, 2011, up from $15.8 billion at December 31, 2010, due primarily to growth in the FHA/VA portfolio over the past two years and the subsequent seasoning of those loans.   
  The following table shows non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing by class for loans not government
insured/guaranteed.       

(1)  
  Represents loans whose repayments are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA.     

(2)  
  Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly guaranteed by agencies on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education under the FFELP.     

(3)  
  Includes mortgage held for sale 90 days or more past due and still accruing.

IMPAIRED LOANS   The table below summarizes key information for impaired loans. Our
impaired loans predominately include loans on nonaccrual status in the commercial portfolio segment and loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual status. These impaired loans may have estimated loss which is included in the allowance
for credit losses. Impaired loans exclude PCI loans. Upon our adoption of ASU No. 2011-02 in third quarter 2011, we identified commercial loans that were not previously included as impaired loans, which totaled $685 million with an associated
allowance for credit losses of $54 million. The allowance for credit losses associated with these

loans would have been measured under a collectively evaluated basis prior to adoption, but is now estimated on an individually evaluated basis. Our consumer loans were not impacted by the
adoption of ASU No. 2011-02. Additionally, based on clarifying guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received in December 2011, we now classify trial modifications as TDRs at the beginning of the trial period. The table
below includes trial modifications that totaled $651 million at December 31, 2011. See the  Loans  section in Note 1 for our policies on impaired loans and PCI loans.

151   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses (continued)    

Commitments to lend additional funds on loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR
amounted to $3.8 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A significant portion of these commitments relate to commercial and industrial loans, which, at the time of modification, had an amount of availability to
the borrower that continues under the modified terms of the TDR. These TDRs

totaled $1.8 billion and $345 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      The following table provides the average recorded investment in impaired loans and the amount of interest income recognized for the full year on impaired loans after impairment by portfolio segment and
class.   

The following table presents the average recorded investment in impaired loans and interest income
recognized on impaired loans after impairment.       

(1)  
  Includes interest recognized on accruing TDRs, interest recognized related to certain impaired loans which have an allowance calculated using discounting, and amortization of
purchase accounting adjustments related to certain impaired loans. See footnote 1 to the table of changes in the allowance for credit losses.     
         152   

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  When, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s
financial difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. We

do not consider any loans modified through a loan resolution such as foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. The following table summarizes how our loans were modified as TDRs in 2011, including
the financial effects of the modifications.   

(1)  
  Amounts represent the recorded investment in loans after recognizing the effects of the TDR, if any. TDRs with multiple types of concessions are presented only once in the table
in the first category type based on the order presented.     

(2)  
  Principal modifications include principal forgiveness at the time of the modification, contingent principal forgiveness granted over the life of the loan based on borrower
performance, and principal that has been legally separated and deferred to the end of the loan, with a zero percent contractual interest rate.     

(3)  
  Other interest rate concessions include loans modified to an interest rate that is not commensurate with the credit risk, even though the rate may have been increased. These
modifications would include renewals, term extensions, and other interest adjustments, but exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or reduce the interest rate.     

(4)  
  Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period of modification. In some cases, the amount of charge-offs will differ from the modification terms if
the loan has already been charged down based on our policies. Modifications resulted in forgiving principal (actual, contingent or deferred) of $577 million in 2011.     

(5)  
  Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency
status and accrue interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not known until
the loan is permanently modified.     
         153   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       

The previous table presents information on all loan modifications classified as TDRs. We may require some
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period of three to four months, according to terms of a planned permanent modification, to determine if they can perform according to those terms. Based on clarifying
guidance from the SEC in December 2011, these arrangements represent trial modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. The trial period terms are developed in accordance with our proprietary programs or the U.S. Treasury s Making
Homes Affordable programs for real estate 1-4 family first lien (i.e. Home Affordable Modification Program   HAMP) and junior lien (i.e. Second Lien Modification Program   2MP) mortgage loans. At December 31, 2011, we had $421
million, $46 million, and $184 million of loans in a trial modification period under HAMP, 2MP, and proprietary programs, respectively. While loans are in trial payment programs their original terms are not considered modified and they continue to
advance through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. The planned modifications for these arrangements predominantly involve interest rate reductions or other interest rate concessions. At December 31, 2011,
trial modifications with a recorded investment of $310 million were accruing loans and $341 million were nonaccruing loans. Our recent experience is that most of the mortgages that enter a trial payment period program are successful in completing
the program requirements and are then permanently modified at the end of the trial period. As previously discussed, our allowance process considers the impact of those modifications that are probable to occur including the associated credit cost and
related re-default risk.      The table below summarizes permanent modification TDRs that have defaulted in the current period
within 12 months of their permanent modification date. We are reporting these defaulted TDRs based on a payment default definition of 90 days past due for the commercial portfolio segment and 60 days past due for the consumer portfolio segment.

154   

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans       Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired from Wachovia on December 31, 2008. The following table presents PCI loans net of any remaining purchase accounting adjustments.

ACCRETABLE YIELD  The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI
loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of the loan, or pools of loans. The accretable yield is affected by:   

Changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans   Expected future cash flows are based on the variable rates in effect at the time of
the regular evaluations of cash flows expected to be collected;      

Changes in prepayment assumptions   Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans which may change the

amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected; and      

Changes in the expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life   Updates to expected cash flows are driven by the credit outlook
and actions taken with borrowers. Changes in expected future cash flows from loan modifications are included in the regular evaluations of cash flows expected to be collected.      
  The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.

(1)  
  Includes accretable yield released as a result of settlements with borrowers, which is included in interest income.     

(2)  
  Includes accretable yield released as a result of sales to third parties, which is included in noninterest income.     

(3)  
  Represents changes in cash flows expected to be collected due to changes in interest rates on variable rate PCI loans, changes in prepayment assumptions and the impact of
modifications.     
         155   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       

PCI ALLOWANCE  Based on our regular evaluation of estimates of cash flows expected to be collected,
we may establish an allowance for a PCI loan or pool of loans, with a

charge to income through the provision for losses. The following table summarizes the changes in allowance for PCI loan losses.

COMMERCIAL PCI CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  The following table provides a breakdown of commercial PCI loans by risk
category.       
 
         156   

The following table provides past due information for commercial PCI loans.   

CONSUMER PCI CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  Our consumer PCI loans were aggregated into several pools of
loans at acquisition. Below, we have provided credit quality indicators based on the unpaid principal balance (adjusted for write-downs) of the individual loans included in the pool, but

we have not allocated the remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which were established at a pool level. The following table provides the delinquency status of consumer PCI loans.

157   

Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses    (continued)       
        The following table provides FICO scores for consumer PCI loans.   
   
    The following table shows the distribution of consumer PCI loans by LTV for real estate 1-4 family first mortgages and by
CLTV for real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgages.       

(1)  
  Reflects total loan balances with LTV/CLTV amounts in excess of 100%. In the event of default, the loss content would generally be limited to only the amount in excess of 100%
LTV/CLTV.     
         158   

Note 7: Premises, Equipment, Lease Commitments and Other Assets

Depreciation and amortization expense for premises and equipment was $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion in 2011,
2010 and 2009, respectively.      Dispositions of premises and equipment, included in noninterest expense, resulted in net losses
of $17 million, $115 million and $22 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.      We have obligations under a number of
noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment. The terms of these leases are predominantly up to 15 years, with the longest up to 94 years, and many provide for periodic adjustment of rentals based on changes in various economic
indicators. Some leases also include a renewal option. The following table provides the future minimum payments under capital leases and noncancelable operating leases, net of sublease rentals, with terms greater than one year as of
December 31, 2011.       

Operating lease rental expense (predominantly for premises), net of rental income, was
$1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.      The components of other
assets were:       

(1)  
  Represents low income housing tax credit investments.     

(2)  
  Principal investments are recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in net gains (losses) from equity investments in the income
statement.     

(3)  
  These are foreclosed real estate securing FHA insured and VA guaranteed loans. Both principal and interest for these loans secured by the foreclosed real estate are
collectible because they are insured/guaranteed.        Income related to nonmarketable equity investments was:

Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities    

Involvement with SPEs       In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts or partnerships that are
established for a limited purpose. Historically, the majority of SPEs were formed in connection with securitization transactions. In a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to an SPE, which then issues to
investors various forms of interests in those assets and may also enter into derivative transactions. In a securitization transaction, we typically receive cash and/or other interests in an SPE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. Also, in
certain transactions, we may retain the right to service the transferred receivables and to repurchase those receivables from the SPE if the outstanding balance of the receivables falls to a level where the cost exceeds the benefits of servicing
such receivables. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans in an SPE that were transferred to the SPE by a third party.      In connection with our securitization activities, we have various forms of ongoing involvement with SPEs, which may include:   

underwriting securities issued by SPEs and subsequently making markets in those securities;      

providing liquidity facilities to support short-term obligations of SPEs issued to third party investors;      

providing credit enhancement on securities issued by SPEs or market value guarantees of assets held by SPEs through the use of letters of credit,
financial guarantees, credit default swaps and total return swaps;      

entering into other derivative contracts with SPEs;          

holding senior or subordinated interests in SPEs;          

acting as servicer or investment manager for SPEs; and      

providing administrative or trustee services to SPEs.

SPEs are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). A VIE is an entity that
has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the ability to control the entity s activities. A VIE is consolidated by its
primary beneficiary, the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. A variable interest is a contractual, ownership or other
interest that changes with changes in the fair value of the VIE s net assets. To determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding
the nature, size and form of our involvement with the VIE. We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an on-going basis.      We have segregated our involvement with VIEs between those VIEs which we consolidate, those which we do not consolidate and transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as secured borrowings.
Secured borrowings are transactions involving transfers of our financial assets to third parties that are accounted for as financings with the assets pledged as collateral. Accordingly, the transferred assets remain recognized on our balance sheet.
Subsequent tables within this Note further segregate these transactions by structure type.   

160   

The classifications of assets and liabilities in our balance sheet associated with our
transactions with VIEs follow:       

(1)  
  Excludes certain debt securities related to loans serviced for the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and
GNMA.     

(2)  
   VIEs that we consolidate  has been revised to correct previously reported amounts.     

Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs       Our transactions with VIEs include securitizations of residential mortgage loans, CRE loans, student loans and auto loans and leases; investment and financing activities involving CDOs backed by
asset-backed and CRE securities, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) backed by corporate loans, and other types of structured financing. We have various forms of involvement with VIEs, including holding senior or subordinated interests, entering
into liquidity arrangements, credit default swaps and other derivative contracts. Involvements with these unconsolidated VIEs are recorded on our balance sheet primarily in trading assets, securities available for sale, loans, MSRs, other assets and
other liabilities, as appropriate.   
 
   The following tables provide a summary of unconsolidated VIEs with which we have
significant continuing involvement, but we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our continuing involvement in an unconsolidated VIE to be significant when it relates to third-party sponsored VIEs for which we were not the transferor
or if we were the sponsor but do not have any other significant continuing involvement.      Significant continuing involvement
includes transactions where we were the sponsor or transferor and have other significant forms of involvement. Sponsorship includes transactions with unconsolidated VIEs where we solely or materially participated in the initial design or structuring
of the entity or marketing of the transaction to investors. When we transfer assets to a VIE and account for the transfer as a sale, we are considered the transferor. We consider investments in securities held outside of trading, loans, guarantees,
liquidity   

161   

Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities   
      (continued)           

agreements, written options and servicing of collateral to be other forms of involvement that may be
significant. We have excluded certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs from the balances presented in the table below where we have determined

that our continuing involvement is not significant due to the temporary nature and size of our variable interests, because we were not the transferor or because we were not involved in the design
or operations of the unconsolidated VIEs.   

(continued on following page)    
     
         162   

(continued from previous page)    

(1)  
  Includes total equity interests of $460 million and $316 million at December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. Also includes debt interests in the form of
both loans and securities. Excludes certain debt securities held related to loans serviced for FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA.     

(2)  
  Represents senior loans to trusts that are collateralized by asset-backed securities. The trusts invest primarily in senior tranches from a diversified pool of primarily U.S.
asset securitizations, of which all are current, and over 88% were rated as investment grade by the primary rating agencies at December 31, 2011. These senior loans were acquired in the Wachovia business combination and are accounted for at
amortized cost as initially determined under purchase accounting and are subject to the Company s allowance and credit charge-off policies.     

(3)  
  Includes structured financing, student loan securitizations, auto loan and lease securitizations and credit-linked note structures. Also contains investments in auction rate
securities (ARS) issued by VIEs that we do not sponsor and, accordingly, are unable to obtain the total assets of the entity.     
         163   

Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities        (continued)       

In the two preceding tables,  Total VIE assets  represents the remaining
principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the most current information available. For VIEs that obtain exposure to assets synthetically through derivative instruments, the remaining notional amount of the derivative is included
in the asset balance.  Carrying value  is the amount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs.  Maximum exposure to loss  from our involvement with off-balance sheet entities,
which is a required disclosure under GAAP, is determined as the carrying value of our involvement with off-balance sheet (unconsolidated) VIEs plus the remaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, the notional amount of net written
derivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. It represents estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for which we believe the
possibility is extremely remote, such as where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this required disclosure is not an
indication of expected loss.       RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Residential mortgage loan securitizations are financed through the issuance of
fixed- or floating-rate-asset-backed-securities, which are collateralized by the loans transferred to a VIE. We typically transfer loans we originated to these VIEs, account for the transfers as sales, retain the right to service the loans and may
hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs. We also may be exposed to limited liability related to recourse agreements and repurchase agreements we make to our issuers and purchasers, which are included in other commitments and guarantees.
In certain instances, we may service residential mortgage loan securitizations structured by third parties whose loans we did not originate or transfer. Our residential mortgage loan securitizations consist of conforming and nonconforming
securitizations.      Conforming residential mortgage loan securitizations are those that are guaranteed by GSEs, including GNMA.
We do not consolidate our conforming residential mortgage loan securitizations because we do not have power over the VIEs.   
  The loans sold to the VIEs in nonconforming residential mortgage loan securitizations are those that do not qualify for a GSE guarantee.
We may hold variable interests issued by the VIEs, primarily in the form of senior securities. We do not consolidate the nonconforming residential mortgage loan securitizations included in the table because we either do not hold any variable
interests, hold variable interests that we do not consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.      Other commitments and guarantees include amounts related to loans sold that we may be required to repurchase, or otherwise indemnify or reimburse the investor or insurer for losses incurred, due to
material breach of contractual representations and warranties. The maximum exposure to loss for material breach of contractual representations and warranties represents a stressed case estimate we utilize for

determining stressed case regulatory capital needs and is considered to be a remote scenario.       COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  Commercial mortgage loan securitizations are financed through the issuance of fixed- or floating-rate-asset-backed-securities, which are collateralized by
the loans transferred to the VIE. In a typical securitization, we may transfer loans we originate to these VIEs, account for the transfers as sales, retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs. In
certain instances, we may service commercial mortgage loan securitizations structured by third parties whose loans we did not originate or transfer. We typically serve as primary or master servicer of these VIEs. The primary or master servicer in a
commercial mortgage loan securitization typically cannot make the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE and therefore does not have power over the VIE. We do not consolidate the commercial mortgage loan securitizations
included in the disclosure because we either do not have power or do not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE.       COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOs)  A CDO is a securitization where an SPE purchases a pool of assets consisting of asset-backed securities and issues multiple tranches of equity or notes to
investors. In some transactions, a portion of the assets are obtained synthetically through the use of derivatives such as credit default swaps or total return swaps.      Prior to 2008, we engaged in the structuring of CDOs on behalf of third party asset managers who would select and manage the assets for the CDO. Typically, the asset manager has some discretion to manage
the sale of assets of, or derivatives used by the CDO, which generally gives the asset manager the power over the CDO. We have not structured these types of transactions since the credit market disruption began in late 2007.   
  In addition to our role as arranger we may have other forms of involvement with these transactions, including transactions established
prior to 2008. Such involvement may include acting as liquidity provider, derivative counterparty, secondary market maker or investor. For certain transactions, we may also act as the collateral manager or servicer. We receive fees in connection
with our role as collateral manager or servicer.      We assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of CDOs based on our role
in the transaction in combination with the variable interests we hold. Subsequently, we monitor our ongoing involvement in these transactions to determine if the nature of our involvement has changed. We are not the primary beneficiary of these
transactions in most cases because we do not act as the collateral manager or servicer, which generally denotes power. In cases where we are the collateral manager or servicer, we are not the primary beneficiary because we do not hold interests that
could potentially be significant to the VIE.      In 2011, we incurred a $377 million loss on trading derivatives related to
certain CDOs. The loss was associated with the resolution of a legacy Wachovia position that settled during the year.   

164   

COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS (CLOs)  A CLO is a securitization where an SPE purchases a pool of
assets consisting of loans and issues multiple tranches of equity or notes to investors. Generally, CLOs are structured on behalf of a third party asset manager that typically selects and manages the assets for the term of the CLO. Typically, the
asset manager has the power over the significant decisions of the VIE through its discretion to manage the assets of the CLO. We assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of CLOs based on our role in the transaction and the variable interests we
hold. In most cases, we are not the primary beneficiary of these transactions because we do not have the power to manage the collateral in the VIE.      In addition to our role as arranger, we may have other forms of involvement with these transactions. Such involvement may include acting as underwriter, derivative counterparty, secondary market maker or
investor. For certain transactions, we may also act as the servicer, for which we receive fees in connection with that role. We also earn fees for arranging these transactions and distributing the securities.   
   ASSET-BASED FINANCE STRUCTURES  We engage in various forms of structured finance arrangements with VIEs that are collateralized by various asset
classes including energy contracts, auto and other transportation leases, intellectual property, equipment and general corporate credit. We typically provide senior financing, and may act as an interest rate swap or commodity derivative counterparty
when necessary. In most cases, we are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have power over the significant activities of the VIEs involved in these transactions.   
  For example, we have investments in asset-backed securities that are collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash reserves. These
fixed-rate and variable-rate securities have been structured as single-tranche, fully amortizing, unrated bonds that are equivalent to investment-grade securities due to their significant overcollateralization. The securities are issued by VIEs that
have been formed by third party auto financing institutions primarily because they require a source of liquidity to fund ongoing vehicle sales operations. The third party auto financing institutions manage the collateral in the VIEs, which is
indicative of power in these transactions and we therefore do not consolidate these VIEs.       TAX CREDIT STRUCTURES  We co-sponsor and make
investments in affordable housing and sustainable energy projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. In some instances, our investments in these structures may require that we fund future
capital commitments at the discretion of the project sponsors. While the size of our investment in a single entity may at times exceed 50% of the outstanding equity interests, we do not consolidate these structures due to the project sponsor s
ability to manage the projects, which is indicative of power in these transactions.       INVESTMENT FUNDS  We do not consolidate the
investment funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected

future variability associated with the funds  assets, including variability associated with credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.   
  During 2011, we redeemed a $1.4 billion interest in an unconsolidated investment fund managed by one of our majority owned subsidiaries.
Upon redemption we placed the assets received into new investment fund VIEs. We consolidated these new VIEs because we have discretion over the management of the assets and are the sole investor in these funds. At December 31, 2010, we had
investments of $1.4 billion and lending arrangements of $14 million with this fund.       OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH VIEs  In 2008, legacy
Wachovia reached an agreement to purchase at par auction rate securities (ARS) that were sold to third-party investors by certain of its subsidiaries. ARS are debt instruments with long-term maturities, but which re-price more frequently, and
preferred equities with no maturity. We purchased all outstanding ARS that were issued by VIEs and subject to the agreement. At December 31, 2011, we held in our securities available-for-sale portfolio $643 million of ARS issued by VIEs
redeemed pursuant to this agreement, compared with $1.6 billion at December 31, 2010.      In 2009, we reached agreements to
purchase additional ARS from eligible investors who bought ARS through one of our broker-dealer subsidiaries. We purchased all outstanding ARS that were issued by VIEs and subject to the agreement. As of December 31, 2011, we held in our
securities available-for-sale portfolio $624 million of ARS issued by VIEs redeemed pursuant to this agreement, compared with $901 million at December 31, 2010.      We do not consolidate the VIEs that issued the ARS because we do not have power over the activities of the VIEs.       TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES  In addition to the involvements disclosed in the preceding table, through the issuance of trust preferred securities we had junior subordinated debt financing with a
carrying value of $7.6 billion at December 31, 2011, and $19.3 billion at December 31, 2010, and $2.5 billion of preferred stock at December 31, 2011. In these transactions, VIEs that we wholly own issue debt securities or preferred
equity to third party investors. All of the proceeds of the issuance are invested in debt securities or preferred equity that we issue to the VIEs. The VIEs  operations and cash flows relate only to the issuance, administration and repayment of
the securities held by third parties. We do not consolidate these VIEs because the sole assets of the VIEs are receivables from us. This is the case even though we own all of the voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the
obligations of the VIEs and may have the right to redeem the third party securities under certain circumstances. We report the debt securities issued to the VIEs as long-term junior subordinated debt and the preferred equity securities issued to the
VIEs as preferred stock in our consolidated balance sheet.      In 2011, we redeemed $9.2 billion of trust preferred securities
that will no longer count as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel Committee guidelines known as the Basel III standards.

Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities    (continued)       

Securitization Activity Related to Unconsolidated VIEs    
  We use VIEs to securitize consumer and CRE loans and other types of financial assets, including student loans and auto loans. We typically retain the
servicing rights from these sales and may continue to hold other beneficial interests in the VIEs. We may also provide liquidity to investors in the beneficial interests and credit enhancements in the form of standby letters of credit. Through these
securitizations we may be exposed to liability

under limited amounts of recourse as well as standard representations and warranties we make to purchasers and issuers.      In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized net gains of $112 million, $27 million, and $1 million, respectively, from transfers accounted for as sales of financial assets in securitizations. Additionally, we
had the following cash flows with our securitization trusts that were involved in transfers accounted for as sales.   

(1)  
  Represents cash flow data for all loans securitized in the period presented.     

Sales with continuing involvement during 2011 and 2010 predominantly related to
conforming residential mortgage securitizations. During 2011 and 2010, we transferred $329.1 billion and $379.0 billion, respectively, in fair value of conforming residential mortgages to unconsolidated VIEs and recorded the transfers as sales.
These transfers did not result in a gain or loss because the loans are already carried at fair value. In connection with these transfers, in 2011 we recorded a $4.0 billion servicing asset, measured at fair value using a Level 3 measurement
technique, and a $101 million liability for probable repurchase losses. In 2010, we recorded a $4.5 billion servicing asset, with $4.1 billion recorded at fair value as Level 3 and the remaining $400 million recorded as amortized mortgage
servicing rights. We also recorded a $144 million repurchase liability in 2010.      We used the following key weighted-average
assumptions to measure mortgage servicing assets at the date of securitization:       

(1)  
  Constant prepayment rate.

166   

Key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value to immediate
adverse changes in those assumptions at December 31, 2011, for residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights, and other interests held related primarily to residential mortgage loan securitizations are presented in the following table.
 Other interests held  exclude residential mortgage-backed securities retained in securitizations issued through GSEs, such as FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA, because these securities have a remote risk of credit loss due to the GSE

guarantee. These securities also have economic characteristics similar to GSE mortgage-backed securities that we purchase, which are not included in the table. Subordinated interests include only
those bonds whose credit rating was below AAA by a major rating agency at issuance. Senior interests include only those bonds whose credit rating was AAA by a major rating agency at issuance. The information presented excludes trading positions held
in inventory.   

The sensitivities in the preceding table are hypothetical and caution should be exercised
when relying on this data. Changes in value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a
particular assumption on the value of the other interests held is calculated independently without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in others (for example, changes in prepayment speed estimates
could result in changes in the credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

167   

Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities    (continued)       

The following table presents information about the principal balances of off-balance
sheet securitized loans, including residential mortgages sold to FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and securitizations where servicing is our only form of continuing involvement. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest as
well as nonaccrual loans. In securitizations where servicing is our only form of continuing

involvement, we would only experience a loss if required to repurchase a delinquent loan due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with our loan sale or servicing contracts.
Net charge-offs exclude loans sold to FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA as we do not service or manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to net charge-off information.

(1)  
  Balances have been revised to correct previously reported amounts.     

(2)  
  Balances have been revised to conform with current period presentation of including loans sold to FNMA, GNMA, and FHLMC.     
         168   

Transactions with Consolidated VIEs and Secured Borrowings    
  The following table presents a summary of transfers of financial assets accounted for as secured borrowings and involvements with consolidated VIEs.
 Consolidated assets  are presented using GAAP measurement methods, which may include fair value, credit impairment or other adjustments, and therefore in

some instances will differ from  Total VIE assets.  For VIEs that obtain exposure synthetically through derivative instruments, the remaining notional amount of the derivative is
included in  Total VIE assets.  On the consolidated balance sheet, we separately disclose the consolidated assets of certain VIEs that can only be used to settle the liabilities of those VIEs.

(1)  
  Includes $5.6 billion of reverse mortgage loans that were previously accounted for as a sale to a GNMA securitization program.     

(2)  
  Revised to correct previously reported amounts.     

In addition to the transactions included in the table above, at December 31, 2011,
we had issued approximately $6.0 billion of private placement debt financing through a consolidated VIE. The issuance is classified as long-term debt in our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2011, we had pledged approximately
$6.2 billion in loans (principal and interest eligible to be capitalized), $316 million in securities available for sale and $154 million in cash and cash equivalents to collateralize the VIE s borrowings. Such assets were not

transferred to the VIE and accordingly we have excluded the VIE from the previous table.      We have raised financing through the securitization of certain financial assets in transactions with VIEs accounted for as secured borrowings. We also consolidate VIEs where we are the primary
beneficiary. In certain transactions other than the multi-seller commercial paper conduit, we provide contractual support in the form of limited recourse and liquidity to facilitate the remarketing of short-term securities issued to third party

169   

Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities    (continued)       

investors. Other than this limited contractual support, the assets of the VIEs are the sole source of
repayment of the securities held by third parties. The liquidity support we provide to the multi-seller commercial paper conduit ensures timely repayment of commercial paper issued by the conduit and is described further below.   
   NONCONFORMING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS   We have consolidated certain of our nonconforming residential mortgage loan
securitizations in accordance with consolidation accounting guidance. We have determined we are the primary beneficiary of these securitizations because we have the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity through our role as
primary servicer and also hold variable interests that we have determined to be significant. The nature of our variable interests in these entities may include beneficial interests issued by the VIE, mortgage servicing rights and recourse or
repurchase reserve liabilities. The beneficial interests issued by the VIE that we hold include either subordinate or senior securities held in an amount that we consider potentially significant.   
   MULTI-SELLER COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT   We administer a multi-seller asset-based commercial paper conduit that finances certain client
transactions. This conduit is a bankruptcy remote entity that makes loans to, or purchases certificated interests, generally from SPEs, established by our clients (sellers) and which are secured by pools of financial assets. The conduit funds itself
through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper to third party investors. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the conduit s assets or the re-issuance of commercial paper upon maturity. The
conduit s assets are structured with deal-specific credit enhancements generally in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller, but may also include subordinated interests, cash reserve accounts, third party credit support
facilities and excess spread capture. The timely repayment of the commercial paper is further supported by asset-specific liquidity facilities in the form of liquidity asset purchase agreements that we provide. Each facility is equal to 102% of the
conduit s funding commitment to a client. The aggregate amount of liquidity must be equal to or greater than all the commercial paper issued by the conduit. At the discretion of the administrator, we may be required to purchase assets from the
conduit at par value plus accrued interest or discount on the related commercial paper, including situations where the conduit is unable to issue commercial paper. Par value may be different from fair value.   
  We receive fees in connection with our role as administrator and liquidity provider. We may also receive fees related to the structuring
of the conduit s transactions. In 2010, the conduit terminated its subordinated note to a third party investor and repaid all amounts due under the terms of the note agreement. We are the primary beneficiary of the conduit because we have power
over the significant activities of the conduit and have a significant variable interest due to our liquidity arrangement.

INVESTMENT FUNDS   We have consolidated certain of our investment funds where we manage the
assets of the fund and our interests absorb a majority of the funds  variability. In 2011, we redeemed our interest in an unconsolidated investment fund and placed the assets received upon redemption into new VIEs. We consolidate these VIEs
because we have discretion over the management of the assets and are the sole investor in these funds.   

170   

Note 9: Mortgage Banking Activities    

Mortgage banking activities, included in the Community Banking and Wholesale Banking operating segments,
consist of residential and commercial mortgage loan origination, sale activity and servicing.

We apply fair value method to substantially all of our residential MSRs and apply the
amortization method to all commercial and some residential MSRs. The changes in MSRs measured using the fair value method were:

(2)  
  Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in interest rates, and costs to service, including delinquency and
foreclosure costs.     

(3)  
  Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.        The changes in amortized MSRs were:       

(3)  
  Commercial amortized MSRs are evaluated for impairment purposes by the following risk strata: agency (GSEs) and non-agency. There was no valuation allowance recorded for the
periods presented on the commercial amortized MSRs. Residential amortized MSRs are evaluated for impairment purposes by the following risk strata: Mortgages sold to GSEs (FHLMC and FNMA) and mortgages sold to GNMA, each by interest rate
stratifications. A valuation allowance of $37 million and $3 million was recorded on the residential amortized MSRs for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.     
 
         171   

Note 9: Mortgage Banking Activities    (continued)       

We present the components of our managed servicing portfolio in the following table at
unpaid principal balance for

loans serviced and subserviced for others and at book value for owned loans serviced.

The components of mortgage banking noninterest income were:   

(1)  
  Primarily associated with foreclosure expenses and other interest costs.     

(2)  
  Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in interest rates and costs to service, including delinquency and
foreclosure costs.     

(3)  
  Represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time.     

(4)  
  Represents results from free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of MSRs. See Note 16   Free-Standing Derivatives for
additional discussion and detail.     
         172   

The following table summarizes the changes in our liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. This
liability is in  Accrued expenses and other liabilities  in our consolidated financial statements and the provision for repurchase losses reduces net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities. Because the level of mortgage loan
repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate
and requires considerable management judgment. We maintain regular contact with the GSEs and other significant investors to monitor and address their repurchase demand practices and concerns. Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates
underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is a range of losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability that are reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss for representations and warranties does not
represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. The high end of this range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our recorded liability
was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, and was determined based upon modifying the assumptions utilized in our best estimate of probable loss to reflect what we believe to be the high end of reasonably possible adverse assumptions.   

(2)  
  Results from such factors as credit deterioration, changes in investor demand and mortgage insurer practices, and changes in the financial stability of correspondent lenders.

173   

Note 10: Intangible Assets    
       The gross carrying value of
intangible assets and accumulated amortization was:       

(1)  
  Excludes fully amortized intangible assets.     

(2)  
  See Note 9 for additional information on MSRs.     

We based our projections of amortization expense shown below on existing asset balances
at December 31, 2011, with the exception of a portfolio of MSRs with a net carrying value of $313 million. Effective January 1, 2012, this portfolio of MSRs

will be transferring to MSRs carried at fair value. Future amortization expense may vary from these projections.      The following table provides the current year and estimated future amortization expense for amortized intangible assets.

174   

Note 10: Intangible Assets    (continued)       

For our goodwill impairment analysis, we allocate all of the goodwill to the individual
operating segments. We identify reporting units that are one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component), and distinguish these reporting units based on how the segments and components are managed, taking into consideration the
economic characteristics, nature of the products and customers of the components. We allocate

goodwill to reporting units based on relative fair value, using certain performance metrics. See Note 24 for further information on management reporting.   
  The following table shows the allocation of goodwill to our operating segments for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The
reduction in 2010 was predominately due to reversals of excess exit reserves.   

Note 11: Deposits    

Time certificates of deposit (CDs) and other time deposits issued by domestic offices totaled
$76.5 billion and $90.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Substantially all of these deposits were interest bearing. The contractual maturities of these deposits follow.   

Of these deposits, the amount of time deposits with a denomination of $100,000 or more
was $25.1 billion and $33.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The contractual maturities of these deposits follow.       
    Time CDs and other time deposits issued by foreign offices with a denomination of $100,000 or more were
$13.6 billion and $16.7 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      Demand deposit overdrafts of
$649 million and $557 million were included as loan balances at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   

175   

Note 12: Short-Term Borrowings    

The table below shows selected information for short-term borrowings, which generally mature in less than
30 days.   

N/A   Not Applicable   

176   

Note 13: Long-Term Debt    

As a part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy, we often use derivatives to manage
interest rate risk. As a result, much of the long-term debt presented below is hedged in a fair value or cash flow hedge relationship. See Note 16 for further information on qualifying hedge contracts.

Following is a summary of our long-term debt, reflecting unamortized debt discounts and
premiums, and purchase accounting adjustments for debt assumed in the Wachovia acquisition, where applicable:   

(continued on following page)       
         177   

(continued from previous page)         

(1)  
  On March 30, 2009, Wells Fargo issued $1.75 billion of 2.125% fixed senior unsecured notes and $1.75 billion of floating senior unsecured notes both maturing on
June 15, 2012. These notes are guaranteed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s (FDIC) Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.     

(2)  
  Primarily consists of long-term notes where the performance of the note is linked to an embedded equity, commodity, or currency index, or basket of indices accounted for
separately from the note as a free-standing derivative. For information on embedded derivatives, see Note 16   Free-standing derivatives.     

(3)  
  Represents junior subordinated debentures held by unconsolidated wholly owned trusts formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. See Note 8 for additional
information on our trust preferred security structures.     

We participated in the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). The TLGP
had two components: the Debt Guarantee Program, which provided a temporary guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by eligible entities; and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, which provided a temporary unlimited guarantee of
funds in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at FDIC-insured institutions. We opted out of the TLGP effective January 1, 2010.      The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt obligations (based on final maturity dates) as of December 31, 2011, are presented in the following table.   

The interest rates on floating-rate notes are determined periodically by formulas based
on certain money market rates, subject, on certain notes, to minimum or maximum interest rates.      As part of our long-term and
short-term borrowing arrangements, we are subject to various financial and operational covenants. Some of the agreements under which debt has been issued have provisions that may limit the merger or sale of certain subsidiary banks and the issuance
of capital stock or convertible securities by certain subsidiary banks. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all the covenants.

178   

Note 14: Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral    

Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an
event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities lending and other indemnifications, liquidity agreements,

written put options, recourse obligations, residual value guarantees, and contingent consideration. The following table shows carrying value, maximum exposure to loss on our guarantees and the
amount with a higher risk of performance.   

(1)  
  We commenced divestiture of our securities lending business in the latter half of 2011.     

(2)  
  Certain of these agreements included in this table are related to off-balance sheet entities and, accordingly, are also disclosed in Note 8.     

(3)  
  Written put options, which are in the form of derivatives, are also included in the derivative disclosures in Note 16.     

Maximum exposure to loss  and  Non-investment grade  are required
disclosures under GAAP. Non-investment grade represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the guarantee. If the underlying assets under the guarantee are non-investment grade (that is, an
external rating that is below investment grade or an internal credit default grade that is equivalent to a below investment grade external rating), we consider the risk of performance to be high. Internal credit default grades are determined based
upon the same credit policies that we use to evaluate the risk of payment or performance when making loans and other extensions of credit. These credit policies are further described in Note 6.   
  Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite what
we believe is its extremely remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this required disclosure is not
an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value, which is either fair value for derivative related products or the allowance for lending related commitments, is more representative of our exposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss.
      STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT   We issue standby letters of credit, which include performance and financial guarantees, for
customers in connection with contracts between our customers and third parties. Standby letters of credit are agreements where we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a customer in the event the customer fails to meet their
contractual obligations. We consider the credit risk in standby

letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of credit in determining the allowance for credit losses.       SECURITIES LENDING AND OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS   As a securities lending agent, we lend securities from participating institutional clients  portfolios to third-party borrowers. We
indemnify our clients against default by the borrower in returning these lent securities. This indemnity is supported by collateral received from the borrowers. Collateral is generally in the form of cash or highly liquid securities that are marked
to market daily. There was $687 million at December 31, 2011, and $14.0 billion at December 31, 2010, in collateral supporting loaned securities with values of $669 million and $13.6 billion, respectively.   
  We enter into other types of indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business under which we agree to indemnify third
parties against any damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us. These relationships or transactions include those arising from service as a director or
officer of the Company, underwriting agreements relating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various other business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the
occurrence of future events, we are unable to determine our potential future liability under these agreements. We do, however, record a liability for residential mortgage loans that we may have to repurchase pursuant to various representations and
warranties. See Note 1 and Note 9 for additional information on the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses.   

179   

LIQUIDITY AGREEMENTS   We provide liquidity facilities on all commercial paper issued by
the conduit we administer. We also provide liquidity to certain off-balance sheet entities that hold securitized fixed-rate municipal bonds and consumer or commercial assets that are partially funded with the issuance of money market and other
short-term notes. See Note 8 for additional information on these arrangements.       WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS   Written put options are
contracts that give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price, and include options, floors, caps and credit default swaps. These written put option contracts generally permit net
settlement. While these derivative transactions expose us to risk in the event the option is exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument. We offset substantially all put
options written to customers with purchased options. Additionally, for certain of these contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under written put options
is based on future market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. See Note 8 for additional information regarding transactions with VIEs and Note 16 for additional information regarding written derivative contracts.   
   LOANS AND MHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE   In certain loan sales or securitizations, we provide recourse to the buyer whereby we are required to
indemnify the buyer for any loss on the loan up to par value plus accrued interest. We provide recourse, predominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. Primarily all of these programs and arrangements require that
we share in the loans  credit exposure for their remaining life by providing recourse to the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata basis, in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs and
arrangements, if certain events occur within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss
reported in the accompanying table represents the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss
of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale of collateral. In 2011, we repurchased $38 million of loans associated with these agreements. We also provide
representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these guarantees is separately considered and provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for
loan repurchases due to breaches of representations and warranties. See Note 9 for additional information on the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses.       RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES   We have provided residual value guarantees as part of certain leasing transactions of corporate assets. At December 31, 2011, the only remaining residual
value guarantee is related to a leasing transaction on

certain corporate buildings. The lessors in these leases are generally large financial institutions or their leasing subsidiaries. These guarantees protect the lessor from loss on sale of the
related asset at the end of the lease term. To the extent that a sale of the leased assets results in proceeds less than a stated percent (generally 80% to 89%) of the asset s cost, we would be required to reimburse the lessor under our
guarantee.       CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION   In connection with certain brokerage, asset management, insurance agency and other
acquisitions we have made, the terms of the acquisition agreements provide for deferred payments or additional consideration, based on certain performance targets.      We have entered into various contingent performance guarantees through credit risk participation arrangements. Under these agreements, if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain
credit agreements with third parties, we will be required to make payments to the third parties.       Pledged Assets and Collateral
      As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge assets to secure trust and public deposits, borrowings from the FHLB and FRB and
for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The following table provides pledged loans and securities available for sale where the secured party does not have the right to sell or repledge the collateral. At December 31, 2011 and 2010,
we did not pledge any loans or securities available for sale where the secured party has the right to sell or repledge the collateral. The table excludes pledged assets related to VIEs, which can only be used to settle the liabilities of those
entities. See Note 8 for additional information on consolidated VIE assets.       
    We also pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize repurchase agreements and
other securities financings. The types of collateral we pledge include securities issued by federal agencies, government-sponsored entities (GSEs), and domestic and foreign companies. We pledged $20.8 billion at December 31, 2011, and
$27.3 billion at December 31, 2010, under agreements that permit the secured parties to sell or repledge the collateral. Pledged collateral where the secured party cannot sell or repledge was $2.8 billion and $5.9 billion at the
same period ends, respectively.      We receive collateral from other entities under resale agreements and securities borrowings.
We received $17.8 billion at December 31, 2011, and $22.5 billion at December 31, 2010, for which we have the right to sell or repledge the collateral. These amounts include securities we have sold or repledged to others with a
fair value of $16.7 billion at December 31, 2011, and $14.6 billion at December 31, 2010.

Note 15: Legal Actions    

Wells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business activities. These proceedings include actions brought against Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate related matters and transactions in which
Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to provide information or otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct of investigations of other persons or industry
groups.      Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries have generally
denied, or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny, liability in all significant litigation pending against us, including the matters described below, and we intend to defend vigorously each case, other than matters we describe as having
settled. Reserves are established for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts
reserved for those claims.       ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL LITIGATION  On July 31, 2009, the Attorney General for the State of Illinois
filed a civil lawsuit against Wells Fargo   Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Financial Illinois, Inc. in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois. The Illinois Attorney General alleges that the Wells Fargo defendants
engaged in illegal discrimination by  reverse redlining  and by steering African-American and Latino customers into high cost, subprime mortgage loans while other borrowers with similar incomes received lower cost mortgages. Illinois also
alleges that Wells Fargo Financial Illinois, Inc. misled Illinois customers about the terms of mortgage loans. Illinois  complaint against all Wells Fargo defendants is based on alleged violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act and the
Illinois Fairness in Lending Act. The complaint also alleges that Wells Fargo Financial Illinois, Inc. violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act and the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Illinois 
complaint seeks an injunction against the defendants  alleged violation of these Illinois statutes, restitution to consumers and civil money penalties. On October 26, 2011, the Illinois Court issued an order granting, in part, and denying,
in part, Wells Fargo s motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed Wells Fargo   Company as a party and dismissed Count III of the complaint, which alleged violations of the Illinois Fair Lending Act. The Court denied the remainder of the
motion to dismiss.       INTERCHANGE LITIGATION  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo   Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Wachovia
Corporation are named as defendants, separately or in combination, in putative class actions filed on behalf of a plaintiff class of merchants and in individual actions brought by individual merchants with regard to the interchange fees associated
with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. These actions have been consolidated in the United States

District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Visa, MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies are named as defendants in various of these actions. The amended and
consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks damages, as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard and payment card issuing banks
unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with
other defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the Interchange Litigation.  
   MEDICAL CAPITAL CORPORATION LITIGATION  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. served as indenture trustee for debt issued by affiliates of Medical Capital
Corporation, which was placed in receivership at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August 2009. Since September 2009, Wells Fargo has been named as a defendant in various class and mass actions brought by holders of
Medical Capital Corporation s debt, alleging that Wells Fargo breached contractual and other legal obligations owed to them and seeking unspecified damages. The actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California. On July 26, 2011, the District Court certified a class consisting of holders of notes issued by affiliates of Medical Capital Corporation and, on October 18, 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied a
petition seeking to appeal the class certification order.       MORTGAGE-BACKED CERTIFICATES LITIGATION  Several securities law based
putative class actions were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on July 16, 2009, under the caption  In re Wells Fargo Mortgage-Backed Certificates Litigation . The case asserted claims against
several Wells Fargo mortgage backed securities trusts, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and other affiliated entities, individual employee defendants, along with various underwriters and rating agencies. The plaintiffs alleged that the offering documents
contain untrue statements of material fact, or omit to state material facts necessary to make the registration statements and accompanying prospectuses not misleading. The parties agreed to settle the case on May 27, 2011, for
$125 million. Final approval of the settlement was entered on November 14, 2011. Some class members opted out of the settlement, with the most significant being the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and American International Group, Inc.      On June 29, 2010, and on July 15, 2010,
two complaints, the first captioned  The Charles Schwab Corporation vs. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith, Inc., et al.,  and the second captioned  The Charles Schwab Corporation v. BNP Paribas 

181   

Securities Corp., et al.,  were filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, San
Francisco County against a number of defendants, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation. As against the Wells Fargo entities, the new cases assert opt out claims relating to the claims alleged in the
Mortgage-Backed Certificates Litigation.      On October 15, 2010, three actions, captioned    Federal Home Loan Bank
of Chicago v. Banc of America Funding Corporation, et al.  (filed in the Cook County Circuit Court, State of Illinois);  Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago v. Banc of America Securities LLC, et al.  (filed in the Superior Court of the State
of California for the County of Los Angeles); and  Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis v. Banc of America Mortgage   America Securities, Inc., et al.  (filed in the Superior Court of the State of Indiana for the County of Marion), named
multiple defendants, described as issuers/depositors, and underwriters/dealers of private label mortgage-backed securities, in an action asserting claims that defendants used false and misleading statements in offering documents for the sale of such
securities. The Bank of Chicago asserts that it purchased approximately $4.2 billion and the Bank of Indianapolis asserts that it purchased nearly $3 billion of such securities from the defendants. Plaintiffs seek rescission of the sales and damages
under state securities and other laws and Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933. Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo   Company were named among the defendants.   
  On April 20, 2011, a case captioned  Federal Home Loan of Boston v. Ally Financial, Inc., et al. , was filed in the Superior
Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the County of Suffolk. The case names, among a large number of parties, Wells Fargo   Company, Wells Fargo Asset Securitization Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as parties and contains
allegations substantially similar to the cases filed by the other Federal Home Loan Banks.      On April 28, 2011, a case
captioned  The Union Central Life Insurance Company, et al. v. Credit Suisse First Boston Securities Corp., et al.,  was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Among other defendants, it names Wells Fargo Asset
Securitization Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The case asserts various state law fraud claims and claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of three insurance companies, relating to
offerings of mortgage-backed securities from 2005 through 2007.      In addition, there are other mortgage-related threatened or
asserted claims by entities or investors where Wells Fargo may have indemnity or repurchase obligations, or as to which it has entered into agreements to toll the relevant statutes of limitations.   
   MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE DOCUMENT LITIGATION  Eight purported class actions and several individual borrower actions related to foreclosure document
practices were filed in late 2010 and in early 2011 against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in its status as mortgage servicer or corporate trustee of mortgage trusts. The cases have been brought in state and federal courts. Five of the class actions have
been dismissed or otherwise resolved. Of the individual borrower cases, the majority are filed in state courts in California and Ohio. The actions generally claim that Wells Fargo submitted  fraudulent  or  untruthful  affidavits
or other foreclosure documents to courts to support foreclosures filed in the state. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo signers did not have personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the documents and did not verify the information in
the documents ultimately filed with courts to foreclose. Plaintiffs attempt to state legal claims ranging from wrongful foreclosure to deceptive practices or fraud and seek relief ranging from cancellation of notes and mortgages to money damages.

MORTGAGE RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS  On April 13, 2011, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered
into a Consent Order with the OCC and Wells Fargo   Company entered into a Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in connection with Wells Fargo s mortgage foreclosure practices. The Consent Orders
require Wells Fargo to develop and implement certain compliance programs and to take other remedial steps, which Wells Fargo is doing. On February 9, 2012, the OCC and Federal Reserve announced that they had also imposed civil money penalties
of $83 million and $85 million, respectively, related to the Consent Orders. These penalties will be satisfied through payments made under a separate simultaneous settlement in principle, announced on the same day, among the Department of Justice
(DOJ), a task force of Attorneys General from 49 states, other government entities, Wells Fargo and four other mortgage servicers related to mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices. Under the settlement in principle, Wells Fargo agreed to the
following commitments, comprised of three components totaling $5.3 billion:   

Consumer Relief Program  For qualified borrowers with financial hardship and a loan owned and serviced by Wells Fargo, a commitment to provide
$3.4 billion in aggregate consumer relief and assistance programs, including expanded first and second mortgage modifications that broaden the use of principal reduction to help customers achieve affordability, an expanded short sale program that
includes waivers of deficiency balances, forgiveness of arrearages for unemployed borrowers, cash-for-keys payments to borrowers who voluntarily vacate properties, and  anti-blight  provisions designed to reduce the impact on communities
of vacant properties. As of December 31, 2011, the expected impact of the Consumer Relief Program was covered in our allowance for credit losses and in the nonaccretable difference relating to our purchased credit-impaired residential mortgage
portfolio.      

Refinance Program  For qualified borrowers with little or negative equity in their home and a loan owned and serviced by Wells Fargo, an expanded
first-lien refinance program commitment estimated to provide $900 million of aggregate payment relief over the life of the refinanced loans. The Refinance Program will not result in any current-period charge as its impact will be recognized over a
period of years in the form of lower interest income as qualified borrowers benefit from reduced interest rates on loans refinanced under the program.      

Foreclosure Assistance Payment  $1 billion paid directly to the federal government and the participating states for their use to address the
impact of foreclosure challenges as they see fit and which may include direct payments to consumers. As of December 31, 2011, we had fully accrued for the Foreclosure Assistance Payment.      
  Government agencies continue investigations or examinations of other mortgage related practices of Wells Fargo. The investigations relate to two main
topics, (1) whether Wells Fargo may have violated fair lending or other laws and regulations relating to mortgage origination practices; and (2) whether Wells Fargo properly disclosed in offering documents for its residential
mortgage-backed securities the facts and risks associated with those securities. Wells Fargo has received a Wells notice from SEC staff relating to Wells Fargo s disclosures in mortgage-backed securities offering documents. Wells Fargo
continues to provide information requested by the various agencies in connection with certain investigations.

Note 15: Legal Actions      (continued)       

MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES BID PRACTICES INVESTIGATION  The DOJ and the SEC, beginning in November 2006,
requested information from a number of financial institutions, including Wachovia Bank, N.A. s municipal derivatives group, with regard to competitive bid practices in the municipal derivative markets. Other state and federal agencies
subsequently also began investigations of the same practices. On December 8, 2011, a global resolution of the Wachovia Bank investigations was announced by DOJ, the Internal Revenue Service, the SEC, the OCC and a group of State Attorneys
General. The investigations were settled with Wachovia Bank agreeing to pay a total of approximately $148 million in penalties and remediation to the various agencies.      Wachovia Bank, along with a number of other banks and financial services companies, was named as a defendant in a number of substantially identical purported class actions and individual actions filed in
various state and federal courts by various municipalities alleging they have been damaged by the activity which is the subject of the government investigations. These cases were either consolidated under the caption  In re Municipal Derivatives
Antitrust Litigation  or administered jointly with that action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs and Wells Fargo agreed to settle the  In re Municipal Derivatives Antitrust Litigation  on
October 21, 2011. The settlement is subject to court approval and, if finally approved, will result in Wells Fargo paying the amount of $37 million. The settlement was preliminarily approved on December 27, 2011.   
   ORDER OF POSTING LITIGATION  A series of putative class actions have been filed against Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as
many other banks, challenging the high to low order in which the Banks post debit card transactions to consumer deposit accounts. There are currently several such cases pending against Wells Fargo Bank (including the Wachovia Bank cases to which
Wells Fargo succeeded), most of which have been consolidated in multi-district litigation proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The bank defendants moved to compel these cases to arbitration under recent
Supreme Court authority. On November 22, 2011, the Judge denied the motion. The Banks have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.      On August 10, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order in  Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , a case that was not consolidated in the
multi-district proceedings, enjoining the Bank s use of the high to low posting method for debit card transactions with respect to the plaintiff class of California depositors, directing that the Bank establish a different posting methodology
and ordering remediation of approximately $203 million. On October 26, 2010, a final judgment was entered in Gutierrez. On October 28, 2010, Wells Fargo appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

WACHOVIA EQUITY SECURITIES AND BONDS/NOTES LITIGATION  A securities class action, now captioned  In
re Wachovia Equity Securities Litigation,  has been pending under various names since July 7, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Among other allegations, plaintiffs allege Wachovia s common stock price was artificially inflated as a result of allegedly misleading disclosures relating to the Golden West Financial Corp. mortgage portfolio, Wachovia s
exposure to other mortgage related products such as CDOs, control issues and auction rate securities. There are four additional cases (not class actions) containing allegations similar to the allegations in the  In re Wachovia Equity Securities
Litigation  captioned  Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Wachovia Corp. et al., FC Holdings AB, et al. v. Wachovia Corp., et al., Deka Investment GmbH v. Wachovia Corp. et al. and Forsta AP-Fonden v. Wachovia Corp., et al. , respectively, which
were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 31, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a Decision and Order granting Wachovia s motions to dismiss the  In re
Wachovia Equity Securities Litigation  and the  Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, FC Holdings AB, Deka Investment GmbH  and  Forsta AP-Fonden  cases. Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo have agreed to settle the  Equity Securities Litigation
 for $75 million and on January 27, 2012, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement. A fairness hearing on final approval of the settlement is scheduled for June 1, 2012.   
  After a number of procedural motions, three purported class action cases alleging violations of Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 as a result of allegedly misleading disclosures relating to the Golden West mortgage portfolio in connection with Wachovia s issuance of various preferred securities and bonds were transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York. A consolidated class action complaint was filed on September 4, 2009, and the matter was captioned  In Re Wachovia Preferred Securities and Bond/Notes Litigation . On March 31, 2011, by the same
Decision and Order referenced above, the court also granted in part and denied in part Wachovia s motion to dismiss the  In re Wachovia Preferred Securities and Bond/Notes Litigation , allowing that case to go forward after limiting the
number of offerings at issue. Wells Fargo and the plaintiffs agreed to settle the  In re Wachovia Preferred Securities and Bond/Notes Litigation  for $590 million. The proposed settlement was preliminarily approved by the Court on
August 9, 2011. The hearing on final approval was held on November 14, 2011, and a judgment approving class action settlements was filed on January 3, 2012.   
  There are a number of other similar actions filed in state courts in North Carolina and South Carolina by individual shareholders. Two
of the individual shareholder actions in South Carolina have been dismissed and the shareholders have appealed. On December 22, 2011, the dismissal of th  e    Rivers v. Wachovia Corporation, et al . case, one of the two South
Carolina actions, was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.   

183   

OUTLOOK  When establishing a liability for contingent litigation losses, the Company determines a
range of potential losses for each matter that is both probable and estimable, and records the amount it considers to be the best estimate within the range. The high end of the range of reasonably possible potential litigation losses in excess of
the Company s liability for probable and estimable losses was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2011. For these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of possible losses
in excess of the established liability that cannot be   

estimated. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions
against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo s consolidated financial position. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo s results of operations for any particular period.

Note
16: Derivatives            

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency
risk, to generate profits from proprietary trading and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not,
when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined.   
  Our asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of derivatives. Such
derivatives are typically designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedge derivatives for those that do not qualify for hedge accounting. This helps minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair values of assets and
liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other market value volatility. This approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, foreign
currency and other exposures do not have a significantly adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and earnings. As a result of fluctuations in these exposures, hedged assets and liabilities will gain or lose market value. In a fair
value or economic hedge, the effect of this unrealized gain or loss will generally be offset by the gain or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we manage the variability of cash payments
due to interest rate fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged assets and liabilities, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives or the hedged asset or liability is generally not reflected in earnings.

We also offer various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and
foreign exchange contracts, to our customers but usually offset our exposure from such contracts by purchasing other financial contracts. The customer accommodations and any offsetting financial contracts are treated as free-standing derivatives.
Free-standing derivatives also include derivatives we enter into for risk management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting, including economic hedge derivatives. To a lesser extent, we take positions based on market expectations or to
benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets. Additionally, free-standing derivatives include embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contracts.   
  The following table presents the total notional or contractual amounts and fair values for derivatives designated as qualifying hedge
contracts, which are used as asset/liability management hedges, and free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) not designated as hedging instruments that are recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities. Customer
accommodation, trading and other free-standing derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in trading assets or other liabilities.

  Includes free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, MHFS, and other interests held.

(3)  
  Represents netting of derivative asset and liability balances, and related cash collateral, with the same counterparty subject to master netting arrangements. The amount of cash
collateral netted against derivative assets and liabilities was $6.6 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and $5.5 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010.     
         185   

Fair Value Hedges       We use interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and CDs to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps,
cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. In addition, we use interest rate swaps and
forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in fair
value for certain mortgages held for sale. The entire derivative gain or loss is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge relationships, except for those involving foreign-currency denominated securities available
for sale and long-term debt hedged with foreign currency forward derivatives for which

the component of the derivative gain or loss related to the changes in the difference between the spot and forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.   
  We use statistical regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing
basis. The regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The assessment
includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness.      The following table shows the net gains (losses) recognized in the income statement related to derivatives in fair value hedging relationships.

(1)  
  Included $53 million and $3 million, respectively, for year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, of gains (losses) on forward derivatives hedging foreign currency securities
available for sale and long-term debt, representing the portion of derivatives gains (losses) excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (time value).     
         186   

Note 16: Derivatives    (continued)       

Cash Flow Hedges       We hedge floating-rate debt against future interest rate increases by using interest rate swaps, caps, floors and futures to limit variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.
We also use interest rate swaps and floors to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans, due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Gains and losses on derivatives that are reclassified from
OCI to interest income and interest expense in the current period are included in the line item in which the hedged item s effect on earnings is recorded. All parts of gain or loss on these derivatives are included in the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. The regression analysis involves regressing the periodic changes in cash flows of the hedging instrument
against the periodic

changes in cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The assessment includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures of the regression results
used to validate the conclusion of high effectiveness.      Based upon current interest rates, we estimate that $440 million
(pre-tax) of deferred net gains on derivatives in OCI at December 31, 2011, will be reclassified into interest income and interest expense during the next twelve months. Future changes to interest rates may significantly change actual amounts
reclassified to earnings. We are hedging our exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of 6 years for both hedges of floating-rate debt and floating-rate commercial loans.   
  The following table shows the net gains (losses) recognized related to derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships.

(1)  
  None of the change in value of the derivatives was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.     

Free-Standing Derivatives       We use free-standing derivatives (economic hedges), in addition to debt securities available for sale, to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs measured at fair value, certain
residential MHFS, derivative loan commitments and other interests held. The resulting gain or loss on these economic hedges is reflected in other income.      The derivatives used to hedge these MSRs measured at fair value, which include swaps, swaptions, constant maturity mortgages, forwards, Eurodollar and Treasury futures and options contracts, resulted in
net derivative gains of $5.2 billion in 2011 and net derivative gains of $4.5 billion in of 2010, which are included in mortgage banking noninterest income. The aggregate fair value of these derivatives was a net asset of $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2011, and a net liability of $943 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in fair value of debt securities available for sale (unrealized gains and losses) are not included in servicing income, but are reported in
cumulative OCI (net of tax) or, upon sale, are reported in net gains (losses) on debt securities available for sale.   
  Interest rate lock commitments for residential mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free-standing derivatives. Our
interest rate exposure on these derivative loan commitments, as well as substantially all residential MHFS, is hedged with free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) such as swaps, forwards and options, Eurodollar futures and options, and Treasury
futures, forwards and options contracts. The commitments, free-standing derivatives and residential MHFS are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in mortgage banking noninterest income. For the fair value measurement of interest
rate lock commitments we include, at inception and during the life of the loan commitment, the

expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan. Fair value changes subsequent to inception are based on changes in fair value of the underlying loan resulting from
the exercise of the commitment and changes in the probability that the loan will not fund within the terms of the commitment (referred to as a fall-out factor). The value of the underlying loan is affected primarily by changes in interest rates and
the passage of time. However, changes in investor demand can also cause changes in the value of the underlying loan value that cannot be hedged. The aggregate fair value of derivative loan commitments in the balance sheet was a net asset of $478
million at December 31, 2011, and a net liability of $271 million at December 31, 2010, and is included in the caption  Interest rate contracts  under  Customer accommodation, trading and other free-standing
derivatives  in the first table in this Note.      We also enter into various derivatives primarily to provide derivative
products to customers. To a lesser extent, we take positions based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets. These derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities in the
balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter into free-standing derivatives for risk management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as other noninterest income.      Free-standing derivatives
also include embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from their host contract. We periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and CDs where the performance of the hybrid instrument notes is linked to an equity, commodity
or currency index, or basket of such indices. These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all   

187   

of the cash flows or the value of the note in a manner similar to a derivative instrument and therefore are
considered to contain an  embedded  derivative instrument. The indices on which the performance of the hybrid instrument is calculated are not clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The  embedded  derivative is
separated from the host contract and accounted for as a free-standing derivative. Additionally, we may invest in hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives,

such as credit derivatives, that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract. In such instances, we either elect fair value option for the hybrid instrument or separate the embedded
derivative from the host contract and account for the host contract and derivative separately.      The following table shows the
net gains recognized in the income statement related to derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.   

(1)  
  Predominantly mortgage banking noninterest income including gains (losses) on the derivatives used as economic hedges of MSRs measured at fair value, interest rate lock
commitments and mortgages held for sale.     

(2)  
  Predominantly included in other noninterest income.     

(3)  
  Predominantly mortgage banking noninterest income including gains (losses) on interest rate lock commitments.     

(4)  
  Predominantly included in net gains from trading activities in noninterest income.     

Credit Derivatives       We use credit derivatives primarily to assist customers with their risk management objectives. We may also use credit derivatives in structured product transactions or liquidity agreements written to
special purpose vehicles. The maximum exposure of sold credit derivatives is managed through posted collateral, purchased credit derivatives and similar products in order to achieve our desired credit risk profile. This credit risk management
provides an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that would be paid under the sold credit derivatives. We would be required to perform under the noted credit derivatives in the event of default by the referenced obligors. Events
of default include events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest payment. In certain cases, other triggers may exist, such as the credit downgrade of the referenced obligors or the inability of the special
purpose vehicle for which we have provided liquidity to obtain funding.

derivatives.       

Protection sold represents the estimated maximum exposure to loss that would be incurred
under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. We believe this hypothetical circumstance to be an
extremely remote possibility and accordingly, this required disclosure is not an indication of expected loss. The amounts under non-investment grade represent the notional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being
required to perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets.

We consider the risk of performance to be high if the underlying assets under the credit
derivative have an external rating that is below investment grade or an internal credit default grade that is equivalent thereto. We believe the net protection sold, which is representative of the net notional amount of protection sold and purchased
with identical underlyings, in combination with other protection purchased, is more representative of our exposure to loss than either non-investment grade or protection sold. Other protection purchased represents additional protection, which may
offset the exposure to loss for protection sold, that was not purchased with an identical underlying of the protection sold.

189   

Credit-Risk Contingent Features       Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if the credit rating of our debt, based on certain major credit rating agencies indicated in the relevant contracts, were to fall below
investment grade, the counterparty could demand additional collateral or require termination or replacement of derivative instruments in a net liability position. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related
contingent features that are in a net liability position was $17.1 billion and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for which we had posted $15.0 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively, in collateral in the normal course
of business. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2011 or 2010, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $2.1 billion, or $1.0 billion, respectively,
or potentially settle the contract in an amount equal to its fair value.

Counterparty Credit Risk       By using derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk if counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty credit risk
is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject to master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a
loss position with the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate.
To the extent the master netting arrangements and other criteria meet the applicable requirements, derivatives balances and related cash collateral amounts are shown net in the balance sheet. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is
considered in determining fair value and our assessment of hedge effectiveness.   

Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities      

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to
determine fair value disclosures. Trading assets, securities available for sale, derivatives, substantially all prime residential MHFS, certain commercial LHFS, certain loans held for investment, fair value MSRs, principal investments and securities
sold but not yet purchased (short sale liabilities) are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We generally do not record our issued debt at fair value. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other assets
on a nonrecurring basis, such as certain residential and commercial MHFS, certain LHFS, loans held for investment and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting
or write-downs of individual assets.      We adopted new guidance on fair value measurements effective January 1, 2009,
which addresses measuring fair value in situations where markets are inactive and transactions are not orderly. This guidance states transaction or quoted prices for assets or liabilities in inactive markets may require adjustment due to the
uncertainty of whether the underlying transactions are orderly. Prior to our adoption of the new provisions for measuring fair value, we primarily used unadjusted independent vendor or broker quoted prices to measure fair value for substantially all
securities available for sale.      In connection with the change in guidance for fair value measurement, we developed policies
and procedures to determine when the level and volume of activity for our assets and liabilities requiring fair value measurements has significantly declined relative to normal conditions. For such items that use price quotes, such as certain
security classes within securities available for sale, the degree of market inactivity and distressed transactions was analyzed to determine the appropriate adjustment to the price quotes.   
  The security classes where we consider the market to be less orderly include primarily non-agency residential MBS. The methodology used
to adjust the quotes involved weighting the

price quotes and results of internal pricing techniques such as the net present value of future expected cash flows (with observable inputs, where available) discounted at a rate of return market
participants require. The significant inputs utilized in the internal pricing techniques, which were estimated by type of underlying collateral, included credit loss assumptions, estimated prepayment speeds and appropriate discount rates.
     The more active and orderly markets for particular security classes were determined to be, the more weighting we assigned to
price quotes. The less active and orderly markets were determined to be, the less weighting we assigned to price quotes. We continually assess the level and volume of market activity in our investment security classes in determining adjustments, if
any, to price quotes. Given market conditions can change over time, determination of which securities markets are considered active or inactive, and if inactive, the degree to which price quotes require adjustment, can also change.   
   Fair Value Hierarchy       We group our
assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:   

Level 1   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.      

Level 2   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.      

Level 3   Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable
assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.

190   

Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities    (continued)       

In the determination of the classification of financial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3
of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. For securities in
inactive markets, we use a predetermined percentage to evaluate the impact of fair value adjustments derived from weighting both external and internal indications of value to determine if the instrument is classified as Level 2 or Level 3. Based
upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments  fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are
considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3.       Determination of Fair Value    
  We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements.      In instances where there is limited or no observable market data, fair value measurements for assets and liabilities are based primarily upon our own estimates or combination of our own estimates and
independent vendor or broker pricing, and the measurements are often calculated based on current pricing for products we offer or issue, the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other such factors.
As with any valuation technique used to estimate fair value, changes in underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values. Accordingly, these
fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability.      We incorporate
lack of liquidity into our fair value measurement based on the type of asset or liability measured and the valuation methodology used. For example, for certain residential MHFS and certain securities where the significant inputs have become
unobservable due to illiquid markets and vendor or broker pricing is not used, we use a discounted cash flow technique to measure fair value. This technique incorporates forecasting of expected cash flows (adjusted for credit loss assumptions and
estimated prepayment speeds) discounted at an appropriate market discount rate to reflect the lack of liquidity in the market that a market participant would consider. For other securities where vendor or broker pricing is used, we use either
unadjusted broker quotes or vendor prices or vendor or broker prices adjusted by weighting them with internal discounted cash flow techniques to measure fair value. These unadjusted vendor or broker prices inherently reflect any lack of liquidity in
the market as the fair value measurement represents an exit price from a market participant viewpoint.      Following are
descriptions of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a

recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value.       Assets        SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS  Short-term financial assets include cash and due
from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements and due from customers on acceptances. These assets are carried at historical cost. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively
short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization.       TRADING ASSETS (EXCLUDING DERIVATIVES) AND SECURITIES
AVAILABLE FOR SALE  Trading assets and securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices in active markets, if available. Such instruments are classified within Level
1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include exchange-traded equity securities and some highly liquid government securities such as U.S. Treasuries. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such
securities, we generally rely on internal valuation techniques or on prices obtained from independent pricing services or brokers (collectively, vendors) or combination thereof.   
  Trading securities are mostly valued using trader prices that are subject to internal price verification procedures. The majority of
fair values derived using internal valuation techniques are verified against multiple pricing sources, including prices obtained from independent vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources and often apply matrix pricing for similar
securities when no price is observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by the vendors in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. When we evaluate the appropriateness of an internal
trader price compared with vendor prices, our considerations include the range and quality of vendor prices. Vendor prices are used to ensure the reasonableness of a trader price; however valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired
from knowledge of a particular market and is not perfunctory. If a trader asserts that a vendor price is not reflective of market value, justification for using the trader price, including recent sales activity where possible, must be provided to
and approved by the appropriate levels of management.      Similarly, while securities available for sale traded in secondary
markets are typically valued using unadjusted vendor prices or vendor prices adjusted by weighting them with internal discounted cash flow techniques, these prices are reviewed and, if deemed inappropriate by a trader who has the most knowledge of a
particular market, can be adjusted. Securities measured with these internal valuation techniques are generally classified as Level 2 of the hierarchy and often involve using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models, discounted
cash flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the market where available or combination of multiple valuation techniques. Examples include certain residential and commercial MBS, municipal bonds, U.S. government and agency MBS, and
corporate debt securities.   

191   

Security fair value measurements using significant inputs that are unobservable in the
market due to limited activity or a less liquid market are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Such measurements include securities valued using internal models or a combination of multiple valuation techniques such as weighting of
internal models and vendor or broker pricing, where the unobservable inputs are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Securities classified as Level 3 include certain residential and commercial MBS, asset-backed securities
collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash reserves, CDOs and CLOs, and certain residual and retained interests in residential mortgage loan securitizations. CDOs are valued using the prices of similar instruments, the pricing of completed or
pending third party transactions or the pricing of the underlying collateral within the CDO. Where vendor or broker prices are not readily available, management s best estimate is used.       MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE (MHFS)  We carry substantially all of our residential MHFS portfolio at fair value. Fair value is based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices
for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. As necessary, these prices are adjusted for typical securitization activities, including servicing value, portfolio composition, market conditions and liquidity. Most of our MHFS are
classified as Level 2. For the portion where market pricing data is not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value and, accordingly, classify as Level 3.       LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS are carried at the lower of cost or market value, or at fair value. The fair value of LHFS is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios
with similar characteristics. As such, we classify those loans subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2.       LOANS 
For the carrying value of loans, including PCI loans, see Note 1. Although most loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, reverse mortgages, which were previously sold under a GNMA securitization program and were consolidated during
fourth quarter 2011, are held at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to loans to reflect partial write-downs that are based on the observable market price of the loan or current appraised value
of the collateral.      We provide fair value estimates in this disclosure for loans that are not recorded at fair value on a
recurring or nonrecurring basis. Those estimates differentiate loans based on their financial characteristics, such as product classification, loan category, pricing features and remaining maturity. Prepayment and credit loss estimates are evaluated
by product and loan rate.      The fair value of commercial loans is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows, adjusted
for credit loss estimates, using discount rates that reflect our current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity.

For real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages, fair value is calculated by
discounting contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayment and credit loss estimates, using discount rates based on current industry pricing (where readily available) or our own estimate of an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for loans of
similar size, type, remaining maturity and repricing characteristics.      The carrying value of credit card loans, which is
adjusted for estimates of credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date, is reported as a reasonable estimate of fair value.      For all other consumer loans, the fair value is generally calculated by discounting the contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayment and credit loss estimates, based on the current rates we offer for
loans with similar characteristics.      Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of credit
generate ongoing fees at our current pricing levels, which are recognized over the term of the commitment period. In situations where the credit quality of the counterparty to a commitment has declined, we record an allowance. A reasonable estimate
of the fair value of these instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the related allowance. Certain letters of credit that are hedged with derivative instruments are carried at fair value in trading assets or liabilities. For those
letters of credit fair value is calculated based on readily quotable credit default spreads, using a market risk credit default swap model.   
   DERIVATIVES  Quoted market prices are available and used for our exchange-traded derivatives, such as certain interest rate futures and option
contracts, which we classify as Level 1. However, substantially all of our derivatives are traded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets where quoted market prices are not always readily available. Therefore we value most OTC derivatives using internal
valuation techniques. Valuation techniques and inputs to internally-developed models depend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the derivative s value is based. Key inputs can include yield
curves, credit curves, foreign-exchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements and correlation of such inputs. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not require significant judgment, such derivatives are
typically classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples of derivatives classified as Level 2 include generic interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, commodity swaps, and certain option and forward contracts. When instruments are
traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such derivatives are classified as Level 3. Examples of derivatives classified as Level 3 include complex and highly structured derivatives, certain credit default swaps,
interest rate lock commitments written for our residential mortgage loans that we intend to sell and long dated equity options where volatility is not observable. Additionally, significant judgments are required when classifying financial
instruments within the fair value hierarchy, particularly between Level 2 and 3, as is the case for certain derivatives.   

192   

Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities    (continued)       

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERESTS HELD IN SECURITIZATIONS  MSRs and
certain other interests held in securitizations (e.g., interest-only strips) do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, we determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value
of estimated future net servicing income cash flows. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility),
discount rate, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. Commercial MSRs and certain residential MSRs are carried at lower
of cost or market value, and therefore can be subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. Changes in the fair value of MSRs occur primarily due to the collection/realization of expected cash flows, as well as changes in valuation
inputs and assumptions. For other interests held in securitizations (such as interest-only strips) we use a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows. The model incorporates our own estimates of assumptions
market participants use in determining the fair value, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rates, defaults and contractual fee income. Interest-only strips are recorded as trading assets. Our valuation approach is validated by our
internal valuation model validation group and our valuation estimates are periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. Fair value measurements of our MSRs and interest-only strips use significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, we
classify as Level 3.       FORECLOSED ASSETS  Foreclosed assets are carried at net realizable value, which represents fair value less
estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or appraised values of the collateral and, accordingly, we classify foreclosed assets as Level 2.       NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS  Nonmarketable equity investments are generally recorded under the cost or equity method of accounting. There are generally restrictions on the sale and/or
liquidation of these investments, including federal bank stock. Federal bank stock carrying value approximates fair value. We use facts and circumstances available to estimate the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments. We typically
consider our access to and need for capital (including recent or projected financing activity), qualitative assessments of the viability of the investee, evaluation of the financial statements of the investee and prospects for its future. Public
equity investments are valued using quoted market prices and discounts are only applied when there are trading restrictions that are an attribute of the investment. We estimate the fair value of investments in non-public securities using metrics
such as security prices of comparable public companies, acquisition prices for similar companies and original investment purchase price multiples, while also incorporating a portfolio company s financial performance and specific factors. For
investments in private equity funds, we use the NAV provided by the fund sponsor as an appropriate measure of fair

value. In some cases, such NAVs require adjustments based on certain unobservable inputs.   
   Liabilities        DEPOSIT LIABILITIES 
Deposit liabilities are carried at historical cost. The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing checking, and market rate and other savings, is equal to the amount payable on
demand at the measurement date. The fair value of other time deposits is calculated based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for like wholesale deposits with similar
remaining maturities.       SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  Short-term financial liabilities are carried at historical cost and include
federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of the
instrument and its expected realization.       OTHER LIABILITIES  Other liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding
derivative liabilities (see the   Derivatives   section for derivative liabilities), includes primarily short sale liabilities. Short sale liabilities are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2, generally dependent upon whether the
underlying securities have readily obtainable quoted prices in active exchange markets.       LONG-TERM DEBT  Long-term debt is generally
carried at amortized cost. For disclosure, we are required to estimate the fair value of long-term debt. Generally, the discounted cash flow method is used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt. Contractual cash flows are discounted using
rates currently offered for new notes with similar remaining maturities and, as such, these discount rates include our current spread levels.

193   

Fair Value Measurements from Independent Brokers or Independent Third Party Pricing Services
      For certain assets and liabilities, we obtain fair value measurements from independent brokers or independent third party pricing services
and record the unadjusted fair value in our

financial statements. The detail by level is shown in the table below. Fair value measurements obtained from independent brokers or independent third party pricing services that we have adjusted
to determine the fair value recorded in our financial statements are not included in the following table.

Changes in Fair Value Levels       We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based
valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. The amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred.   
  We evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer
relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we transferred $709 million of other trading assets from Level 2 to Level 1 due to use of more observable market data. We transferred $801
million of debt securities available for sale from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an increase in the volume of trading activity for certain securities, which resulted in increased occurrences of observable market prices. We also transferred $502 million
of securities available for sale from Level 2 to Level 3 primarily due to a decrease in liquidity for certain asset-backed securities.      Significant changes to Level 3 assets for the year ended December 31, 2010 are described as follows:   

We adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which impacted Level 3 balances for certain financial instruments. Reductions in Level 3 balances,
which represent derecognition of existing investments in newly consolidated VIEs, are reflected as transfers out for the following categories: trading assets, $276 million; securities available for sale, $1.9 billion; and mortgage servicing rights,
$118

million. Increases in Level 3 balances, which represent newly consolidated VIE assets, are reflected as transfers in for the following categories: securities available for sale, $829 million;
loans, $366 million; and long-term debt, $359 million.      

We transferred $4.9 billion of securities available for sale from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an increase in the volume of trading activity for certain
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, which resulted in increased occurrences of observable market prices. We also transferred $1.7 billion of debt securities available for sale from Level 2 to Level 3, primarily due to a decrease in
liquidity for certain asset-backed securities.         For the year ended December 31, 2009, we transferred
$4.0 billion of debt securities available for sale from Level 3 to Level 2 due to increased trading activity.       Assets and Liabilities
Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis       We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of LOCOM accounting or write-downs of individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in 2011 and 2010 that were
still held in the balance sheet at each respective year end, the following table provides the fair value hierarchy and the carrying value of the related individual assets or portfolios at year end.

(1)  
  Predominantly real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans measured at LOCOM.

Alternative Investments       The following table summarizes our investments in various types of funds, which are included in trading assets, securities available for sale and other assets. We use the funds  net asset

values (NAVs) per share as a practical expedient to measure fair value on recurring and nonrecurring bases. The fair values presented in the table are based upon the funds  NAVs or an
equivalent measure.   

N/A   Not applicable   

Offshore funds primarily invest in investment grade European fixed-income securities.
Redemption restrictions are in place for investments with a fair value of $200 million and $74 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to lock-up provisions that will remain in effect until October 2015.   
  Private equity funds invest in equity and debt securities issued by private and publicly-held companies in connection with leveraged
buyouts, recapitalizations and expansion opportunities. Substantially all of these investments do not allow redemptions. Alternatively, we receive distributions as the underlying assets of the funds liquidate, which we expect to occur over the next
nine years.      Venture capital funds invest in domestic and foreign companies in a variety of industries, including information
technology, financial services and healthcare. These investments can never be redeemed with the funds. Instead, we receive distributions as the underlying assets of the fund liquidate, which we expect to occur over the next six years.

fair value for prime MHFS originations for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist to reliably support fair value pricing models used for these loans. Loan origination fees on these loans are recognized when
earned, and related direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred. We also measure at fair value certain of our other interests held related to residential loan sales and securitizations. We believe fair value measurement for prime
MHFS and other interests held, which we hedge with free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) along with our MSRs, measured at fair value, reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in
the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets.

Upon the acquisition of Wachovia, we elected to measure at fair value certain portfolios
of LHFS that may be economically hedged with derivative instruments. In addition, we elected to measure at fair value certain letters of credit that are hedged with derivative instruments to better reflect the economics of the transactions. These
letters of credit are included in trading account assets or liabilities.      Upon the adoption of new consolidation guidance on
January 1, 2010, we elected to measure at fair value the eligible assets (loans) and liabilities (long-term debt) of certain nonconforming mortgage loan securitization VIEs. We elected the fair value option for such newly consolidated VIEs to
continue fair value accounting as our interests prior to consolidation were predominantly carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Upon clarifying guidance from the SEC during fourth quarter 2011, we consolidated
reverse mortgage loans previously sold under a GNMA securitization program. We had initially elected fair value option on these loans prior to sale, and, as such, they were consolidated under fair value option.   
  The following table reflects the differences between fair value carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities for which we have
elected the fair value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal amount at maturity.   

203   

(1)  
  The difference between fair value carrying amount and aggregate unpaid principal includes changes in fair value recorded at and subsequent to funding, gains and losses on the
related loan commitment prior to funding, and premiums on acquired loans.     

The assets accounted for under the fair value option are initially measured at fair value. Gains and losses
from initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The changes in fair value related to

initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value included in earnings for these assets measured at fair value are shown, by income statement line item, below.

The following table shows the estimated gains and losses from earnings attributable to
instrument-specific credit risk related to assets accounted for under the fair value option.       
    For performing loans, instrument-specific credit risk gains or losses were derived principally by determining the change
in fair value of the loans due to changes in the observable or implied credit spread. Credit spread is the market yield on the loans less the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. In recent years

spreads have been significantly affected by the lack of liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans. For nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to
instrument-specific credit risk.

Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities    (continued)       

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
  The table below is a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments, excluding short-term financial assets and liabilities because carrying
amounts approximate fair value, and excluding financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts in the following table are recorded in the balance sheet under the indicated captions.

We have not included assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments in our
disclosure, such as the value of the long-term relationships with our deposit, credit card and trust customers, amortized MSRs, premises and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and other liabilities. The total of the fair value
calculations presented does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company.

(1)  
  Balance excludes MHFS for which the fair value option was elected.     

(2)  
  Balance excludes LHFS for which the fair value option was elected.     

(3)  
  Loans exclude balances for which the fair value option was elected. At December 31, 2010, long-term debt excludes balances for which the fair value option was elected. Loans
exclude lease financing with a carrying amount of $13.1 billion at both December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.     

Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of credit
are not included in the table above. A reasonable estimate of the fair value of these instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the related allowance. This amounted to $495 million and $673 million at December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively.

Note 18: Preferred Stock    

We are authorized to issue 20 million shares of preferred stock and 4 million shares of
preference stock, both without par value. Preferred shares outstanding rank senior to common shares both as to dividends and liquidation preference but have no general voting rights. We have not issued any preference shares under this authorization.
If issued, preference shares would be limited to one vote per share. Our total issued and outstanding

preferred stock includes Dividend Equalization Preferred (DEP) shares and Series I, J, K and L, which are presented in the following two tables, and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, which is presented in the table on the following page.   

(1)  
  Preferred shares qualify as Tier 1 capital.     
         206   

In March 2011, the Company issued Series I preferred stock (25,010 shares with a par
value of $2.5 billion) to an unconsolidated wholly-owned trust. We have the option to redeem this Series I Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share.   
  In 2011, we redeemed $9.2 billion of trust preferred securities of which $5.8 billion settled in October 2011. Prior to the October 2011
redemption, we had a commitment to issue Series A preferred stock ($2.5 billion) and Series B preferred stock ($1.8 billion) to unconsolidated wholly-owned trusts. Effective with the redemption, the commitment has been eliminated. See Note 8 for
additional information on our trust preferred securities. We do not have a commitment to issue Series G or H preferred stock.

ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  All shares of our ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock (ESOP Preferred Stock) were issued to a trustee acting on behalf of the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan). Dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of initial issuance and are payable
quarterly at annual rates based upon the year of issuance. Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock released from the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan is converted into shares of our common stock based on the stated value of the ESOP Preferred Stock
and the then current market price of our common stock. The ESOP Preferred Stock is also convertible at the option of the holder at any time, unless previously redeemed. We have the option to redeem the ESOP Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or
in part, at a redemption price per share equal to the higher of (a) $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends or (b) the fair market value, as defined in the Certificates of Designation for the ESOP Preferred Stock.

(2)  
  We recorded a corresponding charge to unearned ESOP shares in connection with the issuance of the ESOP Preferred Stock. The unearned ESOP shares are reduced as shares of the ESOP
Preferred Stock are committed to be released.     
         207   

Note 19: Common Stock and Stock Plans    

Common Stock       The following table presents our reserved, issued and authorized shares of common stock at December 31, 2011.       

(1)  
  Includes employee options, restricted shares and restricted share rights, 401(k), profit sharing and compensation deferral plans.     
  At December 31, 2011, we have warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 39,179,509 shares of our common stock with an
exercise price of $34.01 per share, expiring on October 28, 2018. In 2011 we purchased 264,972 of these warrants. These warrants were issued in connection with our participation in the TARP CPP.   
   Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plans       Participants in our dividend reinvestment and common stock direct purchase plans may purchase shares of our common stock at fair market value under the terms of the plan.   
   Employee Stock Plans       We offer stock
based employee compensation plans as described below. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock options, restricted share rights (RSRs) or performance shares, based on the fair
value of the award on the grant date. The cost is normally recognized in our income statement over the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting are expensed on a straight line method. Awards that continue to vest after retirement are
expensed over the shorter of the period of time between the grant date and the final vesting period or between the grant date and when a team member becomes retirement eligible; awards to team members who are retirement eligible at the grant date
are subject to immediate expensing upon grant.       LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS    
  Our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTICP) provides for awards of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
shares, RSRs, performance share awards and stock awards without restrictions.      During 2011 and 2010 we granted RSRs and
performance shares as our primary long-term incentive awards instead of stock options. Holders of RSRs are entitled to the related shares of common stock at no cost generally over three to five years after the RSRs were granted. Holders of RSRs may
be entitled to receive additional RSRs (dividend equivalents) or cash payments

equal to the cash dividends that would have been paid had the RSRs been issued and outstanding shares of common stock. RSRs granted as dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting
schedule and conditions as the underlying RSRs. RSRs generally continue to vest after retirement according to the original vesting schedule. Except in limited circumstances, RSRs are cancelled when employment ends.   
  Holders of each vested performance share are entitled to the related shares of common stock at no cost. Performance shares continue to
vest after retirement according to the original vesting schedule subject to satisfying the performance criteria and other vesting conditions.      Stock options must have an exercise price at or above fair market value (as defined in the plan) of the stock at the date of grant (except for substitute or replacement options granted in connection with
mergers or other acquisitions) and a term of no more than 10 years. Except for options granted in 2004 and 2005, which generally vested in full upon grant, options generally become exercisable over three years beginning on the first anniversary of
the date of grant. Except as otherwise permitted under the plan, if employment is ended for reasons other than retirement, permanent disability or death, the option exercise period is reduced or the options are cancelled.   
  Options granted prior to 2004 may include the right to acquire a  reload  stock option. If an option contains the reload
feature and if a participant pays all or part of the exercise price of the option with shares of stock purchased in the market or held by the participant for at least six months and, in either case, not used in a similar transaction in the last six
months, upon exercise of the option, the participant is granted a new option to purchase at the fair market value of the stock as of the date of the reload, the number of shares of stock equal to the sum of the number of shares used in payment of
the exercise price and a number of shares with respect to related statutory minimum withholding taxes. Reload grants are fully vested upon grant and are expensed immediately.      Compensation expense for RSRs and performance shares is based on the quoted market price of the related stock at the grant date. Stock option expense is based on the fair value of the awards at the date
of grant. The following table summarizes the major components of stock incentive compensation expense and the related recognized tax benefit.       

208   

Note 19: Common Stock and Stock Plans    (continued)       

A portion of annual bonus awards recognized during 2009 that are normally paid in cash
was paid in our common stock as part of our agreement with the U.S. Treasury to repay our participation in the TARP CPP. The fair value of the stock that was issued was $94 million and there were no vesting conditions or other restrictions on the
stock. No annual bonus awards recognized after 2009 were paid in common stock.      During 2009 the Board of Directors approved
salary increases for certain executive officers that were paid, after taxes and other withholdings, in our common stock. In 2010 and 2009, respectively, 62,630 shares and 244,689 shares were issued for salary increases at an average fair value of
$27.44 and $27.77, respectively. There are no restrictions on these shares because we repaid the TARP CPP investment in Wells Fargo in December 2009. No salary increases were paid in common stock after March 2010.   
  For various acquisitions and mergers, we converted employee and director stock options of acquired or merged companies into stock
options to purchase our common stock based on the terms of the original stock option plan and the agreed-upon exchange ratio. In addition, we converted restricted stock awards into awards that entitle holders to our stock after the vesting
conditions are met. Holders receive cash dividends on outstanding awards if provided in the original award.      The total number
of shares of common stock available for grant under the plans at December 31, 2011, was 157 million.   
    PARTNERSHARES    PLAN  In 1996, we adopted the  PartnerShares       Stock Option Plan, a broad-based employee stock option plan. It covers full- and part-time employees who generally were not included in the LTICP described above.
No options have been granted under the plan since 2002, and as a result of action taken by the Board of Directors on January 22, 2008, no future awards will be granted under the plan. All of our  PartnerShares  Plan grants were fully
vested as of December 31, 2007.       Director Awards       Under the LTICP, we grant common stock and options to purchase common stock to non-employee directors elected or re-elected at the annual meeting of stockholders and prorated awards to directors who join
the Board at any other time. The stock award vests immediately. Options granted to directors can be exercised after twelve months through the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Options granted prior to 2005 may include the right to acquire a
 reload  stock option.   
 
    Restricted Share Rights       A summary of the status of our RSRs and restricted share awards at December 31, 2011, and changes during 2011 is in the following table:   
   
    The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSRs granted during 2010 and 2009 was $27.29 and $19.04,
respectively.      At December 31, 2011, there was $561 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
RSRs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. The total fair value of RSRs that vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $41 million, $15 million and $2 million, respectively.   
   Performance Share Awards       Holders of
performance share awards are entitled to the related shares of common stock at no cost subject to the Company s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period ending December 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, and
December 31, 2012. Performance share awards are granted at a target number; based on the Company s performance, the number of awards that vest can be adjusted downward to zero and upward to a maximum of either 125% or 150% of target.
     A summary of the status of our performance awards at December 31, 2011, and changes during 2011 is in the following
table, based on the target amount of awards:       
    The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance awards granted during 2010 and 2009 was
$27.46 and $27.09, respectively.      At December 31, 2011, there was $45 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to nonvested performance awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years. As of December 31, 2011, no performance shares were vested.

209   

Stock Options       The table below summarizes stock option activity and related information for the stock plans. Options assumed in mergers are included in the activity and related information for Incentive

Compensation Plans if originally issued under an employee plan, and in the activity and related information for Director Awards if originally issued under a director plan.

As of December 31, 2011, there was $8 million of unrecognized compensation cost
related to stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.3 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $246 million, $298 million and $50 million, respectively.
     Cash received from the exercise of stock options for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $554 million, $687 million and $153 million,
respectively.      We do not have a specific policy on repurchasing shares to satisfy share option exercises. Rather, we have a
general policy on repurchasing shares to meet common stock issuance requirements for our benefit plans (including share option exercises), conversion of our convertible securities, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Various factors determine
the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for acquisitions and employee benefit plans, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and
legal considerations. These factors can change at any time, and there can be no assurance as to the number of shares we will repurchase or when we will repurchase them.

The fair value of each option award granted on or after January 1, 2006, is
estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected term of non-reload options granted is generally based on the historical exercise behavior of full-term options. Our expected volatilities are based on a combination of the historical
volatility of our common stock and implied volatilities for traded options on our common stock. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Both expected volatility and the risk-free rates
are based on a period commensurate with our expected term. Beginning in 2009, the expected dividend is based on a fixed dividend amount. We changed our method of estimating the expected dividend assumption from a yield approach to a fixed amount due
to our participation in the TARP CPP during 2009, which restricted us from increasing our dividend without approval from the U.S. Treasury; although we repaid TARP in 2009, federal approval continues to be required before we can increase our
dividend. A dividend yield approach models a constant dividend yield, which was considered inappropriate given the restriction on our ability to increase dividends. See Note 3 for additional information.

210   

Note 19: Common Stock and Stock Plans    (continued)       

The following table presents the weighted-average per share fair value of options granted
and the assumptions used, based on a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Substantially all of the options granted in 2011 and 2010 resulted from the reload feature.       
     Employee Stock Ownership Plan       The Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution plan with an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) feature. Effective December 31, 2009, the Wachovia
Savings Plan, which also had an ESOP feature, merged into the 401(k) Plan, and all of its shares of our common stock were transferred to the 401(k) Plan. The ESOP feature enables the 401(k) Plan to borrow money to purchase our preferred or

common stock. From 1994 through 2011, with the exception of 2009, we loaned money to the 401(k) Plan to purchase shares of our ESOP Preferred Stock. As our employer contributions are made to the
401(k) Plan and are used by the Plan to make ESOP loan payments, the ESOP Preferred Stock in the 401(k) Plan is released and converted into our common shares. Dividends on the common shares allocated as a result of the release and conversion of the
ESOP Preferred Stock reduce retained earnings and the shares are considered outstanding for computing earnings per share. Dividends on the unallocated ESOP Preferred Stock do not reduce retained earnings, and the shares are not considered to be
common stock equivalents for computing earnings per share. Loan principal and interest payments are made from our employer contributions to the 401(k) Plan, along with dividends paid on the ESOP Preferred Stock. With each principal and interest
payment, a portion of the ESOP Preferred Stock is released and converted to common shares, which are allocated to the 401(k) Plan participants and invested in the 401(k) Plan s ESOP Fund.   
  The balance of common stock held in the ESOP fund, the dividends on allocated shares of common stock and unreleased ESOP Preferred Stock
paid to the 401(k) Plan and the fair value of unreleased ESOP Preferred Stock were:   

Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Sales Agents    
  WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent formed solely to sponsor a deferred compensation plan for independent
sales agents who provide investment, financial and other qualifying services for or with respect to participating affiliates.

The Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors, which became effective
January 1, 2002, allows participants to defer all or part of their eligible compensation payable to them by a participating affiliate. The Parent has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the deferred compensation obligations of WF Deferred
Compensation Holdings, Inc. under the plan.   

211   

Note 20: Employee Benefits and Other Expenses      

Pension and Postretirement Plans       We sponsor a noncontributory qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Wells Fargo   Company Cash Balance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of Wells Fargo.
Benefits accrued under the Cash Balance Plan were frozen effective July 1, 2009.      On April 28, 2009, the Board of
Directors approved amendments to freeze the benefits earned under the Wells Fargo qualified and supplemental Cash Balance Plans and the Wachovia Corporation Pension Plan, a cash balance plan that covered eligible employees of the legacy
Wachovia Corporation, and to merge the Wachovia Pension Plan into the qualified Cash Balance Plan. These actions became effective on July 1, 2009.      Prior to July 1, 2009, eligible employees  cash balance plan accounts were allocated a compensation credit based on a percentage of their qualifying compensation. The compensation credit
percentage was based on age and years of credited service. The freeze discontinues the allocation of compensation credit for services after June 30, 2009. Investment credits continue to be allocated to participants based on their accumulated
balances. Employees become vested in their Cash Balance Plan accounts after completing three years of vesting service.   
  Freezing and merging the above plans effective July 1, 2009, resulted in a re-measurement of the pension obligations and plan
assets as of April 30, 2009. As a result of freezing our pension plans, we revised our amortization life for actuarial gains and losses from 5 years to 13 years to reflect the estimated

average remaining participation period. These actions lowered pension cost by approximately $500 million for 2009, including $67 million of one-time curtailment gains.   
  We did not make a contribution to our Cash Balance Plan in 2011. We do not expect that we will be required to make a contribution to the
Cash Balance Plan in 2012; however, this is dependent on the finalization of the actuarial valuation. Our decision of whether to make a contribution in 2012 will be based on various factors including the actual investment performance of plan assets
during 2012. Given these uncertainties, we cannot estimate at this time the amount, if any, that we will contribute in 2012 to the Cash Balance Plan. For the nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, there is no minimum required
contribution beyond the amount needed to fund benefit payments; we may contribute more to our postretirement benefit plans dependent on various factors.      We provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees and reserve the right to terminate, modify or amend any of the benefits at any time.   
  The information set forth in the following tables is based on current actuarial reports using the measurement date of December 31
for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.      The changes in the projected benefit obligation of pension benefits and
the accumulated benefit obligation of other benefits and the fair value of plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized in the balance sheet were:

212   

Note 20: Employee Benefits and Other Expenses    (continued)       

The accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans was
$11.3 billion and $11.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      The following table provides
information for pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

The components of net
periodic benefit cost were:       
 
         213   

Amounts recognized in accumulated OCI (pre tax) consist of:   

We generally amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from
accumulated OCI into net periodic pension cost over the estimated average remaining participation period. The net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into
net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is $141 million. The net prior service credit for the other post retirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is $2 million.

Plan Assumptions       For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for pension benefits (qualified and nonqualified) was 5.00% and
5.25%, respectively, and for other postretirement benefits was 4.75% and 5.25%, respectively. We use a consistent methodology to determine the discount rate that is based on an established yield curve methodology. This methodology incorporates a
broad group of top quartile Aa bonds consisting of approximately 250-275 bonds. The discount rate is determined by matching this yield curve with the timing and amounts of the expected benefit payments for our plans.

The weighted-average assumptions used
to determine the net periodic benefit cost were:       

(1)  
  Includes both qualified and nonqualified pension benefits.     

(2)  
  Due to the freeze of the Wells Fargo qualified and supplemental Cash Balance Plans and the Wachovia Corporation Pension Plan, the discount rate for the 2009 pension benefits was
the weighted average of 6.75% from January through April and 7.75% from May through December.     

Our determination of the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected returns under two sets of conditions: projected returns using several forward-looking capital market assumptions, and historical returns for the main
asset classes dating back to 1970 or the earliest period for which historical data was readily available for the asset classes included. Using long term historical data allows us to capture multiple economic environments, which we believe is
relevant when using historical returns. We place greater emphasis on the forward-looking return and risk assumptions than on historical results. We use the resulting projections to derive a base line expected rate of return and risk level for the
Cash Balance Plans  prescribed asset mix.      We evaluate the portfolio based on: (1) the established target asset
allocations over short term (one-year) and longer term (ten-year) investment horizons, and (2) the range of potential

outcomes over these horizons within specific standard deviations. We perform the above analyses to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We consider
the expected rate of return to be a long-term average view of expected returns. The expected rate of return would be assessed for significant long-term changes in economic conditions or in planned portfolio composition.   
  To account for postretirement health care plans we use health care cost trend rates to recognize the effect of expected changes in
future health care costs due to medical inflation, utilization changes, new technology, regulatory requirements and Medicare cost shifting. In determining the end of year benefit obligation we assume average annual increases of approximately 7.75%
for health care costs in 2012. This rate is assumed to trend down 0.25% per year until the trend rate reaches an ultimate rate of 5.0% in 2023. The 2011 periodic benefit cost was determined using initial annual trend rates of 8.0%. These rates
were assumed to decrease 0.25% per year   

214   

Note 20: Employee Benefits and Other Expenses    (continued)       

until they reached ultimate rates of 5.0% in 2023. Increasing the assumed health care trend by one
percentage point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011, by $63 million and the total of the interest cost and service cost components of the net periodic benefit cost for 2011 by $3 million.
Decreasing the assumed health care trend by one percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011, by $56 million and the total of the interest cost and service cost components of the net periodic
benefit cost for 2011 by $3 million.       Investment Strategy and Asset Allocation    
  We seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a prudent level of risk given the benefit obligations of the pension plans and their funded
status. Our overall investment strategy is designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a balance of long-term growth opportunities and short-term benefit strategies while ensuring that risk is mitigated through diversification across numerous
asset classes and various investment strategies. We target the asset allocation for our Cash Balance Plan at a target mix range of 35-55% equities, 35-55% fixed income, and approximately 10% in real estate, venture capital, private equity and other
investments. The Employee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes several members of senior management, formally reviews the investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and
periodic asset/liability evaluations are also conducted.      The investment strategy for assets held in the Retiree Medical Plan
Voluntary Employees  Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust is established separately from the strategy for the assets in the Cash Balance Plan. The general target asset mix is 20-40% equities and 60-80% fixed income. In addition, the strategy
for the VEBA trust assets considers the effect of income taxes by utilizing a combination of variable annuity and low turnover investment strategies. Members of the EBRC formally review the investment risk and performance of these assets on a
quarterly basis.   
 
    Projected Benefit Payments       Future benefits that we expect to pay under the pension and other benefit plans are presented in the following table. Other benefits payments are expected to be reduced by prescription drug subsidies from
the federal government provided by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.       

215   

Fair Value of Plan Assets       The following table presents the balances of pension plan assets and other benefit plan assets measured at fair value. Other benefit plan assets include assets held in a 401(h) trust, which

are invested using the same asset allocation targets as the Cash Balance Plan, and assets held in a VEBA trust. See Note 17 for fair value hierarchy level definitions.

(1)  
  This category includes a diversified mix of assets which are being managed in accordance with a duration target of approximately 10 years and an emphasis on corporate credit
bonds combined with investments in U.S. Treasury securities and other U.S. agency and non-agency bonds. Investments in this category were made beginning in 2011.     

(2)  
  This category includes assets that are primarily intermediate duration, investment grade bonds held in investment strategies benchmarked to the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate
Bond Index. Includes U.S. Treasury securities, agency and non-agency asset-backed bonds and corporate bonds.     

(3)  
  This category covers a broad range of investment styles, both active and passive approaches, as well as style characteristics of value, core and growth emphasized strategies.
Assets in this category are currently diversified across nine unique investment strategies. For December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, approximately 34% and 33% of the assets within this category are passively managed to popular mainstream
market indexes including the Standard   Poor s 500 Index; excluding the allocation to the S P 500 Index strategy, no single investment manager represents more than 2.5% of total plan assets.     

(4)  
  This category consists of a highly diversified combination of four distinct investment management strategies with no single strategy representing more than 2% of total plan
assets. Allocations in this category are primarily spread across actively managed approaches with distinct value and growth emphasized approaches in fairly equal proportions.     

(5)  
  This category includes assets diversified across eight unique investment strategies providing exposure to companies based primarily in developed market, non-U.S. countries with
no single strategy representing more than 2.5% of total plan assets.     

(6)  
  This category primarily includes investments in private and public real estate, as well as timber specific limited partnerships; real estate holdings are diversified by
geographic location and sector (e.g., retail, office, apartments).     

(7)  
  This category consists of several investment strategies diversified over 30 hedge fund managers. Single manager allocation exposure is limited to 0.15% (15 basis points) of total
plan assets.

Note 20: Employee Benefits and Other Expenses    (continued)       
        The changes in Level 3 pension plan and other benefit plan assets measured at
fair value are summarized as follows:       

(1)  
  All unrealized gains (losses) relate to instruments held at period end.     

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES  Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets
measured at fair value.      Cash and Cash Equivalents   includes highly liquid government securities such as U.S. Treasuries. Also includes
investments in collective investment funds valued at fair value based upon the quoted market values of the underlying net assets. The unit price is quoted on a private market that is not active; however, the unit price is based on underlying
investments traded on an active market. Investments in registered investment companies are valued at the NAV of shares held at year end.      Long
Duration, Intermediate (Core), High-Yield, International and Specialty Fixed Income   includes investments traded on the secondary markets; prices are measured by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models, discounted
cash flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the

market where available or combination of multiple valuation techniques. Also includes investments in registered investment companies, collective investment funds and government securities
described above.      Domestic, International and Emerging Market Stocks   investments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at
quoted market values. Also includes investments in registered investment companies and collective investment funds described above.      Real
Estate and Timber   the fair value of real estate and timber is estimated based primarily on appraisals prepared by third-party appraisers. Market values are estimates and the actual market price of the real estate can only be determined by
negotiation between independent third parties in a sales transaction. Also includes investments in exchange-traded equity securities described above.

217   

Multi-Strategy Hedge Funds and Private Equity   the fair values of hedge funds are valued based on the
proportionate share of the underlying net assets of the investment funds that comprise the fund, based on valuations supplied by the underlying investment funds. Investments in private equity funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund sponsor.
Market values are estimates and the actual market price of the investments can only be determined by negotiation between independent third parties in a sales transaction.      Other   the fair values of miscellaneous investments are valued at the NAV provided by the fund sponsor. Market values are estimates and the actual market price of the investments can only be
determined by negotiation between independent third parties in a sales transaction. Also includes insurance contracts that are generally stated at cash surrender value.      The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
      Defined Contribution Retirement Plans       We sponsor a defined contribution retirement plan named the Wells Fargo   Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan). The Wachovia Savings Plan was acquired December 31, 2008, and merged
with the 401(k) Plan effective December 31, 2009. We also sponsored a frozen defined contribution plan, the A.G. Edwards, Inc. Retirement   Profit Sharing Plan ( AGE Plan ), which resulted from a company acquired by Wachovia.
The AGE Plan merged with the 401(k) Plan on July 1, 2011. Under the 401(k) Plan, after one month of service, eligible employees may contribute up to 50% of their certified compensation, although there may be a lower limit for certain highly
compensated employees in order to maintain the qualified status of the 401(k) Plan. Eligible employees who complete one year of service are eligible for company matching contributions, which are generally dollar for dollar up to 6% of an
employee s certified compensation. Effective January 1, 2010, previous and future matching contributions are 100% vested for active participants.      In 2009, the 401(k) Plan was amended to permit us to make discretionary profit sharing contributions. Based on 2011, 2010 and 2009 earnings, we committed to make a contribution in shares of common stock
to eligible employees  401(k) Plan accounts equaling 2% of certified compensation for 2011 and 2010, and 1% of certified compensation for 2009, respectively, which resulted in recognizing $311 million, $316 million and $150 million of
defined contribution retirement plan expense recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total defined contribution retirement plan expenses were $1,104 million,

$1,092 million and $862 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   
   Other Expenses       Expenses exceeding 1% of
total interest income and noninterest income in any of the years presented that are not otherwise shown separately in the financial statements or Notes to Financial Statements were:

Note 21: Income Taxes    

The components of income tax expense were:   
   
    The tax effects of our temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of these deferred
tax assets and liabilities are presented in the following table.       
    Deferred taxes related to net unrealized gains (losses) on securities available for sale, net
unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives, foreign currency translation, and employee benefit plan adjustments are recorded in cumulative OCI (see Note 23). These associated adjustments increased OCI by $1.1 billion in 2011.   
  We have determined that a valuation allowance is required for 2011 in the amount of $918 million primarily attributable to

deferred tax assets in various state and foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. In these jurisdictions, carry back
limitations, lack of sources of taxable income, and tax planning strategy limitations contributed to our conclusion that the deferred tax assets would not be realizable. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred
tax assets will be realized based on our history of earnings, sources of taxable income in carry back periods, and our ability to implement tax planning strategies.      At December 31, 2011, we had net operating loss and credit carry forwards with related deferred tax assets of $1.6 billion and $81 million, respectively. If these carry forwards are not
utilized, they will expire in varying amounts through 2031.      At December 31, 2011, we had undistributed foreign earnings
of $1.2 billion related to foreign subsidiaries. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely outside the U.S. and accordingly have not provided $339 million of income tax liability on these earnings.   
  The following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax expense and rate to the effective income tax expense and rate. Effective
January 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance that changed the way noncontrolling interests are presented in the income statement such that the consolidated income statement includes amounts from both Wells Fargo interests and the
noncontrolling interests. As a result, our effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense by income before income tax expense less the net income from noncontrolling interests.

219   

The effective tax rate for 2011 decreased primarily due to tax benefits from the
realization for tax purposes of a previously written down investment, a decrease in tax expense associated with leveraged leases, as well as tax benefits related to charitable donations of appreciated securities.   
  The change in unrecognized tax benefits follows:       
    Of the $5.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, approximately $3.3 billion would,
if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. The remaining $1.7 billion of unrecognized tax benefits relates to income tax positions on temporary differences.      We recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have accrued approximately $871 million and $870 million for the payment of
interest and penalties, respectively. We recognized in income tax expense in 2011 and 2010, interest and penalties of $32 million and $45 million, respectively.      We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries are not subject to federal, state,
local and foreign income tax examinations for taxable years prior to 2007; and Wachovia Corporation and its subsidiaries are not subject to federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations for taxable years prior to 2006.   
  We are routinely examined by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. The IRS is currently examining the 2007 through 2010 consolidated
federal income tax returns of Wells Fargo  

Company and its subsidiaries. We are also litigating or appealing various issues related to our prior IRS examinations for the periods 1999 and 2003 through 2006. For Wachovia s 2003 through
2008 tax years, we are appealing various issues related to their IRS examinations. We have paid the IRS the contested income tax associated with these issues and refund claims have been filed for the respective years. In addition, we are currently
subject to examination by various state, local and foreign taxing authorities. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved within the next twelve months, we do not anticipate that there will be a significant impact to
our unrecognized tax benefits as a result of these examinations.      During 2010, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in connection with the adverse judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims related to certain leveraged lease transactions that we entered into between 1997 and 2002. On April 15, 2011, the Federal Circuit
affirmed the decision of the Court of Federal Claims. There was no adverse financial statement impact resulting from the Federal Circuit s decision.      On September 30, 2011, we received an adverse decision from the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota in WFC Holdings Corp. v. United States, a case involving a lease restructuring
transaction. There was no adverse financial statement impact from the decision. On December 1, 2011, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.   
  We estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits will not change significantly during the next 12 months.

numerator and denominator of both earnings per common share calculations.

The following table presents the outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock that
were anti-dilutive (the exercise price was higher than the weighted-average market price), and therefore not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share.

Note 24: Operating Segments      

We have three operating segments for management reporting: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement. The results for these operating segments are based on our management accounting process, for which there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance equivalent to GAAP for financial accounting. The management
accounting process measures the performance of the operating segments based on our management structure and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial services companies. We define our operating segments by product
type and customer segment. If the management structure and/or the allocation process changes, allocations, transfers and assignments may change. In first quarter 2010, we conformed certain funding and allocation methodologies of legacy Wachovia to
those of Wells Fargo; in addition, integration expense related to mergers other than the Wachovia merger is now included in segment results. In fourth quarter 2010, we aligned certain lending businesses into Wholesale Banking from Community Banking
to reflect our previously announced restructuring of Wells Fargo Financial. In first quarter 2011, we realigned a private equity business into Wholesale Banking from Community Banking. The prior periods have been revised to reflect these changes.
      Community Banking  offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services to consumers and small
businesses with annual sales generally up to $20 million in which the owner generally is the financial decision maker. Community Banking also offers investment management and other services to retail customers and securities brokerage through
affiliates. These products and services include the  Wells Fargo Advantage Funds    SM   , a family of mutual funds. Loan products include lines of credit, auto floor plan lines, equity lines and loans, equipment and transportation loans, education loans, origination and purchase of
residential mortgage loans and servicing of mortgage loans and credit cards. Other credit products and financial services available to small businesses and their owners include equipment leases, real estate and other commercial financing, Small
Business Administration financing, venture capital financing, cash management, payroll services, retirement plans, Health Savings Accounts, credit cards, and merchant payment processing. Community Banking also purchases sales finance contracts from
retail merchants throughout the United States and retail installment contracts from auto dealers in the United States and Puerto Rico. Consumer and business deposit products include checking accounts, savings deposits, market rate accounts,
Individual Retirement Accounts, time deposits, global remittance and debit cards.      Community Banking serves customers through
a complete range of channels, including traditional banking stores, in-store banking centers, business centers, ATMs, Online and Mobile Banking, and  Wells Fargo Customer Connection,  a 24-hours a day, seven days a week telephone service.

Wholesale Banking  provides financial solutions to businesses across the United
States with annual sales generally in excess of $20 million and to financial institutions globally. Wholesale Banking provides a complete line of commercial, corporate, capital markets, cash management and real estate banking products and services.
These include traditional commercial loans and lines of credit, letters of credit, asset-based lending, equipment leasing, international trade facilities, trade financing, collection services, foreign exchange services, treasury management,
investment management, institutional fixed-income sales, interest rate, commodity and equity risk management, online/electronic products such as the  Commercial Electronic Office       ( CEO      ) portal,
insurance, corporate trust fiduciary and agency services, and investment banking services. Wholesale Banking manages customer investments through institutional separate accounts and mutual funds, including the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds and
Wells Capital Management. Wholesale Banking also supports the CRE market with products and services such as construction loans for commercial and residential development, land acquisition and development loans, secured and unsecured lines of credit,
interim financing arrangements for completed structures, rehabilitation loans, affordable housing loans and letters of credit, permanent loans for securitization, CRE loan servicing and real estate and mortgage brokerage services.   
   Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement  provides a full range of financial advisory services to clients using a planning approach to meet each
client s needs. Wealth Management provides affluent and high net worth clients with a complete range of wealth management solutions, including financial planning, private banking, credit, investment management and trust. Family Wealth (to be
rebranded as Abbot Downing, a Wells Fargo Business, in April 2012) meets the unique needs of ultra high net worth customers. Brokerage serves customers  advisory, brokerage and financial needs as part of one of the largest full-service
brokerage firms in the United States. Retirement is a national leader in providing institutional retirement and trust services (including 401(k) and pension plan record keeping) for businesses, retail retirement solutions for individuals, and
reinsurance services for the life insurance industry.       Other  includes corporate items (such as integration expenses related to the
Wachovia merger) not specific to a business segment and elimination of certain items that are included in more than one business segment.

223   

(1)  
  Includes Wachovia integration expenses and the elimination of items that are included in both Community Banking and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement, largely representing
services and products for wealth management customers provided in Community Banking stores.     

(2)  
  Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of liabilities to fund those assets. Interest earned includes actual interest earned on
segment assets and, if the segment has excess liabilities, interest credits for providing funding to other segments. The cost of liabilities includes interest expense on segment liabilities and, if the segment does not have enough liabilities to
fund its assets, a funding charge based on the cost of excess liabilities from another segment.     

(3)  
  Represents segment net income (loss) for Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement segments and Wells Fargo net income for the consolidated
company.

Note 25: Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements    

Following are the condensed consolidating financial statements of the Parent and Wells Fargo Financial,
Inc. and its owned subsidiaries (WFFI). In 2002, the Parent issued a full and unconditional guarantee of all outstanding term debt securities and commercial paper of WFFI. WFFI ceased filing periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and is no

longer a separately rated company. The Parent also guaranteed all outstanding term debt securities of Wells Fargo Canada Corporation (WFCC), WFFI s wholly owned Canadian subsidiary. WFCC has
continued to issue term debt securities and commercial paper in Canada, unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent.

Note 26: Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements    

The Company and each of its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements
promulgated by federal regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company, and the OCC has similar requirements for the Company s
national banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.      We do not consolidate our wholly-owned trust (the Trust) formed solely to
issue trust preferred and preferred purchase securities (the Securities). Securities issued by the Trust includable in Tier 1 capital were $7.5 billion at December 31, 2011. Since December 31, 2010, we have called $9.2 billion of trust
preferred securities, and also issued $2.5 billion in Series I Preferred Stock, replacing certain preferred purchase securities reflected in the amount of Securities issued by the Trust includable in Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2010. The
Series I

Preferred Stock was included in preferred stock (Note 18), as a separate component of Tier 1 capital. The junior subordinated debentures held by the Trust were included in the Company s
long-term debt.      Certain subsidiaries of the Company are approved seller/servicers, and are therefore required to maintain
minimum levels of shareholders  equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At December 31, 2011, each seller/servicer met these requirements.
Certain broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to SEC Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule), which requires that we maintain minimum levels of net capital, as defined. At December 31, 2011, each of these subsidiaries met these
requirements.      The following table presents regulatory capital information for Wells Fargo   Company and Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A.   

(1)  
  As defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC.     

(2)  
  The leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items. The minimum leverage ratio guideline is 3%
for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and that have well-diversified risk, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings, effective management and monitoring of market risk and, in general, are considered
top-rated, strong banking organizations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm      
      The Board of Directors and Stockholders
     Wells Fargo   Company:   
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wells Fargo   Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31,
2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
     In 2010, the Company adopted a new accounting standard related to its involvement with variable interest entities, and in 2009, the Company
changed its method of evaluating other than temporary impairment for debt securities.      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.
