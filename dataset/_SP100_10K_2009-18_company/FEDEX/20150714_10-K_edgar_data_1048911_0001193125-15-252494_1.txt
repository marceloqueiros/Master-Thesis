ITEM 1.   
   BUSINESS          Overview    
  FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing
collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four business segments:       

FedEx Express  : Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ) is the world s largest express transportation company,
offering time-definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories, connecting markets that comprise more than 90% of the world s gross domestic product. The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade Networks, Inc. ( FedEx
Trade Networks ), which provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding, FedEx SupplyChain Systems, Inc. ( FedEx SupplyChain Systems ), which offers a range of

FedEx Ground  : FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ) is a leading North American provider of small-package ground
delivery services. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the U.S. and Canada, as well as residential delivery to nearly 100% of U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. The FedEx Ground
segment also includes FedEx SmartPost, Inc. ( FedEx SmartPost ), which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages using the U.S. Postal Service
( USPS ) for final delivery to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S., and GENCO Distribution System, Inc. ( GENCO ), which is a leading North American third-party logistics provider.

freight services across all lengths of haul, offering: FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet supply chain needs; and FedEx Freight Economy, when time can be traded for cost savings. The FedEx Freight segment also offers freight

   Our website is located at  fedex.com . Detailed information about our services, e-commerce tools and
solutions, and citizenship efforts can be found on our website. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through
our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The Investor Relations page of our website,  http://investors.fedex.com , contains a significant amount of information about FedEx, including our
SEC filings and financial and other information for investors. The information that FedEx posts on its Investor Relations website could be deemed to be material information. FedEx encourages investors, the media and others interested in the company
to visit this website from time to time, as information is updated and new information is posted. The information on our website, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year indicates our fiscal year ended May 31 of the year referenced.   
   Strategy       FedEx was incorporated in
Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient,
seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services.      We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information
systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated across operating companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies, we make it convenient for
customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business synergies from multiple operating units. For example, our website,  fedex.com , provides a single point of
contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipping, pickup, shipment tracking, customer service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly, by making one call to FedEx Expedited
Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one
point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their pickup-and-delivery requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped. Also, we have integrated our LTL and parcel sales
teams to enhance the effectiveness of our sales efforts and provide additional simplicity for our customers.      We manage our business as a
portfolio   in the long-term best interest of the enterprise, not a particular operating company. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or
enhancements on achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings
performance and cash flow. We are also focused on increasing returns to our stockholders, as evidenced by the recent increase in our quarterly dividend.      While we have increased our emphasis on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results
in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business unit. Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding
service to our customers. Each company s operations, cost structure and culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result, we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs.
     Our  compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively  strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various
operating companies to align with varying macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage   
         - 4 -

change. Volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy. For
example, in response to sluggish economic growth, in 2013 we retired from service 10 aircraft and related engines and shortened the depreciable lives of an additional 76 aircraft and related engines. In 2014, we began replacing some of our retired
aircraft with the more efficient, lower-emission Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft ( B767F ). The B767F is approximately 30% more fuel efficient and has unit operating costs that are more than 20% lower than the MD10 aircraft it is
replacing. In 2015, to continue rationalizing capacity and modernizing our aircraft fleet to more effectively serve customers, we retired an additional 15 aircraft and 21 related engines and adjusted the retirement schedule of 23 aircraft and 57
engines.      At the same time, we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful FedEx Ground segment where we continue
to boost package volumes.      The following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace, and we believe they will
continue to do so over the long term:       

Globalization:   As the world s economy has become more fully integrated, companies are sourcing and selling globally. With customers
in more than 220 countries and territories, we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach, delivery services and information capabilities. Despite the recent slow-down in global trade growth, we continue to believe that globalization will
drive international volume growth over the long term.          

Supply Chain Acceleration:   While the growth of global trade has slowed, companies of all sizes continue to depend on the delivery of
just-in-time inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the move toward more efficient supply chains by helping customers obtain more visibility into their supply chains and near real-time information to manage inventory in motion,
thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding time-to-market.          

Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added Businesses:   High-tech and high-value-added goods have increased as a percentage of total
economic output, and our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and high-value-added industries.      

Growth of E-Commerce:   E-commerce continues to be a catalyst for the other three trends and is a vital growth engine for businesses, as
the Internet is increasingly being used to purchase goods and services. Through our global transportation and technology networks, we contribute to and benefit from the growth of e-commerce.      
  These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access   to goods, services and information. Through our global transportation,
information technology and retail networks, we help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability. To this
end, we are investing in long-term strategic projects focused on expanding and modernizing our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience, such as investments in Boeing 777-300 Freighter ( B777F )
and B767F aircraft. We also continue to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers. For example, during 2015, we:   

Entered into an agreement to acquire TNT Express N.V. ( TNT Express ), which will allow us to more quickly broaden our portfolio of
international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends, especially the continuing growth in e-commerce.          

Made the strategic acquisition of Bongo, a leader in cross-border enablement technologies and solutions, which has capabilities that complement and
expand the FedEx portfolio of offerings important to the rapidly growing global e-commerce market.      
         - 5 -

Made the strategic acquisition of GENCO, a leading North American third-party logistics provider, allowing us to expand our service offerings in the
growing e-commerce marketplace.          

Continued to reduce transit times and provide a better pickup experience within FedEx Ground s growing and highly profitable network.

Launched FedEx Global Returns, a shipping solution designed to simplify the worldwide returns process via FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, enhancing
customers  ability to manage their returns through editable return labels, customs documents and flexible return destinations.          

Marked significant milestones in our FedEx Express European business, including 30 years of service in the German market, the successful integration of
Opek Sp. z o.o. in Poland, which was acquired in 2012, and expansion into the Nordic market through a new facility that is being built at Copenhagen Airport, Denmark, which will serve as a gateway for inbound and outbound shipments for Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden.          

Enhanced service offerings at FedEx Office through: FedEx Pack Plus, an in-store packing solution where specially trained FedEx Office pack and ship
professionals can help pack items that will not fit into typical boxes; and the expansion of the range of professional print products available for commercial customers, and small businesses and consumers through FedEx Office retail locations.
         Profit Improvement Initiatives       During 2013, we saw challenging global economic conditions   particularly for FedEx Express   as ongoing shifts from priority to deferred shipping services significantly impacted profitability.
In response to these trends, in 2013 we announced programs targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion. Our plans position FedEx Express to exit 2016 with a run rate of $1.6 billion of additional operating profit from the then 2013
base business. Our profit improvement programs include multiple initiatives, primarily across FedEx Express and FedEx Services, that are reducing our overall cost structure and enhancing the quality of our revenue.   
  In 2015 we made substantial progress in achieving our profit improvement goals. The FedEx Express segment has improved operating income by approximately
70% from 2013 with essentially flat revenue during the three-year period. FedEx Services has reduced its total expenses while investing in major information technology transformation projects. In addition, our incentive compensation programs have
been gradually reinstated so that 2016 business plan objectives represent more fully funded compensation targets.      During 2014, we completed a
voluntary program offering cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. As a result of this program, approximately 3,600 employees left the company.      We are also streamlining support functions and eliminating redundant systems and processes. At the same time, in addition to modernizing our air fleet, we are transforming our U.S. domestic express
network by closing and realigning regional and district facilities, reorganizing pickup-and-delivery operations while maintaining our outstanding service levels, improving flight and crew scheduling, refining aircraft maintenance processes and
improving fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet.      Internationally, we are working to improve the quality of our international revenue as
customers continue to make more economical choices in a low-growth global economy by moving the linehaul of certain slower-moving shipments to third-party transportation providers and better leveraging capacity within the FedEx Express international
network through, for example, the reduction of flights to and from Asia. Recent international acquisitions will also help drive increases in international domestic revenues. Lastly, we are improving revenue quality by adding value for our customers
with innovative and market-leading

solutions, adding services for vertical industries, including healthcare and aerospace, and expanding our e-commerce service offerings. Our way forward is clear, as we continue to make FedEx an
even leaner, more efficient business.       Reputation and Responsibility       By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the world s most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world,
and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2015, FedEx ranked 12th in  FORTUNE  magazine s  World s Most Admired Companies  list   the 14th
consecutive year we have been ranked in the top 20 on the list. Additionally, FedEx ranked 17th on the Reputation Institute s 2015  Most Reputable Companies in the U.S.  list, which measures the corporate reputations of the largest
U.S. companies based on consumers  trust, esteem, admiration and good feeling towards a company. Lastly, in 2015 FedEx was again listed on  Corporate Responsibility Magazine s   100 Best Corporate Citizens  list.   
  FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and for technological innovation, but also in global citizenship. We
understand that a sustainable global business is tied to our global citizenship, and we are committed to connecting the world responsibly and resourcefully. Our latest published update to our global citizenship report is available at
 http://csr.fedex.com . These reports describe how we think about our responsibilities in the area of global citizenship and include important goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling these responsibilities.   
    Our People     
  Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For
instance, for the past four years, since its inaugural release, FedEx Express was named as one of the top global companies to work for by The Great Place to Work      Institute in its ranking of the World s Best Multinational Workplaces. In order to even be considered for this honor, a company must appear on at least five
national Best Workplaces lists and have at least 5,000 employees worldwide. It is our people   our greatest asset   that give us our strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human
network, with more than 325,000 team members who are  absolutely, positively  focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and
Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare. For additional information on our people-first philosophy and workplace initiatives, see  http://csr.fedex.com .   
    Our Community        FedEx is
committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources and network. We provide financial contributions, in-kind charitable shipping services and volunteer efforts by our team
members to help a variety of non-profit organizations achieve their goals and make a measurable impact on the world. We have three core focus areas: disaster preparedness, relief and recovery (American Red Cross, Direct Relief and The Salvation
Army); pedestrian and road safety (Safe Kids Worldwide, United Nations Road Safety Collaboration and EMBARQ); and sustainability (EMBARQ, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the Arbor Day Foundation,). We support minority access to higher
education by funding scholarships, are a major sponsor of the National Civil Rights Museum and also support Teach for America, Junior Achievement and ORBIS International. Additionally, FedEx supports communities throughout the U.S. with an annual
United Way employee giving campaign. In the midst of the Ebola outbreak that ravaged West Africa, FedEx teamed with numerous humanitarian organizations and government agencies that were leading the U.S. government s Ebola response efforts to
move much needed medical materials to Monrovia, Liberia, an area heavily affected by the Ebola virus. Similarly, in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Nepal, FedEx   
         - 7 -

worked with disaster relief agencies and committed approximately $1 million in cash, transportation support and a chartered flight to deliver critical medical aid and supplies. For additional
information on our community involvement and disaster relief efforts, see  http://csr.fedex.com .        The Environment
       In furtherance of our commitment to protecting the environment, we have made significant progress over the last several years in an
effort to increase FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency 30% from a 2005 baseline by 2020   we have already reached more than 29% cumulative improvement in fuel economy. Having nearly achieved our goal, the company expects to surpass and then
revisit the goal in 2016. We also continue with our goal to reduce aircraft emissions by 30% by 2020 on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis, a goal that we increased from 20% in 2012. We have also established a goal of obtaining 30% of our jet
fuel from alternative fuels by the year 2030. These efforts help us continue to reduce our environmental footprint as evidenced in 2014 when we saved 100 million gallons of jet fuel at FedEx Express and avoided more than 976,000 metric tons of
carbon emissions   all while our volumes were up.      We will continue to expand on-site renewable energy generation in
our facilities where feasible. To meet our future operational needs, as discussed above, we are adding more fuel-efficient aircraft to our fleet. The use of newer and more fuel-efficient aircraft is reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and airport
noise and increasing our jet fuel efficiency. We have an impressive global alternative fuel fleet with over 1,045 alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen fueled vehicles, among others. We operate eleven solar facilities
around the world, which collectively avoided 3,145 metric tons of CO   2   e emissions in 2014. In addition, ten FedEx Express facilities in the U.S. have received certification in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED     ), the U.S. Green Building Council s system for rating the environmental performance of buildings, and six more
are being reviewed for certification. FedEx Express has made LEED certification the standard for newly built U.S. facilities. In addition, two FedEx Ground facilities achieved LEED certification in 2014 and FedEx Ground is pursuing certification at
three more facilities.      We also continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of our packaging and copy and print services, and minimize
waste generation through efforts that include recycling and the use of copy paper with recycled content, among other environmentally-responsible available choices. In 2014, 98% of paper purchased for use by FedEx Office was third-party-certified as
responsibly sourced. We also use FedEx-branded cardboard packaging at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which is made from approximately 60% recycled content. One example of our environmentally-responsible activities is the Sustainable Purchasing
Leadership Council, a U.S. nonprofit organization that supports and recognizes sustainable procurement of which we are a founding member. We continue to support the Council, contributing to discussions on how to improve sustainable purchasing in the
areas of transportation and fuels, fiber- and timber-based products and more. For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see  http://csr.fedex.com .   
    Governance        FedEx has an
independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance. The Board has taken significant steps to enhance its accountability to stockholders in recent years. For example, in September 2011, stockholders approved our
proposal to amend FedEx s certificate of incorporation in order to allow holders of 20% or more of FedEx s common stock the right to call special meetings of stockholders. Additionally, in June 2012, the Board adopted a lead independent

   FedEx Express Segment         FedEx
Express         Overview

  FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Overnight and deferred
package services are backed by money-back guarantees and extend to nearly the entire U.S. population. FedEx Express offers three U.S. overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight.
FedEx SameDay service is available for urgent shipments up to 150 pounds to virtually any U.S. destination. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services backed by money-back guarantees to handle the needs of the
time-definite freight market. Additionally, FedEx One Rate gives U.S. customers a simple, predictable flat rate shipping option that is calculated based on the packaging type, service selected and destination.

   We also provide FedEx Delivery Manager, which allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home
deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. By signing up at  fedex.com , customers can receive notification of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground packages en route to their

Services   Customer-Driven Technology.        International Expansion       We are focused on the long-term expansion of our international presence, especially in key markets such as China, India, Europe, Latin America and Southern Africa. In April 2015, we entered into a
conditional agreement to acquire TNT Express, which has express delivery operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Following the closing of the acquisition, we anticipate integrating the TNT Express operations
with the FedEx Express network. This acquisition will expand our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, lower our costs to serve European markets by increasing density in our pickup-and-delivery operations and accelerate our global growth.
     In 2014 we made a strategic move in Southern Africa by acquiring the businesses operated by our service provider in the following seven
countries: South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zambia. These acquisitions, along with our 2013 acquisitions of transportation companies in Poland, France and Brazil and our 2012 acquisition of a Mexican domestic
express package delivery company, gives us more robust global transportation networks and added capabilities in important international markets, continues our strategic European, Latin American and African growth plans and are expected to provide
important contributions to our long-term growth, productivity and profitability. As part of our European growth strategy, FedEx Express plans to open a new gateway facility in 2016 for inbound and outbound shipments for Denmark, Finland, Norway and
Sweden. The building is a milestone for FedEx Express growth in the Nordics region, which has seen the opening of eight new stations since 2011. The facility will give customers better connectivity from the Nordics to Europe and the rest of the
world.      Since we began serving mainland China in 1984, we have expanded our service to cover more than 400 cities across the country and, in
2009, we began operations at our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China. Our new North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which opened in April 2014, serves as a
consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S., and operates as an international gateway for customers in western Japan. Additionally, in October 2012, we announced plans to establish a new International Express and Cargo Hub in
Shanghai. This new facility, with designated onsite customs clearance, will be located at Shanghai s Pudong International Airport and is slated for completion in early 2017. These hubs will allow us to continue to better serve our global
customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets.      To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of
international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.

    U.S. Postal Service Agreement       In 2013, FedEx Express entered into a new seven-year agreement with the USPS for the provision of domestic air transportation services to the USPS for its First Class, Priority and Express Mail that runs
through September 2020. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed ( GXG ) under a separate agreement. For more information about our
relationship with the USPS, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ).       Pricing    
  FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its services. In general, shipping rates are based on the
service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. As announced in September 2014, FedEx Express increased shipping rates by an average of 4.9% for U.S.
domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services, effective January 5, 2015.      FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic
and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on a rounded average of a certain spot price for jet fuel. For
example, the fuel surcharge for May 2015 was based on the average spot price for jet fuel published for March 2015. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the average spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express
trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two weeks before the
surcharge is applicable. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and our fuel surcharge methodology. On February 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at FedEx Express. The weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S.
outbound fuel surcharge as a percentage of the base rates for the past three years was: 2015   6%; 2014   9%; and 2013   12%. The 2013 percentage reflects certain fuel surcharge reductions that were associated with our 2013 base rate
increase. See the  Fuel  section of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ) for a description and discussion of the net impact
of fuel on our operating results.       Operations       FedEx Express s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company s multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. In
addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, Fort Worth and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago.      Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Guangzhou, Cologne/Bonn and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major
sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Guangzhou, Paris, Cologne/Bonn and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional hubs
for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami   the Miami Gateway Hub   serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets.      Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station s
service area. In some international areas, independent agents ( Global Service Participants ) have been selected

 FedEx Express Segment.       FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. and Canadian
retail locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers and
corporate or industrial parks.       Fuel Supplies and Costs       During 2015, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these
contracts is purchased at market prices. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See  FedEx Express   Pricing.       The following table sets forth FedEx Express s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:   
   
    Most of FedEx Express s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.   
   Competition       As described in
Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ), the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. The
ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings.   
  Competitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. ( UPS ), passenger airlines
offering express package services, regional delivery concerns, air freight forwarders and the USPS. FedEx Express s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, TNT Express, foreign postal authorities, freight forwarders, passenger
airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Express s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating
conditions than FedEx Express.       Employees       David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2015, FedEx Express employed approximately 114,000
permanent full-time and approximately 52,000 permanent part-time employees, of which 13% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Express s international employees represent 37% of all employees.

Association, International ( ALPA ), and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. This agreement became amendable in March 2013, and the parties are currently in
negotiations. In October 2014, FedEx Express formally requested assistance from the National Mediation Board ( NMB ) to mediate the negotiations and the NMB has been actively mediating the talks since that time. The NMB is the U.S.
governmental agency that oversees labor agreements for entities covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the  RLA ). The conduct of mediated negotiations has no impact on our operations.   
  Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of FedEx Express employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing
attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative of FedEx Express employees (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express
or its employees. Certain of FedEx Express s non-U.S. employees are unionized. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent.        FedEx Trade Networks        FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services,
specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding. Specifically, FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade advisory services, including assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism
( C-TPAT ) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, publishes customs duty and tax information for over 180 customs areas worldwide. Additionally, FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for FedEx Express at its
major U.S. hub facilities.      As trade throughout the world grows, so does the FedEx Trade Networks solutions portfolio. Value-added services of
FedEx Trade Networks include 128 freight forwarding offices in 26 countries and Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. In addition, in 2015, FedEx Trade Networks strengthened its Latin America trade
lane services with enhanced shipping options to meet customer demand. The trade lanes include the following routes: Germany to Mexico, Germany to Brazil, Hong Kong to Mexico and U.S. to Mexico.   
  FedEx Trade Networks has approximately 5,000 employees and 150 offices in 128 service locations throughout North America and in Africa, Asia-Pacific,
Europe, India, Latin America and the Middle East. FedEx Trade Networks maintains a network of air and ocean freight-forwarding service providers and has entered into strategic alliances to provide services in certain countries in which it does not
have owned offices.        FedEx SupplyChain Systems        FedEx SupplyChain is an integrated logistics provider offering a range of supply chain solutions that leverage FedEx information technology and transportation networks around the world. The company offers

international payment options inclusive of language translation, shopping cart management, duty and tax calculations and credit card fraud protection. Bongo is headquartered in St. Petersburg,
Florida, and is a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks.       FedEx Ground Segment         FedEx Ground         Overview    
  By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx
Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on
business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is
also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers.   
  FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and
introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. FedEx Ground s ongoing network expansion program is substantially increasing the company s daily pickup capacity through the addition of new hubs featuring the
latest automated sorting technology, the expansion of existing hubs and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities.      The company
offers our FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such
as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee.

range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. By signing up at  fedex.com , customers can receive notification of FedEx Ground packages en route to their homes and can choose various delivery options.   
   Pricing       FedEx Ground periodically
publishes list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the
shipment to a FedEx account. As previously announced, on January 5, 2015, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery average list prices increased 4.9%.      In addition, as announced in May 2014, FedEx Ground began applying dimensional weight pricing to all shipments effective January 5, 2015. Previously, FedEx Ground applied dimensional weight pricing
only to packages measuring three cubic feet or greater. Dimensional weight pricing is a common industry practice that sets the transportation price based on package volume   the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual
weight.

   FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The surcharge
percentage is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for May 2015 was based on the average diesel
fuel price published for March 2015. Changes to the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points
may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. On February 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine the
fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground. See the  Fuel  section of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ) for a description and
discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.       Operations       FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of 547 facilities, including 33 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with
approximately 47,000 owner-operated vehicles and approximately 48,000 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home Delivery s
operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.      Advanced automated sorting
technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are
loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information.
FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website,  fedex.com . For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see  FedEx Services  
Customer-Driven Technology.       FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. and Canadian retail
locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the U.S.      As of May 31, 2015, FedEx
Ground had approximately 62,000 employees. In addition, FedEx Ground relies on independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground
delivery business and its customers. Henry J. Maier is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS, the USPS and regional delivery
carriers.       Independent Contractor Model       Although FedEx Ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (such as state tax or other administrative challenges) where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue, the
company believes its relationship with its contractors is generally excellent. For a description of these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ) and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.      FedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with the small businesses it contracts with that, among other
things, provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other compliance by the contractors. For example, FedEx Ground has implemented its Independent Service Provider ( ISP ) model in a number of states. The ISP model
requires pickup-and-delivery contractors based in those states to, among other things: (i) assume responsibility for the pickup-and-delivery operations of an entire

geographic service area that includes multiple routes, and (ii) negotiate independent agreements with FedEx Ground, rather than agree to a standard contract. To date, FedEx Ground has
transitioned to the ISP model in 17 states and is in the process of transitioning to the model in four additional states. Depending on a number of considerations, FedEx Ground may transition to it in other states as well.   
  In addition, because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx Ground only contracts with businesses that (i) are organized as
corporations registered and in good standing under applicable state law, and (ii) ensure that their personnel who provide services under an operating agreement with FedEx Ground are treated as their employees. FedEx Ground also has an ongoing
nationwide program to incentivize owners who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. During May 2015, approximately 93% of FedEx Ground s package volume was delivered by business owners operating multiple routes.   
    FedEx SmartPost        FedEx SmartPost
(a subsidiary of FedEx Ground) is a leading national small-parcel consolidator, which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the USPS for final delivery
to residences. The company picks up shipments from customers (including e-tailers and catalog companies), provides sorting and linehaul services and then delivers the packages to a USPS facility for final delivery by a postal carrier. Through its
network of 27 distribution hubs and approximately 9,000 employees, FedEx SmartPost provides delivery to all residential addresses in the U.S., including PO Boxes and military destinations.      On March 16, 2015, we announced that our FedEx SmartPost business will be merged into FedEx Ground effective September 1, 2015. The FedEx SmartPost service remains an important component of our
service offerings and this internal structural change will enhance our ability to leverage the strengths of both the FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost networks to maximize operational efficiencies and will provide greater flexibility to meeting the
needs of our e-commerce customers. There are no planned personnel reductions associated with this merger.        GENCO     
  On January 30, 2015, we acquired GENCO, a leading North American third-party logistics provider. With a comprehensive portfolio
of supply chain services, GENCO s expertise will expand existing FedEx service offerings in the evolving retail and e-commerce markets. GENCO s infrastructure and supply chain capabilities include reverse logistics, providing triage, test
and repair, remarketing and product liquidation solutions. Additionally, GENCO s breadth of expertise in targeted vertical markets   such as technology, healthcare and retail   aligns with our strategic priorities in these areas. With
more than 10,000 employees at approximately 150 facilities, GENCO offers a complete range of product lifecycle
logistics      services to customers in the technology, consumer, industrial, retail, and healthcare markets. GENCO
is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The financial results of this business are included in the FedEx Ground segment from the date of acquisition. GENCO has a small number of employees that are members of unions.

       FedEx Office        FedEx Office s network of digitally-connected locations offers access to copying and digital printing through retail and web-based platforms, signs and graphics, professional finishing, computer
rentals, and the full range of FedEx day-definite ground shipping and time-definite global express shipping services. FedEx Office s network of locations provides convenient access points to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services for higher
margin retail customers. Customers may also have their FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery packages delivered to any FedEx Office location nationwide by choosing the  Hold at FedEx Location  option when initiating a
shipment   or even when a shipment is on its way   free of charge. In addition, in 2014 FedEx Office introduced the FedEx Ship Get      pilot program, which is a shipping and delivery option available at select retail locations that allows customers to use stand-alone kiosks and lockers that are
managed electronically to ship or pick up packages at their convenience.      In addition, FedEx Office offers packing services, and packing
supplies and boxes are included in its retail offerings. By allowing customers to have items professionally packed by specially trained FedEx Office team members and then shipped using FedEx Ground day-definite shipping and time-definite global
FedEx Express shipping services, FedEx Office offers a complete  pack-and-ship  solution. In November 2014, FedEx Office rolled out a new packing feature, Pack Plus, which expanded FedEx Office s packing and shipping capabilities.
FedEx Pack Plus offerings include new custom box building capabilities and techniques, a more robust assortment of specialty boxes and additional packing supplies, equipment and tools to serve our customers  needs.   
  Almost all FedEx Office locations provide local pickup-and-delivery service for print jobs completed by FedEx Office. A FedEx courier picks up a
customer s print job at the customer s location and then returns the finished product to the customer. Options and services vary by location. Additionally, through cloud printing with FedEx Office Print Online, customers can upload files
from some of the most popular cloud websites including Box, Dropbox and Google Drive  and then select from a variety of printing options. Customers can choose to pick up their completed order at FedEx Office locations nationwide or have the
order delivered right to their door. Customers also have the ability to access these same cloud files through a USB drive or mobile device at self-serve copiers in FedEx Office locations, giving them seamless access to their files across our online
and retail channels. Lastly, FedEx SameDay City service is offered in more than 20 markets across the U.S., which allows customers to get their packages across town on the same day with local delivery by FedEx Office uniformed team members in
branded FedEx Office delivery vehicles.      As of May 31, 2015, FedEx Office operated approximately 1,800 customer facing centers, including
25 locations in Canada, as well as 31 closed production centers. FedEx Office is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.       Trademarks

    Regulation        Air . Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) and the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) exercise regulatory
authority over FedEx Express.      The FAA s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including
aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate
granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the
regulations.      In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the
minimum amount of rest time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including FedEx Express, were exempt from these
new pilot fatigue requirements, and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that
future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us.      The DOT s authority relates primarily to economic
aspects of air transportation. The DOT s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT,
authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.      Under the
Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx
Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative
requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.   
  FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ( CRAF ) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition
for military use certain of FedEx Express s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard
contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium
of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights.       Ground . The ground transportation performed
by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air
carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.   
         - 21 -

Table of Contents  

   The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently
regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.
     Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements
governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.   
   International . FedEx Express s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous
points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is
subject to the DOT s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and
services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are
subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments.      Our operations outside of the U.S., such as
FedEx Express s growing international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult and sometimes prohibit, the ability
of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.       Communication . Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications
Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express s activities pertaining to satellite communications.       Environmental . Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), is authorized to establish standards governing
aircraft noise. FedEx Express s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which
limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx
Express s significant markets. Congress s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints.
FedEx Express s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.      Concern
over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions.
For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a proposed finding on GHG emissions from aircraft and its relationships to air pollution. The final finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft
emissions. Additionally, in 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) for GHG emissions, to the airline industry. Under this decision, all FedEx Express flights that are
wholly within the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. For a description of such efforts and their
potential effect on our cost structure and operating results, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ).

   We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other
things, the shipment of dangerous goods, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Office s copy machines. Additionally, we are subject to
numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to
ensure compliance with these regulations.       Customs.  Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to
regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (air freight
forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.       Labor. 
All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the RLA, while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the  NLRA ). Under the RLA, groups that wish to
unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the NMB before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms.
This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation
process.      The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law
expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the
company in 1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA
ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.   
  The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees.
For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees
could disrupt the entire air/ground network. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these
potential labor law changes, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ).

The B757s are two-engine, narrow-bodied aircraft configured for cargo service.      

The ATR and Cessna 208 turbo-prop aircraft are leased to independent operators to support FedEx Express operations in areas where demand does not
justify use of a larger aircraft.         An inventory of spare engines and parts is maintained for each aircraft type.   
  In addition, FedEx Express leases smaller aircraft to operators, and these operators use the aircraft to move FedEx packages to and from airports served
by FedEx Express s larger jet aircraft. The lease agreements generally call for the lessee to provide the flight crews, maintenance, fuel and other supplies required to operate the aircraft, and FedEx Express reimburses the lessee for these
items. The lease agreements are for terms not exceeding one year and are generally cancelable upon 30 days  notice.

        MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND        FINANCIAL CONDITION          OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL SECTION       The financial section of the FedEx
Corporation ( FedEx ) Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report ) consists of the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ( MD A ), the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Other Financial Information, all of which include information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial
results. The following MD A describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity, capital resources, contractual cash obligations and critical accounting estimates of FedEx. The discussion in the financial section
should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, particularly  Item 1: Business  and our detailed discussion of risk factors included in this MD A.        ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION        Our MD A is composed of three major sections:
Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the following information:       

Results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2015 results compared to 2014 results, and 2014 results compared to 2013 results. This
section also includes a discussion of key actions and events that impacted our results, as well as our outlook for 2016.          

The overview is followed by a financial summary and analysis (including a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for 2016) for
each of our reportable transportation segments.          

Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations, including
a discussion of our cash flows and our financial commitments.          

Critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are important to understanding certain of the material
judgments and assumptions incorporated in our financial results.          

We conclude with a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may impact our financial condition and operating results.      
    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS        We
provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies are Federal
Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ), the world s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and
FedEx Freight, Inc. ( FedEx Freight ), a leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx
Services ), form the core of our reportable segments.      Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology,
communications and certain back-office support to our transportation segments. In addition, the FedEx Services segment provides customers with retail access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services through FedEx Office and Print Services,
Inc. ( FedEx Office ), and provides customer service, technical support and billing and collection services through FedEx TechConnect, Inc. ( FedEx TechConnect ). See  Reportable Segments  for further discussion and
refer to  Item 1: Business  for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies.   
         - 39 -

Table of Contents  

   The key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:   

the overall customer demand for our various services based on macro-economic factors and the global economy;      

the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight;

the mix of services purchased by our customers;          

the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per hundredweight and shipment for LTL
freight shipments);          

our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to match shifting volume levels; and

the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges.
        The majority of our operating expenses are directly impacted by revenue and volume levels. Accordingly, we expect these
operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent with changes in revenues and volumes. Therefore, the discussion of operating expense captions focuses on the key drivers and trends impacting expenses other than changes in
revenues and volume. The line item  Other operating expenses  includes costs predominantly associated with outside service contracts (such as security and facility services), insurance, professional fees, uniforms and advertising.
     Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 or ended May 31 of the year
referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. References to our transportation segments include, collectively, our FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments.

      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
    CONSOLIDATED RESULTS     
    Retirement Plans Mark-to-Market Adjustment        On June 12, 2015, we announced a change in our accounting method for recognizing actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. This method of
accounting is referred to as  mark-to-market  or MTM accounting. Historically, we have recognized actuarial gains and losses, subject to a corridor, by amortizing them into operating results over the average future service period of active
employees in these plans. We have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our consolidated operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. This change will provide greater transparency into operating results
by more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate conditions on plan obligations, investments and assumptions. The actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of May 31 and, accordingly, are recorded during the
fourth quarter. In addition, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets, we will no longer use an averaging technique permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for the market-related value of
plan assets but instead will use actual fair value of plan assets. We have applied these changes retrospectively.      Our operating segment
results follow internal management reporting, which is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Historically, total net periodic benefit cost was allocated to each segment. We will continue to record service cost, interest cost
and expected return on plan assets at the business segments. Annual recognition of actuarial gains and losses (the  MTM adjustment ) will be reflected in our segment results only at the corporate level.   
  Additionally, although the actual asset returns of our funded plans are recognized in each fiscal year through the MTM adjustment, we continue to
recognize an expected return on assets ( EROA ) in the determination of net pension cost. At the segment level, we have set our EROA at 6.5% for all periods presented, with an offsetting credit at the corporate level to reflect the
consolidated EROA in each period. We have set our consolidated EROA assumption at 6.5% for 2016.

   The following tables compare summary operating results and changes in revenues and operating income (dollars

segment 2015 expenses include impairment and related charges of $276 million resulting from the decision to permanently retire and adjust the retirement schedule of certain aircraft and related engines. Operating expenses for 2013 include $405

segment 2013 operating expenses include $50 million of direct and allocated business realignment costs.          

(4)   
        Operating income
includes a loss of $2.2 billion in 2015, a loss of $15 million in 2014 and a gain of $1.4 billion in 2013 associated with our mark-to-market pension accounting further discussed in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Operating income in 2015 also includes a $197 million charge in the fourth quarter to increase the legal reserve associated with the settlement of a legal matter at FedEx Ground to the amount of the settlement, which is further discussed in Note 18
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.           Overview     
  Our results for 2015 include a $2.2 billion loss ($1.4 billion, net of tax, or $4.81 per diluted share) associated with our fourth quarter mark-to-market
benefit plans adjustment. In addition, we recorded impairment and related charges of $276 million ($175 million, net of tax, or $0.61 per diluted share) associated with aircraft and engine retirements at FedEx Express, and a $197 million ($133
million, net of tax, or $0.46 per diluted share) charge in the fourth quarter to increase the legal reserve associated with the settlement of a legal matter at FedEx Ground to the amount of the settlement. These items are further described below in
this MD A. While these charges significantly impacted our results, each of our transportation segments had strong performance during 2015. All of our transportation segments experienced higher volumes, coupled with improved yields at FedEx
Ground and FedEx Freight. In addition, our results benefited from our profit improvement program commenced in 2013, the positive net impact of fuel, and a lower year-over-year impact from severe winter weather. Our 2015 results include higher
maintenance expense, primarily due to the timing of aircraft maintenance events at FedEx Express, and higher incentive compensation accruals, which were not affected by the mark-to-market accounting adoption, the aircraft impairment or the legal
reserve adjustment described above.      In 2015, we repurchased an aggregate of $1.3 billion of our common stock through open market purchases.
Share repurchases in 2015 had a $0.14 year-over-year positive impact on earnings per diluted share (net of interest expense on debt used to fund a portion of the program). See additional information on the share repurchase program in Note 1 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.      Our revenues for 2014 increased due to improved performance of all our transportation
segments. In addition, our 2014 results benefited from our voluntary employee severance program and reduced variable incentive compensation, partially offset by the significant negative net impact of fuel, an estimated $70 million year-over-year
negative impact of severe weather and one fewer operating day. Our year-over-year earnings comparisons benefited from the inclusion in 2013 results of business realignment costs and an aircraft impairment charge.   
  In 2014, we repurchased an aggregate of $4.9 billion of our common stock through open market purchases and through accelerated share repurchase
( ASR ) agreements with two banks. Share repurchases in 2014 had a modest positive impact on earnings per diluted share. See additional information on the share repurchase program in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

   In 2013, we incurred a noncash pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $1.4 billion from actuarial adjustments to
pension and postretirement healthcare plans related to the measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which resulted in a positive impact to our earnings of $2.63 per diluted share. In addition, we recorded business realignment costs of $560
million, primarily related to our voluntary cash buyout program, and we retired from service 10 aircraft and related engines, which resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of $100 million. These items negatively impacted our earnings by $1.31
per diluted share.

   The following graphs for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight show selected yield trends for the
years ended May 31:         

Revenue        Revenues increased 4% in 2015 due to improved performance at all our transportation segments. At FedEx Ground, revenues increased 12% in 2015 due to higher volume from continued growth in both our FedEx
Home Delivery service and commercial business, the inclusion of GENCO Distribution System, Inc. ( GENCO ) results from the date of acquisition and increased yields. At FedEx Freight, revenues increased 8% in 2015 primarily due to higher
average daily shipments and revenue per shipment. Revenues at FedEx Express were flat during 2015 due to U.S. domestic and international package volume growth, which were offset by lower fuel surcharges and the negative impact of exchange rates.
     Revenues increased 3% in 2014, primarily due to higher volumes at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight and yield increases at FedEx Ground.
Revenues at all of our transportation segments in 2014 were negatively impacted by one fewer operating day and unusually severe weather. At our FedEx Ground segment, revenues increased 10% in 2014 due to higher volume from market share gains and
increased yields as a result of rate increases. Revenues at FedEx Freight increased 7% during 2014 primarily due to higher average daily LTL shipments and revenue per LTL shipment. At FedEx Express, revenues were flat as lower fuel surcharges and
lower freight revenue were offset by revenue growth in our base U.S. and international export package business and growth in our freight-forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks. The demand shift from our priority international services to our
economy international services dampened revenue growth at FedEx Express.

     Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments        We incurred noncash pre-tax mark-to-market losses of $2.2 billion in 2015 ($1.4 billion, net of tax, or $4.81 per diluted share) and $15 million in 2014 ($9 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted
share) and a $1.4 billion gain in 2013 ($835 million, net of tax, or $2.63 per diluted share) from actuarial adjustments to pension and postretirement healthcare plans related to the measurement of plan assets and liabilities. For more information
see further discussion in the  Critical Accounting Estimates  section of this MD A and Note 1 and Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.        Business Realignment, Impairment and Other Charges        In May 2015, we made the
decision to retire from service seven Boeing MD11 aircraft and 12 related engines, four Airbus A310-300 aircraft and three related engines, three Airbus A300-600 aircraft and three related engines and one Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and three related
engines and related parts, and adjusted the retirement schedule of an additional 23 aircraft and 57 engines. As a consequence of this decision, impairment and related charges of $276 million ($175 million, net of tax, or $0.61 per diluted share), of
which $246 million was noncash, were recorded in the fourth quarter. The decision to permanently retire these aircraft and engines aligns with FedEx Express s plans to rationalize capacity and modernize its aircraft fleet to more effectively
serve its customers. These combined changes will not have a material impact on our near-term depreciation expense.      In 2013, we recorded
business realignment costs of $560 million, primarily related to our voluntary cash buyout program. Furthermore, in 2013, we retired from service 10 aircraft and related engines, which resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of $100 million.
These items negatively impacted our earnings by $1.31 per diluted share.      See the  Long-lived Assets  section of our  Critical
Accounting Estimates  for additional discussion of our accounting for aircraft retirement decisions.        Legal Reserve Increase
       On June 12, 2015, we announced an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs in the FedEx Ground independent contractor
litigation that is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to settle the matter for $228 million. The settlement agreement has been filed with the court for approval. The settlement resolves claims dating
back to 2000 that concern a model that FedEx Ground no longer operates. As a consequence, a charge of $197 million ($133 million, net of tax, or $0.46 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 to increase the reserve for this
matter to the amount of the settlement. The charge is included in the caption  Other  in our consolidated statements of income. For further information see Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

the amount of the settlement.         Our operating expenses for 2015 include a $2.2 billion loss ($1.4 billion, net of tax)
associated with our mark-to-market pension accounting as described above. In addition, we recorded charges of $276 million ($175 million, net of tax) associated with the decision to permanently retire and adjust the retirement schedule of certain
aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express, and a $197 million ($133 million, net of tax) charge in the fourth quarter to increase the reserve associated with the settlement of an independent contractor proceeding at FedEx Ground to the amount of
the settlement. The settlement is further discussed in this MD A and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our 2015 operating expenses also increased primarily due to volume-related growth in salaries and employee
benefits and purchased transportation expenses, higher maintenance and repairs expense and higher incentive compensation accruals. However, operating margin benefited from revenue growth, our profit improvement program, which we commenced in 2013,
the net impact of fuel (as further described below) and a lower year-over-year impact from severe winter weather.      Operating expenses included
an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of 6% in 2015 due to the timing of merit increases for many of our employees at FedEx Express, additional staffing to support volume growth and higher incentive compensation accruals. These
factors were partially offset by the positive impact of our voluntary buyout program. Other expenses were driven 8% higher in 2015 due to the legal reserve increase discussed above and the inclusion of GENCO results. Purchased transportation costs
increased 6% in 2015 due to volume growth and higher service provider rates at FedEx Ground and volume growth, higher utilization and higher service provider rates at FedEx Freight. The timing of aircraft maintenance events at FedEx Express
primarily drove an increase in maintenance and repairs expense of 13% in 2015.      Our 2014 operating expenses grew due to the volume-related
growth and higher utilization of third-party providers in purchased transportation expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense due to the accelerated depreciation on certain aircraft at FedEx Express (as further described below) and the
year-over-year impact of unusually severe weather. These factors were partially offset by the inclusion in 2013 of costs associated with our business realignment program, an aircraft impairment charge, as well as lower fuel expense, one fewer
operating day and lower maintenance and repairs expense.      Purchased transportation costs increased 10% in 2014 due to volume growth at FedEx
Ground, higher utilization of third-party transportation providers at FedEx Express, including recent business acquisitions at FedEx Express, higher utilization of third-party transportation providers at FedEx Freight and the expansion of our
freight-forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks.   
         - 48 -

Table of Contents  

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 8% in 2014 primarily due to accelerated depreciation on certain aircraft scheduled for retirement, and aircraft placed in service at FedEx Express
($74 million). Salaries and employee benefits expense in 2014 increased 1% due to the benefits from our voluntary employee buyout program, lower pension expense, the delayed timing or absence of merit increases for many of our employees and reduced
variable incentive compensation. Maintenance and repairs decreased 2% in 2014 due to network adjustments at FedEx Express and the continued modernization of our aircraft fleet, which impacted the timing of certain maintenance events.   
    Fuel        The following graph for
our transportation segments shows our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the years ended May 31:       

Fuel expense decreased 18% during 2015 primarily due to lower aircraft fuel prices. However, fuel prices represent
only one component of the two factors we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business. Consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect. Accordingly, we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel
on our results, which is a comparison of the year-over-year change in these two factors, is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business. In order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and
yield growth, we have included the comparative weighted-average fuel surcharge percentages in effect for 2015, 2014 and 2013 in the accompanying discussions of each of our transportation segments.   
  The index used to determine the fuel surcharge percentage for our FedEx Freight business adjusts weekly, while our fuel surcharges for the FedEx Express
and FedEx Ground businesses incorporate a timing lag of approximately six to eight weeks before they are adjusted for changes in fuel prices. For example, the fuel surcharge index in effect at FedEx Express in May 2015 was set based on March 2015
fuel prices. In addition, the structure of the table that is used to determine our fuel surcharge at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground does not adjust immediately for changes in fuel price, but allows for the fuel surcharge revenue charged to our
customers to remain unchanged as long as fuel prices remain within certain ranges.      Beyond these factors, the manner in which we purchase fuel
also influences the net impact of fuel on our results. For example, our contracts for jet fuel purchases at FedEx Express are tied to various indices, including the U.S. Gulf Coast index. While many of these indices are aligned, each index may
fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel. Furthermore, under these contractual arrangements, approximately 75% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week, with the remainder
of our purchases tied to the index price for the preceding month, rather than based on daily spot rates. These contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.

   Because of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of
fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term.   
  We routinely review our fuel surcharges and our fuel surcharge methodology. On February 2, 2015, we updated the tables used to determine our fuel
surcharges at FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight.      The net impact of fuel had a significant benefit to operating income in 2015.
This was driven by decreased fuel prices during 2015 versus the prior year, which was partially offset by the year-over-year decrease in fuel surcharge revenue during these periods.      The net impact of fuel on our operating results does not consider the effects that fuel surcharge levels may have on our business, including changes in demand and shifts in the mix of services purchased
by our customers. While fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield.
Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price and extra service charges we obtain for these services and the level of pricing discounts offered.      Fuel expense decreased 4% during 2014 primarily due to lower average price per gallon of jet fuel and lower aircraft fuel usage. The net impact of fuel had a significant negative impact on operating
income in 2014. This was driven by decreased fuel surcharge revenue during 2014 versus prior year, which was slightly offset by the year-over-year decrease in fuel prices.        Interest Expense        Interest expense increased $75 million in 2015 primarily due to
increased interest expense from our January 2015 debt offering and 2014 debt issuances. Interest expense increased $78 million in 2014 primarily due to increased interest expense from our January 2014 debt offering, 2013 debt issuances and a
reduction in capitalized interest.        Income Taxes        Our effective tax rate was 35.5% in 2015, 36.5% in 2014 and 37.4% in 2013. Due to its effect on income before income taxes, the adoption of MTM accounting reduced our 2015 effective tax rate by 80 basis
points and increased our effective tax rates by 20 basis points in 2014 and 100 basis points in 2013. Our permanent reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries provided a benefit of approximately $48
million to our 2015 provision for income taxes. Our cumulative permanently reinvested foreign earnings were $1.9 billion at the end of 2015 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2014.      For 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 36.0% and 37.0% prior to any year-end MTM adjustment. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source
of operating income and the impact of the MTM adjustment.      Additional information on income taxes, including our effective tax rate
reconciliation, liabilities for uncertain tax positions and our global tax profile can be found in Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.        Business Acquisitions        On April 6, 2015, we entered into a conditional
agreement to acquire TNT Express N.V. ( TNT Express ) for  4.4 billion (currently, approximately $4.9 billion). This combination is expected to expand our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, lower our costs to serve our European
markets by increasing density in our pickup-and-delivery operations and accelerate our global growth. This acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2016. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary
conditions, including obtaining all necessary approvals and competition clearances. We expect to secure all relevant competition approvals.

During 2015, we acquired two businesses, expanding our portfolio in e-commerce and supply chain solutions. On January 30, 2015, we acquired GENCO, a leading North American third-party
logistics provider, for $1.4 billion, which was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our January 2015 debt issuance. The financial results of this business are included in the FedEx Ground segment from the date of acquisition.   
  In addition, on December 16, 2014, we acquired Bongo International, LLC ( Bongo ), a leader in cross-border enablement technologies and
solutions, for $42 million in cash from operations. The financial results of this business are included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of acquisition.      In 2014, we expanded the international service offerings of FedEx Express by completing our acquisition of the businesses operated by our previous service provider, Supaswift (Pty) Ltd., in seven
countries in Southern Africa, for $36 million in cash from operations. The financial results of this business are included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of acquisition.      In 2013, we completed our acquisitions of Rapid o Cometa Log stica e Transporte S.A., a Brazilian transportation and logistics company, for $398 million; TATEX, a French express
transportation company, for $55 million; and Opek Sp. z o.o., a Polish domestic express package delivery company, for $54 million. The financial results of these businesses are included in the FedEx Express segment from their respective date of
acquisition.      The financial results of these acquired businesses were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our results of
operations and therefore, pro forma financial information has not been presented.        Profit Improvement Programs     
  During 2013, we announced profit improvement programs primarily through initiatives at FedEx Express and FedEx Services targeting annual profitability
improvement of $1.6 billion at FedEx Express. Our plans position FedEx Express to exit 2016 with a run rate of $1.6 billion in additional operating profit from the then 2013 base business. Our ability to achieve the profit improvement target and
other benefits from these programs is dependent upon a number of factors, including the health of the global economy and future customer demand.      In 2015 we made substantial progress in achieving our profit improvement goals. FedEx Express has improved operating income by approximately 70% from 2013 with essentially flat revenue during the
three-year period. FedEx Services has reduced its total expenses while investing in major information technology transformation projects. In addition, our incentive compensation programs have been gradually reinstated so that 2016 business plan
objectives represent more fully funded compensation targets.      During 2014, we completed a program to offer voluntary cash buyouts to eligible
U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. As a result of this program, approximately 3,600 employees left the company. We recognized costs of $560 million ($353 million, net of tax, or $1.11 per diluted share) during 2013, which were related
primarily to severance when eligible employees accepted their offers. Payments under this program were made at the time of departure and totaled approximately $300 million in 2014 and $180 million in 2013.   
  The cost of the program is included in the caption  Business realignment, impairment and other charges  in our consolidated statements of
income. Also included in that caption are other external costs directly attributable to our business realignment activities, such as professional fees. See Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the
voluntary employee severance program.      In addition, see the  Long-lived Assets  section of our  Critical Accounting
Estimates  for a discussion of fleet modernization actions taken in 2015 and 2013.

     Outlook        We anticipate revenue and earnings growth in 2016, prior to any year-end MTM adjustment, driven by continued improvements in the performance of all of our transportation segments, including the continued
execution of the profit improvement programs noted above. We expect continued moderate global economic growth to drive volume and yield improvements. Our expectations for earnings growth in 2016 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel
prices and global economic conditions. Our outlook for 2016 does not contemplate any impact from our announced intent to acquire TNT Express, such as integration planning or transaction costs or the operating activities of TNT Express if the
transaction is consummated.      Our capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to approximate $4.6 billion for continued expansion of the FedEx
Ground network and additional aircraft deliveries in 2016 to support our fleet modernization program at FedEx Express. We will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures generate
high returns on investments and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions. For additional details on key 2016 capital projects, refer to the  Capital Resources  and  Liquidity Outlook  sections of this
MD A.      Our outlook is dependent upon a stable pricing environment for fuel, as volatility in fuel prices impacts our fuel surcharge
levels, fuel expense and demand for our services. Volatility in fuel costs may impact earnings because adjustments to our fuel surcharges lag changes in actual fuel prices paid. Therefore, the trailing impact of adjustments to our fuel surcharges
can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term.      As described in Note 18 of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, we are involved in a number of lawsuits and other proceedings that challenge the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent contractors. FedEx Ground anticipates continuing changes to its
relationships with its owner-operators. As previously announced, FedEx Ground reached an agreement, which is subject to court approval, to settle an independent contractor case in California, and we accrued a related charge in the fourth
quarter of 2015. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2015, we established an accrual for the estimated probable loss in the Oregon cases that was required to be recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards. With respect to the
matters that are pending outside of California and Oregon, the nature, timing and amount of any changes are dependent on the outcome of numerous future events. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such changes or a
meaningful range of potential outcomes, although they could be material. However, we do not believe that any such changes will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx Ground business. See Note 18 of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for additional information.      See  Risk Factors  for a discussion of these and other potential
risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.        Seasonality of Business     
  Our businesses are cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenues and earnings. Historically, the U.S. express package business
experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia-to-U.S. market, peaks in October and November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season. Our first and third fiscal quarters,
because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. Normally, the fall is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground, while late December, June and July are the
slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of December through February is the slowest period. For FedEx Office, the summer months are normally the slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating
costs and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter.

       RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE     
  New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements.
     On June 1, 2013, we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) requiring
additional information about reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income, including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other
comprehensive income. We have adopted this guidance by including expanded accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirements in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements.      On May 28, 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (and International Financial Reporting Standards), which has been subsequently updated to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. This standard will be
effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019. The fundamental principles of the new guidance are that companies should recognize revenue in a manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of services to customers and the amount of revenue recognized
reflects the consideration that a company expects to receive for the goods and services provided. The new guidance establishes a five-step approach for the recognition of revenue. Based on our preliminary assessment, we do not anticipate that the
new guidance will fundamentally change our revenue recognition policies, practices or systems.      We believe that no other new accounting
guidance was adopted or issued during 2015 that is relevant to the readers of our financial statements. However, there are numerous new proposals under development which, if and when enacted, may have a significant impact on our financial reporting.

       REPORTABLE SEGMENTS     
  FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, form the core of our reportable segments.
Our reportable segments include the following businesses:       

FedEx Express Segment   
      
    FedEx Express (express transportation)  
  FedEx Trade Networks (air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage)  
  FedEx SupplyChain Systems (logistics services)  
  Bongo (cross-border enablement technology and solutions)    

FedEx Ground Segment   
      
    FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)  
  FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator)  
  GENCO (third-party logistics)    

FedEx Freight Segment   
      
    FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)  
  FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation)    

FedEx Services Segment   
      
    FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office
functions)     FedEx TechConnect (customer service, technical support, billings and
collections)     FedEx Office (document and business services and package acceptance)    
        FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT        The operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying consolidated financial statements of our transportation segments reflects the allocations from the FedEx Services
segment to the respective transportation segments. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenues or estimated services provided.      The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our transportation businesses, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment (including the net operating
results of FedEx Office) to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation businesses in the results of those segments. Within the FedEx Services segment allocation, the net operating results of FedEx Office, which are an immaterial component
of our allocations, are allocated to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment,
performance is evaluated based on the impact of its total allocated net operating costs on our transportation segments. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies are refined
periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.      During the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our method of accounting for
our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of these plans in earnings in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. This method of accounting is
referred to as MTM accounting as described in this MD A and Note 1 and Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. FedEx s segment operating results follow internal management reporting, which is used for making operating
decisions and assessing performance. Historically, total net periodic benefit cost was allocated to each segment. We continue to record service cost, interest cost and EROA at the business segments as well as an allocation from FedEx Services of
their comparable costs. Annual recognition of actuarial gains and losses will be reflected in our segment results only at the corporate level. Additionally, although the actual asset returns are recognized in each fiscal year through a MTM
adjustment, we continue to recognize EROA in the determination of net pension cost. At the segment level, we have set our EROA at 6.5% for all periods presented, which will equal our consolidated EROA assumption for 2016. In fiscal years where
  
         - 54 -

Table of Contents  

the consolidated EROA is greater than 6.5%, that difference is reflected as a credit in  Corporate, eliminations and other.  We have adjusted prior-period segment information to conform
to the current period s presentation to ensure comparability of the segment results across all periods, including comparisons going forward in 2016.      In addition, in 2015, we ceased allocating to our transportation segments the costs associated with our corporate headquarters division. These costs included services related to general oversight
functions, including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions as well as our annual MTM adjustment and certain other charges or credits. This change allows for additional transparency and improved management of our corporate
oversight costs. These costs were previously included in the operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying unaudited financial summaries of our transportation segments. These costs are now included in
 Corporate, eliminations and other  in our segment reporting and reconciliations. Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to the current year segment presentation. See Note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for more information. The increase in these unallocated costs in 2015 from the prior year was driven by a loss associated with our MTM adjustment as further discussed in this MD A and Note 1 and Note 13 of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and an increase in legal contingency reserves recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2015 associated with a legal matter at FedEx Ground described in Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.        OTHER INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS        Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we
believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenues and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are
not separately identified in the following segment information, because the amounts are not material.

       FedEx Express total revenues were flat in 2015 as U.S. and international package volume and base yield growth were offset by lower
fuel surcharges and unfavorable exchange rates.      U.S. domestic volumes increased 4% in 2015 driven by both our overnight box and deferred
service offerings. U.S. domestic yields decreased 2% in 2015 due to the negative impact of lower fuel surcharges, which were partially offset by higher rates. International export volumes grew 1%, driven by a 4% growth in our international economy
service offering. The 2% decrease in international export yields in 2015 was due to the negative impact of lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable exchange rates, which were partially offset by higher rates and weight per package. International
domestic revenues declined 3% in 2015 due to the negative impact of unfavorable exchange rates, which were partially offset by a 4% volume increase.      FedEx Express segment revenues were also flat in 2014. Lower fuel surcharges, lower freight revenue, unfavorable exchange rates and one fewer operating day were offset by revenue growth in our U.S. and
international export package base business and the growth of our freight-forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks. In addition, the demand shift from our priority international services to our economy international services dampened revenue
growth.

Table of Contents  

   Freight yields decreased 7% in 2014 due to lower fuel surcharges and lower rates. Freight average daily
pounds decreased by 1% in 2014 due to weakness in global economic conditions and capacity reductions. U.S. domestic yields increased 1% in 2014 primarily due to higher rates and weight per package, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges.
International export package revenues increased 1% in 2014 as base business growth was offset by lower fuel surcharges and the demand shift to our lower-yielding economy services. International priority yields increased 1% in 2014, while
international priority volumes declined 3%. Within this category, volumes for lower-yielding distribution services declined, while international priority volumes, excluding these distribution services, increased 1%. International domestic average
daily volumes increased 4% in 2014 primarily due to prior year international business acquisitions.      Our U.S. domestic and outbound fuel
surcharge and the international fuel surcharges ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:       
    On February 2, 2015, FedEx Express updated the tables used to determine fuel surcharges. On September 16, 2014,
FedEx Express announced a 4.9% average list price increase for FedEx Express U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services effective January 5, 2015. In January 2014, we implemented a 3.9% average list price increase for FedEx Express
U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services.        FedEx Express Segment Operating Income     
  Despite flat revenues, FedEx Express operating income and operating margin increased in 2015, driven by U.S. domestic and international package base
yield and volume growth, benefits associated with our profit improvement program, the positive net impact of fuel, reduced pension expense, lower international expenses due to currency exchange rates, lower depreciation expense and a lower
year-over-year impact from severe winter weather. These factors were partially offset by higher maintenance expense and higher incentive compensation accruals. Additionally, results for 2015 were negatively impacted by $276 million ($175 million,
net of tax) of impairment and related charges, of which $246 million was noncash, resulting from the decision to permanently retire and adjust the retirement schedule of certain aircraft and related engines.   
  Within operating expenses, salaries and employee benefits increased 3% in 2015 due to the timing of annual merit increases for many of our employees and
higher incentive compensation accruals. These factors were partially offset by the benefits from our voluntary employee severance program and lower pension expense. Maintenance and repairs expense increased 15% in 2015 primarily due to the timing of
aircraft maintenance events. Costs associated with the growth of our freight-forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks drove an increase in purchased transportation costs of 1% in 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 2% in 2015
driven by the expiration of accelerated depreciation for certain aircraft that were retired from service during the year.      Fuel expense
decreased 19% in 2015 due to lower aircraft fuel prices. The net impact of fuel had a significant benefit in 2015 to operating income. See the  Fuel  section of this MD A for a description and additional discussion of the net impact of
fuel on our operating results.

Table of Contents  

   FedEx Express operating income and operating margin in 2014 were positively impacted by the inclusion in
2013 of costs associated with our business realignment program and an aircraft impairment charge as discussed above. In addition, FedEx Express results in 2014 benefited from the revenue growth in our U.S. and international export package business,
lower pension expense, our voluntary employee severance program and lower maintenance expense. These factors were partially offset by lower freight revenues, a significant negative net impact of fuel and higher depreciation expense. In addition,
operating income in 2014 reflects one fewer operating day and the year-over-year negative impact of severe weather.      In 2014, salaries and
employee benefits were flat due to lower pension expense, the delayed timing or absence of annual merit increases for many of our employees, benefits from our voluntary employee severance program and lower variable incentive compensation.
Intercompany charges decreased 15% in 2014 due to the inclusion in the prior year results of costs associated with the business realignment program at FedEx Services, as well as lower allocated sales and information technology costs. FedEx Express
maintenance and repairs costs decreased 5% in 2014 due to network reductions and the benefits from the retirement of aircraft and related engines, as well as the timing of major maintenance events. Purchased transportation costs increased 8% in
2014 due to higher utilization of third-party transportation providers, including recent business acquisitions, and costs associated with the expansion of our freight-forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks. Depreciation and amortization expense
increased 10% during 2014 as a result of $74 million of year-over-year incremental accelerated depreciation due to the shortened life of certain aircraft scheduled for retirement, and aircraft placed into service.   
  Fuel costs decreased 5% in 2014 due to lower aircraft fuel prices and usage. The net impact of fuel had a significant negative impact on operating income
in 2014. See the  Fuel  section of this MD A for a description and additional discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.        FedEx Express Segment Outlook        We expect revenues and earnings to increase at FedEx
Express during 2016 primarily due to improved U.S. domestic and international export volume and package yields, as we continue to focus on revenue quality while managing costs. In addition, we expect operating income to improve through the continued
execution of our profit improvement programs, including managing network capacity to match customer demand, reducing structural costs, modernizing our fleet and driving productivity increases throughout our U.S. and international operations.
     Capital expenditures at FedEx Express are expected to increase in 2016 driven by our aircraft fleet modernization programs, as we add new
aircraft that are more reliable, fuel-efficient and technologically advanced and retire older, less-efficient aircraft.

       FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT     
  FedEx Ground service offerings include day-certain service delivery to businesses in the U.S. and Canada and to nearly 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx
SmartPost consolidates high-volume, low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages and utilizes the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) for final delivery. On January 30, 2015, we acquired GENCO, a leading North
American third-party logistics provider. GENCO s financial results are included in the following table from the date of acquisition, which has impacted the year-over-year comparability of revenue and operating expenses. The following tables
compare revenues, operating expenses, operating expenses as a percent of revenue, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions) and selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31, and

FedEx Ground Segment Revenues     
  FedEx Ground segment revenues increased 12% in 2015 due to volume and yield growth at FedEx Ground, the inclusion of GENCO results and yield growth at
FedEx SmartPost, partially offset by lower volumes at FedEx SmartPost.      Average daily volume at FedEx Ground increased 6% in 2015 due to
continued growth in our FedEx Home Delivery service and commercial business. Yield increased 3% in 2015 primarily due to higher dimensional weight charges and rate increases.      FedEx SmartPost average daily volume decreased 6% in 2015 due to the reduction in volume from a major customer. FedEx SmartPost yield increased 8% in 2015 due to rate increases and improved customer mix,
partially offset by higher postage costs. FedEx SmartPost yield represents the amount charged to customers net of postage paid to the USPS.   
  FedEx Ground segment revenues increased 10% in 2014 due to both volume and yield growth at FedEx Ground and volume growth at FedEx SmartPost. In
addition, 2014 revenues were negatively impacted by one fewer operating day, unusually severe weather and lower fuel surcharges.      Average
daily volume at FedEx Ground increased 9% during 2014 due to market share gains resulting from continued growth in our FedEx Home Delivery service and commercial business. FedEx Ground yield increased 2% during 2014 primarily due to rate increases
and higher residential surcharges, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue.      FedEx SmartPost volumes grew 6% during 2014 primarily
due to growth in e-commerce. Yields at FedEx SmartPost increased 1% during 2014 primarily due to rate increases and change in service mix, partially offset by higher postage costs and lower fuel surcharges.   
  The FedEx Ground fuel surcharge is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel, as published by
the Department of Energy. Our fuel surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:

Table of Contents  

   On February 2, 2015, FedEx Ground updated the tables used to determine fuel surcharges. On
September 16, 2014, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery announced a 4.9% increase in average list price effective January 5, 2015. In addition, as announced in May 2014, FedEx Ground began applying dimensional weight pricing to all
shipments effective January 5, 2015. In January 2014, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 4.9% increase in average list price. FedEx SmartPost rates also increased.        FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income        FedEx Ground segment operating income
increased 7% in 2015 driven by higher revenue per package and volumes, the positive net impact of fuel, and a lower year-over-year impact from severe winter weather. The increase to operating income was partially offset by higher network expansion
costs, as we continue to invest heavily in our FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost businesses. The decline in operating margin for 2015 is primarily attributable to network expansion costs and the inclusion of GENCO results.   
  The inclusion of GENCO results in the FedEx Ground segment results has impacted the year-over-year comparability of all operating expenses. Including the
incremental costs from GENCO, salaries and employee benefits increased 23% driven by additional staffing to support volume growth. Volume growth and higher service provider rates drove purchased transportation expense to increase 8% in 2015. Other
expense increased 24% in 2015 primarily due to the addition of GENCO results and higher self-insurance costs. Network expansion caused rentals expense to increase 21% in 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 13% in 2015 due to
network expansion and trailer purchases.      FedEx Ground segment operating income increased 9% in 2014 driven by higher volumes and yields.
Operating income comparisons were also positively impacted by the inclusion in 2013 of costs associated with our business realignment program. The increase to operating income in 2014 was partially offset by higher network expansion costs, as we
continue to invest heavily in the growing FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost businesses, and the net negative impact of fuel. In addition, operating income in 2014 was negatively affected by year-over-year impact of unusually severe weather and one
fewer operating day. The decline in operating margin for 2014 is primarily attributable to the negative net impact of fuel and network expansion costs. Operating margin in 2014 benefited from the inclusion in 2013 of costs associated with our
business realignment program.      Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 11% during 2014 primarily due to additional staffing to
support volume growth and higher healthcare costs. Other expense increased 13% primarily due to higher self-insurance costs and credit card fees. Rentals expense increased 21% in 2014 due to network expansion. Depreciation and amortization expense
increased 8% in 2014 due to network expansion and trailer purchases.        FedEx Ground Segment Outlook     
  FedEx Ground segment revenues and operating income are expected to continue to grow in 2016, led by volume growth across all our major services due to
market share gains. We also anticipate yield growth to continue in 2016 through yield management programs, including our dimensional weight rating changes. However, the full-year impact of the GENCO acquisition will have a negative impact on FedEx
Ground operating margin in 2016 due to integration costs and the impact of intangible asset amortization arising from purchase accounting.   
  Capital expenditures at FedEx Ground are expected to increase in 2016 as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable FedEx Ground
network through facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of these investments on our cost structure will partially offset earnings growth in 2016.      On March 16, 2015, we announced that our FedEx SmartPost business will be merged into FedEx Ground effective September 1, 2015. The FedEx SmartPost service remains an important component of
our service offerings and this internal structural change will enhance our ability to leverage the strengths of both the FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost networks to maximize operational efficiencies and will provide greater flexibility to meeting
the needs of our e-commerce customers. No personnel reductions associated with this merger are expected, and the estimated cost of the merger activities is immaterial to our results.

Table of Contents  

   Effective June 1, 2015, we will begin recording revenues associated with FedEx SmartPost on a gross
basis including postal fees in revenues and expenses, versus our previous net treatment, due to operational changes occurring in 2016 which result in us being the principal in all cases for the FedEx SmartPost service. This change will be
prospective as the operational changes did not occur until the beginning of 2016. While we expect this to have a negative impact of approximately 120 basis points on the FedEx Ground operating margin in 2016, it will not impact the total operating
income of FedEx Ground.      We will continue to vigorously defend various attacks against our independent contractor model and incur ongoing
legal costs as a part of this process. While we believe that FedEx Ground s owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors, it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional material losses in connection with one or
more of these matters or be required to make material changes to our contractor model. However, we do not believe that any such changes will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx Ground business.

      FedEx Freight Segment Revenues     
  FedEx Freight segment revenues increased 8% in 2015 due to higher average daily shipments and revenue per shipment. Average daily LTL shipments increased
5% in 2015 due to higher demand for our FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service offerings. LTL revenue per shipment increased 3% in 2015 due to higher rates and higher weight per LTL shipment.   
  FedEx Freight segment revenues increased 7% during 2014 due to higher average daily LTL shipments and revenue per LTL shipment. Revenues in 2014 were
negatively impacted by one fewer operating day. Average daily LTL shipments increased 6% in 2014 due to higher demand for both of our service offerings. LTL revenue per shipment increased 1% in 2014 due to changes in shipment characteristics,
primarily higher weight per LTL shipment.      The weekly indexed LTL fuel surcharge is based on the average of the U.S. on-highway prices for a
gallon of diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy. The indexed LTL fuel surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:       
    On February 2, 2015, FedEx Freight updated the tables used to determine fuel surcharges. On September 16, 2014,
FedEx Freight announced a 4.9% average increase in certain U.S. and other shipping rates effective January 5, 2015. In June 2014, FedEx Freight increased its published fuel surcharge indices by three percentage points. In March 2014, FedEx
Freight increased certain U.S. and other shipping rates by an average of 3.9%.        FedEx Freight Segment Operating Income
       FedEx Freight segment operating income and operating margin increased in 2015 due to higher LTL revenue per shipment and higher
average daily LTL shipments. These factors were partially offset by a 10% increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, driven by staffing to support volume growth and higher incentive compensation accruals. Volume growth, higher utilization
and higher service provider rates drove an increase to purchased transportation expense of 7% in 2015. Other expense increased 9% in 2015 driven partially by higher cargo claims.

Table of Contents  

   FedEx Freight segment operating income and operating margin increased in 2014 due to the positive impacts of
higher average daily LTL shipments, higher LTL revenue per shipment and greater network efficiency. Operating income comparisons also benefited from the inclusion in 2013 of costs associated with our business realignment program as discussed below.
Operating income in 2014 was negatively impacted by higher depreciation and amortization expense, the negative year-over-year impact of severe weather and one fewer operating day.      Purchased transportation expense increased 13% in 2014 due to increased use of rail and road third-party transportation providers and higher rates. Salaries and employee benefits increased 5% in 2014
primarily due to a volume-related increase in labor hours and higher healthcare costs. Other operating expenses increased 11% in 2014 due to higher self-insurance costs, bad debt expense and real estate taxes. Intercompany charges decreased 5% in
2014 primarily due to the inclusion in the prior year results of costs associated with the business realignment program at FedEx Services, partially offset by higher allocated sales costs.        FedEx Freight Segment Outlook        We expect continued revenue and operating income
growth, as well as improvement in our operating margin during 2016 driven by moderate volume growth from our differentiated LTL services. We also anticipate effective yield management practices to result in increased revenues. FedEx Freight
earnings growth will also be positively impacted by continued improvement in productivity along with further investment in technology.   
  Capital expenditures at FedEx Freight are expected to increase in 2016 primarily driven by investments in vehicles, as well as additional investments in
facilities.

      FINANCIAL CONDITION    
      LIQUIDITY        Cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.8 billion at May 31, 2015, compared to $2.9 billion at May 31, 2014. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods ended
May 31 (in millions). All amounts have been recast to conform to the current year presentation reflecting the MTM accounting changes further discussed in this MD A and Note 1, Note 13 and Note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements:       
     Cash Provided by Operating Activities . Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.1 billion in 2015
primarily due to higher segment operating income, the inclusion in the prior year of payments associated with our voluntary employee buyout program and lower incentive compensation payments. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $424
million in 2014 primarily due to voluntary employee severance program payouts, an income tax refund received in the prior year, higher income tax payments and higher pension contributions, partially offset by higher segment operating income. We made
contributions of $660 million to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans ( U.S. Pension Plans ) in 2015 and 2014 and $560 million in 2013.       Cash Used in Investing Activities . Capital expenditures were 23% higher in 2015 largely due to increased spending for aircraft at FedEx Express and sort facility expansion at FedEx Ground, and were
5% higher in 2014 than in 2013, largely due to increased spending at FedEx Ground and FedEx Express. See  Capital Resources  for a more detailed discussion of capital expenditures during 2015 and 2014.

    Financing Activities . We had various senior unsecured debt issuances in 2015, 2014 and 2013. See Note
6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on these issuances. Interest on these notes is paid semiannually. We utilized $1.4 billion of the net proceeds of the 2015 debt issuance to fund our acquisition of GENCO
and the remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. We utilized the net proceeds of the 2014 debt issuance to finance the ASR agreements as discussed below. We utilized the net proceeds of the 2013 debt issuances for
working capital and general corporate purposes. See Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of business acquisitions.        During 2014, we repaid our $250 million 7.38% senior unsecured notes that matured on January 15, 2014. During 2013, we made principal payments of $116 million related to capital lease obligations and
repaid our $300 million 9.65% unsecured notes that matured in June 2012 using cash from operations.      The effect of exchange rate changes on
cash during 2015 was driven by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Brazilian real, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.   
  The following table provides a summary of our common stock share repurchases for the periods ended May 31 (dollars in millions, except per share
amounts):       
    As of May 31, 2015, 12.2 million shares remained under our share repurchase authorizations. Our share
repurchase activity in 2014 includes ASR agreements entered into with two banks to repurchase $2.0 billion of our common stock.      In 2015, our
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million shares of common stock. It is expected that the share authorization will primarily be utilized to offset equity compensation dilution over the next several years. Shares may be
repurchased under this program from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This is the only repurchase program that currently exists, and it does not have an expiration date.

       CAPITAL RESOURCES     
  Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities, and package-handling and
sort equipment. The amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including pre-existing contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical
expansion of services, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities.      The following table compares capital
expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the years ended May 31 (in millions):       
    Capital expenditures during 2015 were higher than the prior year primarily due to increased spending for aircraft at
FedEx Express and increased spending for sort facility expansion at FedEx Ground. Aircraft and related equipment purchases at FedEx Express during 2015 included the delivery of 14 Boeing 767-300 Freighter ( B767F ) and 13 Boeing 757
( B757 ) aircraft, as well as the modification of certain aircraft before being placed into service. Capital expenditures during 2014 were higher than the prior year primarily due to increased spending for sort facility expansion and
equipment at FedEx Ground and aircraft and related equipment at FedEx Express. Aircraft and related equipment expenditures at FedEx Express during 2014 included the delivery of 17 B757 aircraft, four B767F aircraft and two Boeing 777 Freighter
( B777F ) aircraft, as well as the modification of certain aircraft before being placed into service.   
      LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK        We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $3.8 billion at May 31, 2015, cash flow from operations and available financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs,
including working capital, capital expenditure requirements, debt payment obligations and our announced intent to acquire TNT Express. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2015 includes $478 million of cash in offshore jurisdictions
associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.   
  Our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $4.6 billion in 2016. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to
fund our increased capital expenditures in 2016, which will include spending for network expansion at FedEx Ground and aircraft modernization and re-fleeting at FedEx Express. We expect approximately 45% of capital expenditures in 2016 to be
designated for growth initiatives, predominantly at FedEx Ground, and 55% dedicated to maintaining our existing operations. Our expected capital expenditures for 2016 include $1.6 billion in investments for delivery of aircraft and progress payments
toward future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express.

Table of Contents  

   We have several aircraft modernization programs underway that are supported by the purchase of B777F, B767F
and B757 aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our
ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements. During September 2014, FedEx Express entered into an agreement to purchase four additional
B767F aircraft, the delivery of which will begin in 2017 and continue through 2019.      We have a shelf registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock.      We plan to finance the aggregate consideration of the announced intent to acquire TNT Express by utilizing available cash on our balance sheet and through available financing sources.   
  A $1 billion revolving credit facility is available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs and to provide support for the issuance of
commercial paper. The revolving credit agreement expires in March 2018. The agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt (long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus
six times our last four fiscal quarters  rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus total common stockholders  investment) that does not exceed 70%. Our leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital was 61% at May 31, 2015.
We believe the leverage ratio covenant is the only significant restrictive covenant in our revolving credit agreement. Our revolving credit agreement contains other customary covenants that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially
restrict the conduct of our business. We are in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant and all other covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do not expect the covenants to affect our operations, including our liquidity or expected
funding needs. As of May 31, 2015, no commercial paper was outstanding, and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit facility was available for future borrowings.      For 2016, we anticipate making contributions totaling $660 million (approximately $500 million of which are required) to our U.S. Pension Plans. Our U.S. Pension Plans have ample funds to meet expected
benefit payments.      On June 8, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock, an increase
of $0.05 per common share from the prior quarter s dividend. The dividend was paid on July 2, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 18, 2015. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and
approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year.   
  Standard   Poor s has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB and commercial paper rating of A-2 and a ratings outlook of
 stable.  Moody s Investors Service has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa1 and commercial paper rating of P-2 and a ratings outlook of  negative.  If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may
increase. If our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. If our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become limited.

       CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
       The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2015. Certain of these contractual
obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Except for the current portion of interest on long-term debt, this table does not
include amounts already recorded in our balance sheet as current liabilities at May 31, 2015. We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. These contingent liabilities are not included in the table below. We have other long-term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income taxes, qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement healthcare
plan liabilities and other self-insurance accruals. Unless statutorily required, the payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Accordingly, this table is
not meant to represent a forecast of our total cash expenditures for any of the periods presented.       
    Open purchase orders that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting
purposes and are not included in the table above. Such purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. See Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on such purchase
orders.       Operating Activities    
  In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, future contractual payments under our operating leases (totaling $16
billion on an undiscounted basis) are not recorded in our balance sheet. Credit rating agencies routinely use information concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. The amounts reflected in
the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (principally aircraft and facilities) with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2015. Under the proposed
new lease accounting rules, the majority of these leases will be required to be recognized on the balance sheet as a liability with an offsetting right-to-use asset.      The amounts reflected for purchase obligations represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or services that are not capital-related. Such contracts include those for printing and advertising and
promotions contracts.      Included in the table above within the caption entitled  Non-capital purchase obligations and other  is our
estimate of the current portion of the liability ($1 million) for uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the
long-term portion of the liability ($35 million) is excluded from the table. See Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

   We had $472 million in deposits and progress payments as of May 31, 2015 on aircraft purchases and
other planned aircraft-related transactions.       Investing Activities       The amounts reflected in the table above for capital purchase obligations represent noncancelable agreements to purchase capital-related equipment. Such contracts include those for certain purchases of
aircraft, aircraft modifications, vehicles, facilities, computers and other equipment. Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo transport unless we have entered
into noncancelable commitments to modify such aircraft.       Financing Activities       We have certain financial instruments representing potential commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby
letters of credit and surety bonds. These instruments are required under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the normal course of international operations. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected
in our balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves.   
  The amounts reflected in the table above for long-term debt represent future scheduled payments on our long-term debt. In 2016, we have no scheduled debt
payments.         CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES       The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts
reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the
appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new
or better information.      The estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve
the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.          RETIREMENT PLANS     
   OVERVIEW . We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans,
defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans and are described in Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.   The rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce tremendous volatility in our
results, financial condition and liquidity.       As described in the consolidated results section of this MD A, in 2015 we adopted MTM
accounting for recognition of actuarial gains and losses on our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans. Previously, we amortized actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor amount over the average remaining service lives
of our covered employees. Further, we used a calculated value method to determine the value of plan assets amortizing changes in the fair value of plan assets over a period no

longer than four years. Under our new MTM accounting methodology (as described in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements), we will immediately recognize changes in the fair
value of plan assets and actuarial gains or losses in our operating results annually in the fourth quarter each year. The remaining components of pension and postretirement healthcare expense, primarily service and interest costs and the expected
return on plan assets, will continue to be recorded on a quarterly basis.      We elected to adopt MTM accounting for a number of reasons.
Immediate recognition of gains and losses in the income statement is the preferred method of accounting for these plans as it aligns the income statement treatment with the treatment required to measure the related assets and liabilities in the
balance sheet. Furthermore, the accumulated actuarial losses relate primarily to the remeasurement of our legacy pension formula which has been frozen for the vast majority of employees since 2008. Due to persistently low interest rates and
demographic assumption changes, those accumulated losses have become increasingly material and amortizing them into future periods would punitively burden future operations for legacy benefit costs.   
  We are required to record year-end adjustments to our financial statements on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement
healthcare plans. The funded status of our plans also impacts our liquidity; however, the cash funding rules operate under a completely different set of assumptions and standards than those used for financial reporting purposes. As a result, our
actual cash funding requirements can differ materially from our reported funded status.      The  Salaries and employee benefits 
caption of our consolidated income statements includes expense associated with service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets. Our fourth quarter MTM adjustment is included in the  Retirement plans mark-to-market
adjustment  caption in our consolidated income statements. A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):       
    The components of the pre-tax mark-to-market losses (gains) are as follows, in millions:   
   
     2015    
  The implementation of new U.S. mortality tables in 2015 resulted in an increased participant life expectancy assumption, which increased the overall
projected benefit obligation by $1.2 billion. The weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans declined from 4.57% at May 31, 2014 to 4.38% at May 31, 2015.   
   2014       The actual rate of return on our
U.S. Pension Plan assets of 13.3% exceeded our expected return of 7.75% primarily due to a favorable investment environment for global equity markets. The weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans
decreased from 4.76% at May 31, 2013 to 4.57% at May 31, 2014.   
         - 74 -

Table of Contents  

    2013       The weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans increased from 4.44% at May 31, 2012 to 4.76% at May 31, 2013. The actual rate of return on our U.S.
Pension Plan assets of 12.1% exceeded our expected return of 8.0% primarily due to a favorable investment environment for global equity and credit markets.      Following is a discussion of the key estimates we consider in determining our U.S. Pension Plans cost:       DISCOUNT RATE . This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been accrued to date (the projected benefit obligation, or  PBO ) to their net
present value and to determine the succeeding year s ongoing pension expense (prior to any year-end MTM adjustment). The discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date. The discount rate at each measurement date is as
follows:       
    We determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of
high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better). In developing this theoretical portfolio, we select bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments, limit our concentration by industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to ensure bonds with a
call feature have a low probability of being called. To the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payments in a given period, the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one-year forward rates.   
  The discount rate assumption is highly sensitive. For our largest pension plan, at our May 31, 2015 measurement date, a 50-basis-point increase in
the discount rate would have decreased our 2015 PBO by approximately $1.7 billion and a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our 2015 PBO by approximately $1.9 billion. With the adoption of MTM accounting, the impact of
changes in the discount rate on pension expense are predominately isolated to our fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustment. A one-basis-point change in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have a $37 million effect on the fourth
quarter mark-to-market adjustment but only a net $100,000 impact on segment level pension expense.       PLAN ASSETS.  The expected average
rate of return on plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption. It is required to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in publicly tradeable securities, and our
pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. As part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status volatility, we have transitioned
to a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities.

   Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter,
which we review on an annual basis and revise as appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:       

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those
investment classes to earn over time; and          

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments
were made strictly in indexed funds.         For consolidated pension expense, we assumed a 7.75% expected long-term rate of return
on our U.S. Pension Plan assets in 2015 and 2014 and 8% in 2013. The actual returns during each of the last three fiscal years have exceeded those long-term assumptions. However, for 2016, we have lowered our expected return on plan assets
assumption for long-term returns on plan assets to 6.5% as we continue to implement our asset and liability management strategy. In lowering this assumption we considered our historical returns, our current capital markets outlook and our investment
strategy for our plan assets, including the impact of the duration of our plan liability. Our actual return on plan assets has contracted from 2014 as we have increased our asset allocation to lower yielding fixed income investments. At the segment
level, we have set our EROA at 6.5% for all periods presented.      A one-basis-point change in our expected return on plan assets impacts our
2016 segment pension expense by $2.3 million. The actual historical annual return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets, calculated on a compound geometric basis, was 6.7%, net of investment manager fees and administrative expenses, for the 15-year period
ended May 31, 2015 and 7%, net of investment manager fees and administrative expenses, for the 15-year period ended May 31, 2014. Any difference between actual plan asset performance and the expected return is reflected in our year-end MTM
adjustment each fiscal year.       FUNDED STATUS.  Following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans as of
May 31 (in millions):         
     FUNDING . The funding requirements for our U.S. Pension Plans are governed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006,
which has aggressive funding requirements in order to avoid benefit payment restrictions that become effective if the funded status determined under IRS rules falls below 80% at the beginning of a plan year. All of our U.S. Pension Plans have funded
status levels in excess of 80% and our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to our employees as they come due. Additionally, current benefit payments are nominal compared to our total plan assets (benefit payments for our U.S. Pension
Plans for 2015 were approximately $744 million or 3.2% of plan assets).      During 2015, we made $388 million in required contributions to our
U.S. Pension Plans. Over the past several years, we have made voluntary contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans in excess of the minimum required contributions. Amounts contributed in excess of the minimum required can result in a credit balance for
funding purposes that can be used to reduce minimum contribution requirements in future years. Our current credit balance exceeds $2.8 billion at May 31, 2015. For 2016, we anticipate making contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans totaling $660
million (approximately $500 million of which are required).

   See Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our
retirement plans.          SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS        We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers  compensation claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and
long-term disability programs. Our reserves are established for estimates of loss on reported claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. Self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet were $2.0 billion at May 31, 2015 and $1.8
billion at May 31, 2014. Approximately 41% of these accruals were classified as current liabilities.      Our self-insurance accruals are
primarily based on the actuarially estimated, cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include consideration of factors such as severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality and
plan designs. Cost trends on material accruals are updated each quarter. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based
on risk tolerance and premium expense. Historically, it has been infrequent that incurred claims exceeded our self-insured limits.      We believe
the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude
of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and
severity, insurance retention levels and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.   
      LONG-LIVED ASSETS         USEFUL LIVES AND SALVAGE VALUES . Our business is capital intensive, with approximately 56% of our total assets invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures.   
  The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires
management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our
estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and
other equipment. For our aircraft, we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these assets in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of
depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods
and could have a material impact on our results of operations (as described below). Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes
in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control.      In 2013, FedEx
Express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 76 aircraft and related engines to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network. In 2012, we shortened the depreciable lives for 54 aircraft and related engines to accelerate
the retirement of these aircraft, resulting in a depreciation expense increase of $69 million in 2013. As a result of these accelerated retirements, we incurred an additional $74 million in year-over-year accelerated depreciation expense in 2014.

    IMPAIRMENT . The FedEx Express global air and ground network includes a fleet of 647 aircraft
(including approximately 300 supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of U.S. and international shipping services. While certain aircraft are utilized in
primary geographic areas (U.S. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our
customers. Because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify
aircraft as needed.      Because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan
our fleet requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited
opportunities to acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. These activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand. Aircraft purchases (primarily aircraft in passenger configuration) that have not been
placed in service totaled $102 million at May 31, 2015 and $82 million at May 31, 2014. We plan to modify these assets in the future and place them into operations.      The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows do not
exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. We operate integrated transportation networks and, accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset
level for our analysis of impairment. Further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset. We make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from
service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to
sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. The fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft. Such
estimates are subject to revision from period to period.      In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and
engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation
expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, impaired) include, but
are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently
retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31, 2015, we had one aircraft temporarily idled. This aircraft has been idled for approximately two months and is expected to return to
revenue service.      In the fourth quarter of 2015, we retired from service seven Boeing MD11 aircraft and 12 related engines, four Airbus
A310-300 aircraft and three related engines, three Airbus A300-600 aircraft and three related engines and one Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and three related engines, and related parts. We also adjusted the retirement schedule of an additional 23 aircraft
and 57 engines. As a consequence, impairment and related charges of $276 million ($175 million, net of tax, or $0.61 per diluted share), of which $246 million was noncash, were recorded in the fourth quarter. The decision to permanently retire these
aircraft and engines aligns with FedEx Express s plans to rationalize capacity and modernize its aircraft fleet to more effectively serve its customers. These combined retirement changes will not have a material impact on our near-term
depreciation expense.      In 2013, we retired from service two Airbus A310-200 aircraft and four related engines, three Airbus A310-300 aircraft
and two related engines and five Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and 15 related engines, to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet and improve its global network. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge
of $100 million ($63 million, net of tax, or $0.20 per diluted share) was recorded in 2013. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.

    LEASES . We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities and equipment.
Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in  Contractual Cash Obligations  and Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, at May 31, 2015 we had approximately $16 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for payments under operating leases. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31,
2015 was approximately six years. The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet under current U.S. accounting rules.      The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic
useful life. In addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for
the owner-lessor or, in substance, the owner of the asset during the construction period. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to
assist us in making these evaluations.      Under a proposed revision to the accounting standards for leases, we would be required to record an
asset and a liability for our outstanding operating leases similar to the current accounting for capital leases. Notably, the amount we record in the future would be the net present value of our future lease commitments at the date of adoption. This
proposed guidance has not been issued and has been subjected to numerous revisions, most recently in May 2013. While we are not required to quantify the effects of the proposed rule changes until they are finalized, we believe that a majority of our
operating lease obligations reflected in the contractual cash obligations table would be required to be reflected in our balance sheet were the proposed rules to be adopted. Furthermore, our existing financing agreements and the rating agencies that
evaluate our creditworthiness already take our operating leases into account.       GOODWILL . As of May 31, 2015, we had $3.8 billion
of recorded goodwill from our business acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. During 2015 we recorded $1.1 billion in additional goodwill associated with our GENCO and
Bongo acquisitions. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefit from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business.   
  In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment, including comparing the fair
value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach) incorporating market participant considerations and
management s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating
results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. We perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter unless circumstances indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the tests.   
  Our reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office (reported in the FedEx Services
segment) and GENCO (reported in the FedEx Ground segment). We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values in 2015 and 2014, and
we do not believe that any of these reporting units were at risk as of May 31, 2015.          CONTINGENCIES
       We are subject to various loss contingencies, including tax proceedings and litigation, in connection with our operations. Contingent
liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further, additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which
these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for   
         - 79 -

Table of Contents  

these items based on the nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a
liability, if any. Our material pending loss contingencies are described in Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of matters not
specifically described in Note 18 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters.   
   TAX CONTINGENCIES . We are subject to income and operating tax rules of the U.S., its states and municipalities, and of the foreign jurisdictions
in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions, as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances and related deferred tax valuation allowances, if necessary, due to the complexity of these rules and
their interaction with one another. We account for income taxes by recording both current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, applied to taxable income, reduced by applicable tax credits.      Tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in
the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate and are impacted by several factors, including tax audits, appeals, litigation, changes in tax laws and other rules and their interpretations, and changes in our
business. We regularly assess the potential impact of these factors for the current and prior years to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions. We continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust our tax
positions, including the current and deferred tax liabilities, in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. In addition, management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax
consequences.      We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax
position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second
step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the
probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in
facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision.
     We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of
income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest
and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in the caption  Other liabilities  in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.      We account for operating taxes based on multi-state, local and foreign taxing jurisdiction rules in
those areas in which we operate. Provisions for operating taxes are estimated based upon these rules, asset acquisitions and disposals, historical spend and other variables. These provisions are consistently evaluated for reasonableness against
compliance and risk factors.      We measure and record operating tax contingency accruals in accordance with accounting guidance for
contingencies. As discussed below, this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated.   
         - 80 -

Table of Contents  

    OTHER CONTINGENCIES . Because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to other
legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims and FedEx Ground s owner-operators. Accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of
estimated loss from a contingency, such as a tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
This guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management s judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable.      During the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible or remote that a liability has been incurred. A loss is
recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. For unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be
reasonably estimated.      Our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition
of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. The process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled
meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters.   
  In determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other factors:   

the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding (i.e., the lengthy and complex nature of
class-action matters);          

the procedural status of each matter;          

any opportunities to dispose of a lawsuit on its merits before trial (i.e., motion to dismiss or for summary judgment);      

the amount of time remaining before a trial date;          

the status of discovery;          

the status of settlement, arbitration or mediation proceedings; and      

our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial.         In reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure, we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the information available prior to the
issuance of our financial statements. Uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency, including a conclusion that we are unable to
establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss. We update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements. However, events may arise that
were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss.      Despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies, we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the
potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure.         RISK FACTORS    
  Our financial and operating results are subject to many risks and uncertainties, as described below.   
    We are directly affected by the state of the economy.   While macro-economic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable.
The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods   key
macro-economic measurements. When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies   
         - 81 -

Table of Contents  

expand the number of distribution centers and move manufacturing closer to consumer markets, we transport goods shorter distances. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure,
which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Moreover, as we continue to grow our international business, we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy, the rate of growth of global trade and the typically
more volatile economies of emerging markets. In 2015, we saw a continued customer preference for slower, less costly shipping services.   
    Our businesses depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.   The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service,
reliability and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers and the
general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we devote significant resources to
promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors or agents, such as customer service mishaps or noncompliance with laws, could tarnish our reputation and reduce the
value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as YouTube and Twitter, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to defend against. Damage to our reputation and
loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our
brand.        We rely heavily on information and technology to operate our transportation and business networks, and any cybersecurity
incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations.   Our ability to attract and retain customers
and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business
information and the information provided by our customers. We are subject to risks imposed by cybersecurity incidents, which can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, to
sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us and our systems, customers or service providers. Additionally, risks such as code anomalies,  Acts of God,  transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our
FedEx enterprise automation platform, data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services and data.      Any disruption to
our complex, global technology infrastructure, including those impacting our computer systems and  fedex.com , could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information, adversely impact our customer service, volumes and
revenues or could lead to litigation or investigations, resulting in significant costs. These types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity or availability of company and customer information was compromised
due to a data loss by FedEx or a trusted third party. While we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from
cybersecurity incidents, technology disruptions or data loss, which could adversely impact our competitiveness and results of operations. Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures
could be significant.        Our transportation businesses are impacted by the price and availability of fuel.   We must purchase large
quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. To date, we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel costs
through our indexed fuel surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason, fuel
costs could adversely impact our operating results. Additionally, if fuel prices rise sharply, even if we increase our fuel surcharge, we could experience a lag time in implementing the surcharge, which could adversely affect our short-term
operating results. Even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higher-yielding express services to our lower-yielding deferred or ground

services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. In addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation
networks.        Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.   We make
significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, package handling facilities, sort equipment, copy equipment and other assets to support our transportation and business networks. We also make significant investments to rebrand, integrate
and grow the companies that we acquire. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. We must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually
needed. We must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. Overcapacity could
lead to asset dispositions or write-downs and undercapacity could negatively impact service levels.        We face intense
competition.   The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources
than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks.
In addition, some high volume package shippers are developing in-house ground delivery capabilities, which would in turn reduce our revenues and market share. We believe we compete effectively with these companies   for example, by providing
more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), but also to maintain or grow
our market share. While we believe we compete effectively through our current service offerings, if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or more effectively bundle their services or our current
customers become competitors, it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share.        If we do not successfully execute or
effectively operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses, our financial results and reputation may suffer.   Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent
strategic acquisitions and to realize the benefits we expect when we make those acquisitions. In furtherance of this strategy, over the past several years, we have acquired businesses in Europe, Latin America, Africa and the United States.
Additionally, in April 2015, we entered into a conditional agreement to acquire TNT Express.      While we expect to successfully execute the TNT
Express acquisition, we may not be able to complete the transaction on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. Additionally, while we anticipate that our past and future acquisitions will enhance our value proposition to customers and improve
our long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all, or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired businesses, including their
goodwill or other intangible assets.        Labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential
changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so.   If we are unable to continue to maintain good relationships with our employees and prevent labor organizations from organizing groups of our employees, our operating costs could
significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced. Despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions, other than the pilots of FedEx Express and drivers at four FedEx Freight facilities, our U.S. employees
have thus far chosen not to unionize (we acquired GENCO in January 2015, which already had a small number of employees that are members of unions).      The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws, however, that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility
that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the purview of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended ( RLA ). For additional discussion of the RLA, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on  Form 10-K  under the caption  Regulation.  Such legislation could expose our customers to the type of service disruptions that the RLA was designed to prevent   local work stoppages in key areas
that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of time-sensitive,   
         - 83 -

Table of Contents  

high-value goods throughout our global network. Such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets.   
  There is also the possibility that Congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies, such as FedEx Ground and FedEx
Freight, whose employees are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended ( NLRA ). In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the National Labor Relations Board, have and may continue to take actions
that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. Finally, changes to federal or state laws governing employee classification could impact the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent contractors. If
FedEx Ground is compelled to convert its independent contractors to employees, labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlays.
       FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these
owner-operators as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged.   FedEx Ground s use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers, as evidenced by the
strong growth of this business segment. We are involved in numerous lawsuits and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that the company s owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as our employees, rather than
independent contractors. We incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent contractors.      We believe that FedEx Ground s owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an employer of the drivers of the company s independent
contractors. However, adverse determinations in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our owner-operators and their drivers to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in
employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators. Changes to state laws governing the definition of independent contractors
could also impact the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators.        We may not be able to achieve our profit improvement goal by the
end of 2016.   In 2013, we announced profit improvement programs primarily through initiatives at FedEx Express and FedEx Services that include cost reductions, modernization of our aircraft fleet, transformation of the U.S. domestic
operations and international profit improvements at FedEx Express, and improved efficiencies and lower costs of information technology at FedEx Services. To this end, since 2013, we have retired from service 25 aircraft and 42 related engines, and
we have adjusted the retirement schedule of numerous aircraft and engines, in an effort to rationalize capacity and modernize our aircraft fleet. Additionally, during 2014, we completed a voluntary buyout program offering cash buyouts to eligible
U.S.-based employees. We will continue to work towards our goal of annual profitability improvement at FedEx Express of $1.6 billion by the end of 2016. Our ability to achieve this objective is dependent on a number of factors, including the health
of the global economy and future customer demand, particularly for our priority services. In light of these factors, we may not be able to achieve our goal.        The transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities.   Because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the
world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. For example, the U.S. Transportation
Security Administration requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the
result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. Thus, it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose
material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. Moreover, a terrorist attack directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely impact demand for our services.

     The regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may impact our
operations.   Our extensive air network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the Department of Transportation and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the United States and
foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services. Our operations outside of the United States, such as FedEx Express s growing international domestic operations, are
also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete
effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. Regulatory actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights in important
international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks.        We may be affected by global climate change or by legal,
regulatory or market responses to such change.   Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ( GHG )
emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For example, in 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) issued a proposed finding on GHG emissions from aircraft and its relationships to air pollution. The
final finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions. Additionally, in 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme
( ETS ) for GHG emissions, to the airline industry. Under this decision, all FedEx Express flights that are wholly within the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission
allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights.      In addition, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered
bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on
us, especially at FedEx Express. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope and extent of
such regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could impose material costs on us.      Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm
our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air express services. Finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macro-economic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to
the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems.        A
localized disaster in a key geography could adversely impact our business.   While we operate several integrated networks with assets distributed throughout the world, there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed
to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as tornados, floods, earthquakes or terrorist attacks. The loss of a key location such as our Memphis super hub or one of our information technology centers
could cause a significant disruption to our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. Moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely impact
demand for our services.        Our business may be adversely impacted by disruptions or modifications in service by the USPS.   The
USPS is a significant customer and vendor of FedEx, and thus, disruptions or modifications in services by the USPS or any resulting structural changes to its operations, network, service offerings or pricing could have an adverse effect on our
operations and financial results.        We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including:

increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare
benefits;      
         - 85 -

the impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate
unnecessary information technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;

      MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL    
   CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended). Our internal control over financial reporting includes, among other things, defined policies and procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated information systems for processing transactions and a properly staffed,
professional internal audit department. Mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and actions are taken to correct all identified deficiencies. Our procedures for financial reporting
include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit Committee and our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals.   
  Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of
May 31, 2015, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the
COSO criteria).      Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
May 31, 2015.      The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015, has been audited by
Ernst   Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst   Young LLP s report on the
Company s internal control over financial reporting is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED    
   PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders      FedEx
Corporation      We have audited FedEx Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015, based on criteria
established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). FedEx Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.      We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
     In our opinion, FedEx Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
May 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of May 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders  investment, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2015 of FedEx Corporation and our report dated July 14, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED    
   PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders      FedEx
Corporation      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of May 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders  investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.      We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of FedEx Corporation at May 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.      As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses and the calculation of expected return on plan
assets related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2015.      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), FedEx Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated July 14, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.      /s/ Ernst   Young LLP      Memphis, Tennessee

      FEDEX CORPORATION    
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
    NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.  FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and
business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ), the
world s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight, Inc. ( FedEx Freight ), a
leading U.S. provider of less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx Services ), form the core of our reportable segments.
Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications and certain back-office support to our transportation segments. In addition, the FedEx Services segment provides customers with retail access to FedEx
Express and FedEx Ground shipping services through FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ), and provides customer service, technical support and billing and collection services through FedEx TechConnect, Inc. ( FedEx
TechConnect ).       FISCAL YEARS . Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2015
or ended May 31 of the year referenced.         RECLASSIFICATIONS . Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
years  consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation.       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION . The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FedEx and its subsidiaries, substantially all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We are not the primary
beneficiary of, nor do we have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, we have not consolidated any variable interest entity.         REVENUE RECOGNITION . We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments for our transportation businesses and upon completion of services for our business services, logistics and trade services
businesses. Transportation services are provided with the use of employees and independent contractors. FedEx is the principal to the transaction for most of these services and revenue from these transactions is recognized on a gross basis. Costs
associated with independent contractor settlements are recognized as incurred and included in the caption  Purchased transportation  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For shipments in transit, revenue is recorded based
on the percentage of service completed at the balance sheet date. Estimates for future billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable are recognized at the time of shipment for money-back service guarantees and billing corrections. Delivery
costs are accrued as incurred.      Our contract logistics, global trade services and certain transportation businesses engage in some
transactions wherein they act as agents. Revenue from these transactions is recorded on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less third-party charges, including transportation or handling costs, fees, commissions and taxes and
duties.      Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to taxes, such as sales tax, assessed by governmental authorities. We
present these revenues net of tax.       CREDIT RISK.  We routinely grant credit to many of our customers for transportation and business
services without collateral. The risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of customers, as well as the low revenue per transaction
for most of our services. Allowances for potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current economic factors on the composition of accounts receivable. Historically, credit losses have been within
management s expectations.     
         - 97 -

Table of Contents  

    ADVERTISING.  Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in other
operating expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses were $403 million in 2015, $407 million in 2014 and $424 million in 2013.     
   CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.         SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES AND
FUEL.  Spare parts (principally aircraft-related) are reported at weighted-average cost. Allowances for obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified as excess or obsolete as well as expected to be on hand at the date the
aircraft are retired from service. These allowances are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. The majority of our supplies and our fuel are reported at weighted-average cost.     
   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Expenditures for major additions, improvements and flight equipment modifications are capitalized when such costs are
determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Expenditures for equipment overhaul costs of engines or airframes prior to their operational use are capitalized as part of the cost of such assets as
they are costs required to ready the asset for its intended use. Maintenance and repairs costs are charged to expense as incurred, except for certain aircraft engine maintenance costs incurred under third-party service agreements. These agreements,
which became effective June 1, 2014, resulted in costs being expensed based on cycles or hours flown and are subject to annual escalation. These service contracts transfer risk to third party service providers and generally fix the amount we
pay for maintenance to the service provider as a rate per cycle or flight hour, in exchange for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. We capitalize certain direct internal and external costs associated with the development
of internal-use software. Gains and losses on sales of property used in operations are classified within operating expenses.      For financial
reporting purposes, we record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the asset s service life or related lease term, if shorter. For income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated
methods when applicable.      The consolidated balance sheet for 2014 reflects the reclassification of $1.1 billion of vehicles that were
previously presented in package handling and ground support equipment and $72 million of facilities and other that were previously presented in computer and electronic equipment. The reclassification has no impact on the net book value of
property and equipment, total assets, or depreciation expense.      The depreciable lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as
follows (dollars in millions):

Table of Contents  

   Substantially all property and equipment have no material residual values. The majority of aircraft
costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 15 to 30 years. We periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment. In May 2015, we adjusted the depreciable lives of
23 aircraft and 57 engines. These changes will not have a material impact on near-term depreciation expense. In May 2013, FedEx Express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 76 aircraft and related engines to aid in our fleet
modernization and improve our global network. In 2012, we shortened the depreciable lives for 54 aircraft and related engines to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft, resulting in a depreciation expense increase of $69 million in 2013. As a
result of these accelerated retirements, we incurred an additional $74 million in year-over-year accelerated depreciation expense in 2014.   
  Depreciation expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of property and equipment used in operations, was $2.6 billion in 2015 and 2014 and $2.3
billion in 2013. Depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of assets under capital lease.       CAPITALIZED INTEREST .
Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and modification of aircraft, including purchase deposits, construction of certain facilities, and development of certain software up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use is
capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the asset is actively under construction. Capitalized interest was $37 million in 2015, $29 million in 2014 and $45 million in 2013.       IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and
used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a
loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at
the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.      We operate integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for
most of our operating assets to be held and used are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level, for our analysis of impairment.      In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall
customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis. The
criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected
volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31,
2015, we had one aircraft temporarily idled. This aircraft has been idled for approximately two months and is expected to return to revenue service.      In May 2015, we retired from service seven Boeing MD11 aircraft and 12 related engines, four Airbus A310-300 aircraft and three related engines, three Airbus A300-600 aircraft and three related engines
and one Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and three related engines, and related parts. As a consequence of this decision, impairment and related charges of $276 million ($175 million, net of tax, or $0.61 per diluted share) were recorded in the fourth
quarter. Of this amount, $246 million was non-cash. The decision to permanently retire these aircraft and engines aligns with FedEx Express s plans to rationalize capacity and modernize its aircraft fleet to more effectively serve its
customers.      In 2013, we retired from service two Airbus A310-200 aircraft and four related engines, three Airbus A310-300 aircraft and two
related engines and five Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and 15 related engines. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $100 million ($63 million, net of tax, or $0.20 per diluted share) was recorded in 2013. All of these aircraft
were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.

    GOODWILL.  Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible
and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefit from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business. Goodwill is
reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the
qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment, including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value for our
reporting units is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Fair
value determinations may include both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter.       PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS.  Our defined benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management s assumptions for discount rate, investment returns on
plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover and future increases in healthcare costs. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be
effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that are designed to match our expected benefit
payments in future years. Our expected rate of return is a judgmental matter which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised as appropriate.   
  During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed our method of accounting for our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans. Under our new
method of accounting, we will immediately recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains or losses in our operating results annually in the fourth quarter each year. Further, we voluntarily changed our method for determining
the expected return on plan assets ( EROA ), which is used in the calculation of pension and other postretirement expense for funded postretirement benefit plans for interim periods. We now use the fair value of plan assets to calculate
the EROA. The new methods of accounting are collectively referred to as  mark-to-market  or MTM accounting. Historically, we recognized actuarial gains and losses, subject to a corridor, as a component of other comprehensive income and
amortized these gains and losses as a component of pension and postretirement healthcare expenses over the average future service period of the covered employees (13 years). Previously, we used a calculated value method to determine the value of
plan assets and amortized changes in the fair value of plan assets over a period no longer than four years.      We believe the immediate
recognition of actuarial gains and losses under MTM accounting is a preferable method of accounting as it aligns the recognition of changes in the fair value of plan assets and liabilities in the income statement with the fair value accounting
principles that are used to measure the net funded status of the plans in our balance sheet. MTM accounting also eliminates the impact on future periods of the amortization of the increasingly material amount of accumulated actuarial losses
resulting from persistently low interest rates and changes in demographic assumptions.      The adoption of MTM accounting is a voluntary change
in accounting principle that is required to be adopted retrospectively. Therefore all periods presented have been recast to conform to the current year presentation reflecting the retirement plan accounting changes as discussed further in Note 13
and Note 14.

   The cumulative effect of the change on retained earnings as of June 1, 2012, was a pre-tax reduction of
$8.9 billion, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and therefore no net impact to shareholders  equity. The impact of all adjustments made to the financial statements presented is summarized below (amounts in millions,
except per share data):       
     INCOME TAXES.  Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis
of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The liability method is used to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes
are paid.      We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax
position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second
step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the
probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in
facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision.
     We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense and, if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of
income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The noncurrent portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest
and penalties are recorded in the caption  Other liabilities  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Table of Contents  

    SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS.  We are self-insured for costs associated with workers  compensation
claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long-term disability programs. Accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims, which includes
incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers  compensation claims, vehicle and general liability, employee healthcare claims and long-term disability are included in accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by
operating company and type of risk. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium expense.       LEASES.  We lease certain aircraft, facilities, equipment and vehicles under capital and operating leases. The commencement date of all leases is the earlier of the date we become legally obligated
to make rent payments or the date we may exercise control over the use of the property. In addition to minimum rental payments, certain leases provide for contingent rentals based on equipment usage, principally related to aircraft leases at FedEx
Express and copier usage at FedEx Office. Rent expense associated with contingent rentals is recorded as incurred. Certain of our leases contain fluctuating or escalating payments and rent holiday periods. The related rent expense is recorded on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The cumulative excess of rent payments over rent expense is accounted for as a deferred lease asset and recorded in  Other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative
excess of rent expense over rent payments is accounted for as a deferred lease obligation. Leasehold improvements associated with assets utilized under capital or operating leases are amortized over the shorter of the asset s useful life or the
lease term.       DEFERRED GAINS.  Gains on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and other property and equipment are deferred and amortized
ratably over the life of the lease as a reduction of rent expense. Substantially all of these deferred gains are related to aircraft transactions.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  Translation gains and losses of foreign operations that use local
currencies as the functional currency are accumulated and reported, net of applicable deferred income taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within common stockholders  investment. Transaction gains and losses that
arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in the caption  Other, net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and were immaterial for each
period presented.       EMPLOYEES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ARRANGEMENTS.  The pilots of FedEx Express, which represent a small number of
FedEx Express s total employees, are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. The contract became amendable in March 2013, and the parties are currently in negotiations. In October 2014, FedEx Express formally requested assistance from
the National Mediation Board ( NMB ) to mediate the negotiations, and the NMB has been actively mediating the talks since that time. The NMB is the U.S. governmental agency that oversees labor agreements for entities covered by the
Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended. The conduct of mediated negotiations has no impact on our operations. In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, GENCO Distribution System, Inc. ( GENCO ) has a small number of employees who are
members of unions, and certain non-U.S. employees are unionized.       STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  We recognize compensation expense for
stock-based awards under the provisions of the accounting guidance related to share-based payments. This guidance requires recognition of compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method. We issue new shares or repurchase shares
on the open market to cover employee share option exercises and restricted stock grants.       TREASURY SHARES.  In September 2014, our Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million shares of common stock. It is expected that the share authorization will primarily be utilized to offset equity compensation dilution over the next several years. During 2015, we
repurchased 8.1 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $154.03 per share for a total of $1.3 billion. As of May 31, 2015, 12.2 million shares remained under the share repurchase authorization. Under this program,
shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases are made at the company s discretion, based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business, the market price of its
common stock and general market conditions. No time limit was set for the completion of the repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.         In 2014, we repurchased 36.8 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $131.83 per share for a total of $4.9 billion.       DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE.  On June 8, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 2, 2015 to
stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 18, 2015. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis at the end of each
fiscal year.       BUSINESS REALIGNMENT COSTS . During 2013, we announced profit improvement programs primarily through initiatives at FedEx
Express and FedEx Services and completed a program to offer voluntary cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. As a result of this program, approximately 3,600 employees left the company by the end of 2014. Costs of
the benefits provided under the voluntary employee severance program were recognized as special termination benefits in the period that eligible employees accepted their offers. Payments under this program were made at the time of departure and
totaled approximately $300 million in 2014 and $180 million in 2013.      The voluntary buyout program included voluntary severance payments and
funding to healthcare reimbursement accounts, with the voluntary severance calculated based on four weeks of gross base salary for every year of FedEx service up to a maximum payment of two years of pay. Of the total population leaving the company,
approximately 40% of the employees vacated positions on May 31, 2013. An additional 35% departed throughout 2014 and approximately 25% of this population remained until May 31, 2014.

Table of Contents  

   We incurred costs of $560 million ($353 million, net of tax, or $1.11 per diluted share) during 2013
associated with our business realignment activities. These costs related primarily to severance for employees who accepted voluntary buyouts in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. The cost of the buyout program is included in the caption
 Business realignment, impairment and other charges  in our consolidated statements of income. Also included in that caption are other external costs directly attributable to our business realignment activities, such as professional fees.
      USE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and
other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to
management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: self-insurance accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive accruals; tax
liabilities; loss contingencies; litigation claims; and impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill).   
    NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE    
   New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial
statements.      On June 1, 2013, we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
requiring additional information about reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income, including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income. We have adopted this guidance by including expanded accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirements in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements.   
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that will supersede virtually all existing
revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (and International Financial Reporting Standards) which has been subsequently updated to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition
standard by one year. This standard will be effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019. The fundamental principles of the new guidance are that companies should recognize revenue in a manner that reflects the timing of the transfer of services to
customers and the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that a company expects to receive for the goods and services provided. The new guidance establishes a five-step approach for the recognition of revenue. Based on our
preliminary assessment, we do not anticipate that the new guidance will fundamentally change our revenue recognition policies, practices or systems.      We believe that no other new accounting guidance was adopted or issued during 2015 that is relevant to the readers of our financial statements. However, there are numerous new proposals under development
which, if and when enacted, may have a significant impact on our financial reporting.   
    NOTE 3: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS    
   On April 6, 2015, FedEx entered into a conditional agreement to acquire TNT Express N.V. for  4.4 billion (currently,
approximately $4.9 billion). This combination is expected to expand our global portfolio, particularly in Europe, lower our cost to serve European markets by increasing density in our pickup-and-delivery operations and accelerate our global growth.
This acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2016. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary conditions, including obtaining all necessary approvals and competition clearances.

   During 2015, we acquired two businesses, expanding our portfolio in e-commerce and supply chain solutions.
On January 30, 2015, we acquired GENCO, a leading North American third-party logistics provider, for $1.4 billion, which was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our January 2015 debt issuance. The financial results of this business are
included in the FedEx Ground segment from the date of acquisition.      In addition, on December 16, 2014, FedEx acquired Bongo
International, LLC ( Bongo ), a leader in cross-border enablement technologies and solutions, for $42 million in cash from operations. The financial results of this business are included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of
acquisition.      These acquisitions will allow us to enter new markets, as well as strengthen our current service offerings to existing
customers. We expect that the goodwill of $40 million associated with our Bongo acquisition will be entirely attributable to our FedEx Express reporting unit. We expect that the goodwill of approximately $1.1 billion associated with our GENCO
acquisition will be primarily attributable to our FedEx Ground and GENCO reporting units.      The estimated fair values of the assets and
liabilities related to these acquisitions have been recorded in the FedEx Ground and FedEx Express segments and are included in the accompanying balance sheets based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price (summarized in the table below in
millions). These allocations are expected to be completed during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2016.       
    The goodwill recorded of approximately $1.1 billion is primarily attributable to expected benefits from synergies of the
combinations with existing businesses and other acquired entities and the work force in place at GENCO. The majority of the purchase price allocated to goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The intangible assets acquired consist
primarily of customer-related intangible assets, which will be amortized on an accelerated basis over an estimated life of 15 years.      In 2014,
we expanded the international service offerings of FedEx Express by completing our acquisition of the businesses operated by our previous service provider, Supaswift (Pty) Ltd., in seven countries in Southern Africa, for $36 million in cash from
operations. The financial results of these businesses are included in the FedEx Express segment from their respective date of acquisition.      In
2013, we completed our acquisitions of Rapid o Cometa Log stica e Transporte S.A., a Brazilian transportation and logistics company, for $398 million; TATEX, a French express transportation company, for $55 million; and Opek Sp. z
o.o., a Polish domestic express package delivery company, for $54 million. The financial results of these businesses are included in the FedEx Express segment from their respective date of acquisition.   
  The financial results of these acquired businesses were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our results of operations and therefore, pro
forma financial information has not been presented.

NOTE 4: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS    
    GOODWILL.  The carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment and changes therein are as follows
(in millions):          

(1)      
    Goodwill acquired relates to the acquisitions of transportation companies in Poland, France and Brazil in 2013, the acquisition of transportation
companies in Southern Africa in 2014, and the acquisition of e-commerce and supply chain solutions companies in 2015. See Note 3 for related disclosures.      

(2)      
    Primarily currency translation adjustments and acquired goodwill related to immaterial acquisitions.      
  Our reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Office (reported in the FedEx Services
segment) and GENCO (reported in the FedEx Ground segment). We evaluated reporting units for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2015. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values in 2015 and 2014, and
we do not believe that any of these reporting units were at risk as of May 31, 2015.       OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  The net book value
of our other intangible assets was $207 million at May 31, 2015 of which $164 million was related to GENCO, and $57 million at May 31, 2014. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $21 million in 2015, $23 million in 2014 and $27
million in 2013. Estimated amortization expense is expected to be $30 million in 2016 and immaterial beyond.

    Interest on our fixed-rate notes is paid semi-annually. Long-term debt, exclusive of capital leases, had estimated fair
values of $7.4 billion at May 31, 2015 and $5.0 billion at May 31, 2014. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted market prices and the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of
our long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. This classification is defined as a fair value determined using market-based inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability, either directly or
indirectly.

   We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to
sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock.      In January 2015, we issued $2.5
billion of senior unsecured debt under our current shelf registration statement, comprised of $400 million of 2.30% fixed-rate notes due in February 2020, $700 million of 3.20% fixed-rate notes due in February 2025, $500 million of 3.90% fixed-rate
notes due in February 2035, $650 million of 4.10% fixed-rate notes due in February 2045, and $250 million of 4.50% fixed-rate notes due in February 2065. We utilized $1.4 billion of the net proceeds to fund our acquisition of GENCO and the remaining
proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.      A $1 billion revolving credit facility is available to finance our operations
and other cash flow needs and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. The revolving credit agreement expires in March 2018. The agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt
(long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus six times our last four fiscal quarters  rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus total common stockholders  investment) that does not exceed 70%. Our
leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital was 61% at May 31, 2015. We believe the leverage ratio covenant is our only significant restrictive covenant in our revolving credit agreement. Our revolving credit agreement contains other customary
covenants that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially restrict the conduct of our business. We are in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant and all other covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do not expect the covenants
to affect our operations, including our liquidity or expected funding needs. As of May 31, 2015, no commercial paper was outstanding, and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit facility was available for future borrowings.   
  We issue other financial instruments in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit and surety bonds. We
had a total of $481 million in letters of credit outstanding at May 31, 2015, with $182 million unused under our primary $500 million letter of credit facility, and $867 million in outstanding surety bonds placed by third-party insurance
providers. These instruments are required under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the normal course of international operations. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our balance sheets,
where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves.   
    NOTE 7: LEASES    
   We utilize certain aircraft, land, facilities, retail locations and equipment under capital and operating leases that expire at
various dates through 2046. We leased 10% of our total aircraft fleet under operating leases as of May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014. A portion of our supplemental aircraft are leased by us under agreements that provide for cancellation upon
30 days  notice. Our leased facilities include national, regional and metropolitan sorting facilities, retail facilities and administrative buildings.      Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):

   A summary of future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with an initial or remaining
term in excess of one year at May 31, 2015 is as follows (in millions):       
    Property and equipment recorded under capital leases and future minimum lease payments under capital leases were
immaterial at May 31, 2015 and 2014. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2015 was approximately six years. While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the use of
the leased assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our lease agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.      FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay principal and interest on certain pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates are not direct
obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express.      We are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a portion of our leased
aircraft. The lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities. We are not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities, as the
lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in
increases in the value of the aircraft. As such, we are not required to consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure under these leases is included in the summary of future minimum lease payments.   
    NOTE 8: PREFERRED STOCK    
   Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, at its discretion, to issue up to 4,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. The stock is issuable in series, which may vary as to certain rights and preferences, and has no par value. As of May 31, 2015, none of these shares had been issued.

    NOTE 10: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION    
   Our total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):   
   
    We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options and restricted stock.   
   STOCK OPTIONS . Under the provisions of our incentive stock plans, key employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase
shares of our common stock at a price not less than its fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting requirements are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Option-vesting periods range from one to
four years, with 83% of our options vesting ratably over four years. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.     
   RESTRICTED STOCK . Under the terms of our incentive stock plans, restricted shares of our common stock are awarded to key employees. All
restrictions on the shares expire ratably over a four-year period. Shares are valued at the market price on the date of   
         - 110 -

award. The terms of our restricted stock provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employee s retirement. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining service or vesting period.       VALUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS . We use the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. The value of restricted stock awards is based on the stock price of the award on the grant date. We record stock-based compensation expense in the  Salaries and employee
benefits  caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.        The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation
method include the expected life of the option, stock price volatility, a risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. Following is a table of the weighted-average Black-Scholes value of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of options
exercised (in millions) and the key weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation calculations for options granted during the years ended May 31, and then a discussion of our methodology for developing each of the assumptions used in the
valuation model:       
    The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we examine
actual stock option exercises to determine the expected life of the options. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. Expected volatilities are based on the actual changes in the market value of our stock and are calculated using daily
market value changes from the date of grant over a past period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the date of grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option.
The expected dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option.      The following table summarizes
information about stock option activity for the year ended May 31, 2015:

   The options granted during the year ended May 31, 2015 are primarily related to our principal annual
stock option grant in June 2014.      The following table summarizes information about vested and unvested restricted stock for the year ended
May 31, 2015:       
    During the year ended May 31, 2014, there were 191,964 shares of restricted stock granted with a weighted-average
fair value of $100.80. During the year ended May 31, 2013, there were 220,391 shares of restricted stock granted with a weighted-average fair value of $85.45.      The following table summarizes information about stock option vesting during the years ended May 31:       
    As of May 31, 2015, there was $183 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures,
related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. This compensation expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of approximately two years.   
  Total shares outstanding or available for grant related to equity compensation at May 31, 2015 represented 9% of the total outstanding common and
equity compensation shares and equity compensation shares available for grant.

    The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 31 were as follows (in millions):
      
    The net deferred tax liabilities as of May 31 have been classified in the balance sheets as follows (in millions):

(1)      
    Noncurrent deferred tax assets are included in the line item Other Assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.      
  We have $968 million of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdictions and $589 million of state operating loss carryovers. The
valuation allowances primarily represent amounts reserved for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which expire over varying periods starting in 2016. As a result of this and other factors, we believe that a substantial portion of these
deferred tax assets may not be realized. We establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain
assumptions. We consider, among other things, our future projections of sustained profitability, deferred income tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results and potential current and future tax planning
strategies. If we were to identify and   
         - 114 -

Table of Contents  

implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the
reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance
sheets.      Permanently reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $1.9 billion at the end of 2015 and $1.6 billion at the end
of 2014. We have not recognized deferred taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes on those earnings. In 2015, our permanent reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries provided an approximate $48
million benefit to our provision for income taxes. Were the earnings to be distributed, in the form of dividends or otherwise, these earnings could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and non-U.S. withholding taxes. Unrecognized foreign
tax credits potentially could be available to reduce a portion of any U.S. tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to uncertainties related to the timing and source of
any potential distribution of such funds, along with other important factors such as the amount of associated foreign tax credits. Cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy totaled $478 million at the end of
2015 and $471 million at the end of 2014.      In 2015, approximately 75% of our total enterprise-wide income was earned in U.S. companies of
FedEx that are taxable in the United States, a reduction from 2014 due to our adoption of MTM accounting. As a U.S. airline, our FedEx Express unit is required by Federal Aviation Administration and other rules to conduct its air operations,
domestic and international, through a U.S. company. However, we serve more than 220 countries and territories around the world, and are required to establish legal entities in many of them. Most of our entities in those countries are operating
entities, engaged in picking up and delivering packages and performing other transportation services. We are continually expanding our global network to meet our customers  needs, which requires increasing investment outside the U.S. We
typically use cash generated overseas to fund these investments and have a foreign holding company which manages our investments in several foreign operating companies.      We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The IRS is currently examining our 2012 and 2013 tax returns. It is reasonably possible that certain
income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. The expected impact of any changes would not be material to our consolidated financial statements.
     A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):   
   
    Our liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions include $31 million at May 31, 2015 and $33 million at
May 31, 2014 associated with positions that if favorably resolved would provide a benefit to our effective tax rate. We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense and, if applicable, penalties are recognized as a
component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $19 million on May 31, 2015 and May 31, 2014. Total interest and penalties included in our consolidated statements of income are immaterial.   
         - 115 -

   It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may
result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals or litigation in state, local, federal and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between the U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Our liability for uncertain tax
positions includes no matters that are individually or collectively material to us. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12
months, but an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible changes cannot be made. However, we do not expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax positions will have a material effect on us.   
    NOTE 13: RETIREMENT PLANS    
   We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans,
defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future
salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages.      During the fourth quarter of 2015, we adopted mark-to-market accounting
for the recognition of our actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans as described in Note 1.      The accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the
recognition in either expense or AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation
( PBO ) of the plan.      A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years is as follows, as well as the amounts
associated with each component of the pre-tax mark-to-market loss (gain) (in millions):       
    The components of the pre-tax mark-to-market losses (gains) are as follows, in millions:
      
     2015    
  The implementation of new U.S. mortality tables in 2015 resulted in an increased participant life expectancy assumption, which increased the overall
projected benefit obligation by $1.2 billion. The weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans declined from 4.57% at May 31, 2014 to 4.38% at May 31, 2015.   
   2014       The actual rate of return on our
U.S. Pension Plan assets of 13.3% exceeded our expected return of 7.75% primarily due to a favorable investment environment for global equity markets. The weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans
decreased from 4.76% at May 31, 2013 to 4.57% at May 31, 2014.   
         - 116 -

Table of Contents  

    2013       The weighted average discount rate for all of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans increased from 4.44% at May 31, 2012 to 4.76% at May 31, 2013. The actual rate of return on our U.S.
Pension Plan assets of 12.1% exceeded our expected return of 8.0% primarily due to a favorable investment environment for global equity and credit markets.       PENSION PLANS . Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance
formula we call the Portable Pension Account. Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and
interest on the notional account balance. The Portable Pension Account benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury
index. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees. We also sponsor or
participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on
earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices.       POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS . Certain of
our subsidiaries offer medical, dental and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent,
continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988. Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at
150% of the 1993 per capita projected employer cost, which has been reached and, therefore, these benefits are not subject to additional future inflation.         PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS.  Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.        We use a measurement date of May 31 for our pension and postretirement
healthcare plans. Management reviews the assumptions used to measure pension costs on an annual basis. Economic and market conditions at the measurement date impact these assumptions from year to year. Actuarial gains or losses are generated for
changes in assumptions and to the extent that actual results differ from those assumed. These actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized and expensed in a fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustment.   
  Weighted-average actuarial assumptions for our primary U.S. retirement plans, which represent substantially all of our PBO and accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation ( APBO ), are as follows:       
 
         - 117 -

Table of Contents  

   The expected average rate of return on plan assets is the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan
assets and is a forward-looking assumption that materially affects our pension cost. Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an
annual basis and revise it as appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:       

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those
investment classes to earn over time; and          

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments
were made strictly in indexed funds.         Our consolidated expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.75% in 2015
and 2014 and 8% in 2013. Our actual return in each of the past three years exceeded those amounts for our principal U.S. domestic pension plan. However, for 2016, we have lowered our EROA assumption for long-term returns on plan assets to 6.50% as
we continue to implement our asset and liability management strategy. In lowering this assumption we considered our historical returns, our current capital markets outlook and our investment strategy for our plan assets, including the impact of the
duration of our plan liability.      Our actual return on plan assets has contracted from 2014 as we have increased our asset allocation to lower
yielding fixed income investments. For the 15-year period ended May 31, 2015, our actual annual returns were 6.70%.      The investment
strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, together with fixed-income portfolios, to earn a long-term investment return that meets our pension plan obligations. Our pension plan
assets are invested primarily in publicly tradeable securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. Our largest holding
classes are Corporate Fixed Income Securities and Government Fixed Income Securities (which are largely benchmarked against the Barclays Long Government/Long Corporate Index), and U.S. and International Large Cap Equities (which are mainly indexed
to the S P 500 Index and other global indices). Accordingly, we do not have any significant concentrations of risk. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of market indices.
As part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities. Our investment strategy also includes the limited use of
derivative financial instruments on a discretionary basis to improve investment returns and manage exposure to market risk. In all cases, our investment managers are prohibited from using derivatives for speculative purposes and are not permitted to
use derivatives to leverage a portfolio.      Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair
value:       

Cash and cash equivalents . These Level 1 investments include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. The
Level 2 investments include commingled funds valued using the net asset value.             

Domestic, international and global equities . These Level 1 investments are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the
major market on which the individual securities are traded. The Level 2 investments are commingled funds valued using the net asset value.            

Private equity . The valuation of these Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the
inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets.         
         - 118 -

Table of Contents  

Investments are valued based upon recommendations of our investment managers incorporating factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables and performance
multiples.          

Fixed income . We determine the fair value of these Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities and other fixed income
securities by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.         The fair
values of investments by level and asset category and the weighted-average asset allocations for our domestic pension plans at the measurement date are presented in the following table (in millions):

   These estimates are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary significantly
from these estimates.      Future medical benefit claims costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 7.3% during 2016, decreasing to an
annual growth rate of 4.5% in 2029 and thereafter. A 1% change in these annual trend rates would not have a significant impact on the APBO at May 31, 2015 or 2015 benefit expense because the level of these benefits is capped.   
    NOTE 14: BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION    
   FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, form the core of our
reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the following businesses:       

FedEx Express Segment   
      
    FedEx Express (express transportation)    

FedEx Trade Networks (air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage)    

FedEx SupplyChain Systems (logistics services)    

Bongo (cross-border enablement technology and solutions)    

FedEx Ground Segment   
      
    FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)    

FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator)    

GENCO (third-party logistics)    

FedEx Freight Segment   
      
    FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)    

FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation)    

FedEx Services Segment   
      
    FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office functions)    

FedEx TechConnect (customer service, technical support, billings and collections)    

FedEx Office (document and business services and package acceptance)    
     FedEx Services Segment       The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative and information technology functions in shared services operations that support our transportation businesses and allow us to
obtain synergies from the combination of these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions are performed on a regional basis by FedEx Express and reported in the FedEx Express segment in their natural expense
line items. The FedEx Services segment includes: FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications and certain back-office support to our other companies; FedEx TechConnect, which is responsible for customer
service, technical support, billings and collections for U.S. customers of our major business units; and FedEx Office, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation
businesses.      The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our transportation businesses, and we allocate all of the net
operating costs of the FedEx Services segment (including the net operating results of FedEx Office) to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation businesses in the results of those segments. Within the FedEx Services segment allocation,
the net operating results of FedEx Office, which are an immaterial component of our allocations, are allocated to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income
(inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the impact of its total allocated net operating costs on our transportation segments.   
         - 124 -

Table of Contents  

   Operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services
segment to the respective transportation segments. These allocations also include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative
revenues or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions and our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.   
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our method of accounting for our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans to immediately
recognize actuarial gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of these plans in earnings in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In addition, for purposes of calculating the EROA, we will no longer use an averaging technique for the
market-related value of plan assets but instead will use actual fair value of plan assets. This method of accounting is referred to as MTM accounting as described in Note 1. Our segment operating results follow internal management reporting, which
is used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Historically, net total benefit cost was allocated to each segment. We continue to record service cost, interest cost and EROA at the business segments. Annual recognition of
actuarial gains and losses will be reflected in our segment results only at the corporate level. Additionally, although the actual asset returns are recognized in each fiscal year through a MTM adjustment, we continue to recognize an EROA in the
determination of net pension cost. At the segment level, we have set our EROA at 6.5% for all periods presented, which will equal our consolidated EROA assumption for 2016. In fiscal years where the consolidated EROA is greater than 6.5%, that
difference is reflected as a credit in  Corporate, eliminations and other.  We have adjusted prior-period segment information to conform to the current period s presentation to ensure comparability of the segment results across all
periods, including comparisons going forward in 2016.      In addition, in 2015, we ceased allocating to our transportation segments the costs
associated with our corporate headquarters division. These costs included services related to general oversight functions, including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. This change allows for additional transparency and
improved management of our corporate oversight costs. These costs are included in  Corporate, eliminations and other  in our segment reporting and reconciliations. Prior year amounts have been revised to conform to the current year segment
presentation. This change did not impact our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Note 21.       Other Intersegment
Transactions       Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their
reportable segment. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such
intersegment revenues and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information, because the amounts are not material.

NOTE 15: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION    
   Cash paid for interest expense and income taxes for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):   

NOTE 16: GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS    
   In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the lease, sale or purchase of operating assets or services in the ordinary course
of business, we may provide routine guarantees or indemnifications (e.g., environmental, fuel, tax and software infringement), the terms of which range in duration, and often they are not limited and have no specified maximum obligation. As a
result, the overall maximum potential amount of the obligation under such guarantees and indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not been required to make significant payments under our guarantee or indemnification
obligations and no amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of these obligations.      Special
facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to finance the acquisition and construction of various airport facilities and equipment. These facilities were leased to us and are accounted for as operating leases. FedEx
Express has unconditionally guaranteed $483 million in principal of these bonds (with total future principal and interest payments of approximately $578 million as of May 31, 2015) through these leases.   
    NOTE 17: COMMITMENTS    
   Annual purchase commitments under various contracts as of May 31, 2015 were as follows (in millions):

        Primarily
equipment, advertising contracts and in 2016, approximately $500 million of estimated required quarterly contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans.         The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or services. As of May 31, 2015, our obligation to purchase three Boeing
767-300 Freighter ( B767F ) aircraft and nine Boeing 777 Freighter ( B777F ) aircraft is conditioned upon there being no event that causes FedEx Express or its employees not to be covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as
amended. Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo transport unless we have entered into noncancelable commitments to modify such aircraft. Open purchase

that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes and are not included in the table above.   
  We have several aircraft modernization programs underway that are supported by the purchase of B777F, B767F and B757 aircraft. These aircraft are
significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these
aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.      During September 2014,
FedEx Express entered into an agreement to purchase four additional B767F aircraft, the delivery of which will begin in 2017 and continue through 2019.      We had $472 million in deposits and progress payments as of May 31, 2015 on aircraft purchases and other planned aircraft-related transactions. These deposits are classified in the  Other
assets  caption of our consolidated balance sheets. Aircraft and aircraft-related contracts are subject to price escalations. The following table is a summary of the key aircraft we are committed to purchase as of May 31, 2015, with the
year of expected delivery:       
 
    NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES    
    Wage-and-Hour.  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits containing various class-action allegations of wage-and-hour
violations. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other things, that they were forced to work  off the clock,  were not paid overtime or were not provided work breaks or other benefits. The complaints generally seek unspecified
monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. We do not believe that a material loss is reasonably possible with respect to any of these matters.       Independent Contractor   Lawsuits and State Administrative Proceedings.  FedEx Ground is involved in numerous class-action lawsuits (including 25 that have been certified as class
actions), individual lawsuits and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that the company s owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors.   
  Most of the class-action lawsuits were consolidated for administration of the pre-trial proceedings by a single federal court, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Indiana. The multidistrict litigation court granted class certification in 28 cases and denied it in 14 cases. On December 13, 2010, the court entered an opinion and order addressing all outstanding motions for
summary judgment on the status of the owner-operators (i.e., independent contractor vs. employee). In sum, the court ruled on our summary judgment motions and entered judgment in favor of FedEx Ground on all claims in 20 of the 28 multidistrict
litigation cases that had been certified as class actions, finding that the owner-operators in those cases were contractors as a matter of the law of 20 states. The plaintiffs filed notices of appeal in all of these 20 cases. The Seventh Circuit
heard the appeal in the Kansas case in January 2012 and, in July 2012, issued an opinion that did not make a determination with respect to the correctness of the district court s decision and, instead, certified two questions to the Kansas
Supreme Court related to the classification of the plaintiffs as independent contractors under the Kansas Wage Payment Act. The other 19 cases that are before the Seventh Circuit were stayed pending a decision of the Kansas Supreme Court.

Table of Contents  

   On October 3, 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court determined that a 20 factor right to control test applies
to claims under the Kansas Wage Payment Act and concluded that under that test, the class members were employees, not independent contractors. The case was subsequently transferred back to the Seventh Circuit, where both parties made filings
requesting the action necessary to complete the resolution of the appeals. The parties also made recommendations to the court regarding next steps for the other 19 cases that are before the Seventh Circuit. FedEx Ground has requested that each of
those cases be separately briefed given the potential differences in the applicable state law from that in Kansas. During the second quarter of 2015, we established an accrual for the estimated probable loss in the Kansas case that was required to
be recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards. This amount was immaterial.      On July 8, 2015, the Seventh Circuit issued an order
and opinion confirming the decision of the Kansas Supreme Court, concluding that the class members are employees, not independent contractors. Additionally, the Seventh Circuit referred the other 19 cases to a representative of the court for
purposes of setting a case management conference to address briefing and argument for those cases.      The multidistrict litigation court
remanded the other eight certified class actions back to the district courts where they were originally filed because its summary judgment ruling did not completely dispose of all of the claims in those lawsuits. Three of these matters settled for
immaterial amounts and have received court approval. One of the cases is currently pending in the Eastern District of Arkansas. Another case was appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals where the court reversed the class-wide summary
judgment decision on May 28, 2015 and remanded the case for trial, holding that there are disputed issues of fact as to whether the class members are employees or independent contractors. Two cases in Oregon and one in California were appealed
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the court reversed the district court decisions and held that the plaintiffs in California and Oregon were employees as a matter of law and remanded the cases to their respective district courts for
further proceedings. In the first quarter of 2015, we recognized an accrual for the then-estimated probable loss in those cases that was required to be recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards. This amount was immaterial.   
  In June 2015, the parties in the California case engaged in mediation and reached an agreement to settle the matter for $228 million, and we have
increased the accrual to that amount. The settlement agreement has been filed with the court for approval.      In the Oregon cases, material
exposure above the accrued amount is reasonably possible. We continue to evaluate what facts may arise in the course of discovery and what legal rulings the courts may render and how these facts and rulings might impact FedEx Ground s loss. For
a number of reasons, we are not currently able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued. The number and identities of plaintiffs in these lawsuits are uncertain, as they are dependent on how the class of
full-time drivers is defined and how many individuals will qualify based on whatever criteria may be established. In addition, the parties have conducted only very limited discovery into damages, which could vary considerably from plaintiff to
plaintiff and be dependent on evidence pertaining to individual plaintiffs, which has yet to be produced in the cases. Further, the range of potential loss could be impacted substantially by future rulings by the court, including on the merits of
the claims, on FedEx Ground s defenses, and on evidentiary issues.      With respect to the matters that are pending outside of Oregon, it is
reasonably possible that potential loss in some of these lawsuits or changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators could be material. Similar to our analysis of loss contingency in the Oregon cases, we continue
to evaluate what facts may arise in the course of discovery and what legal rulings the courts may render and how these facts and rulings might impact FedEx Ground s loss. As a consequence of many of the same factors described above, as well as
others that are specific to these cases, we are not currently able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. We do not believe that a material loss is probable in these matters.      In addition, we are defending contractor-model cases that are not or are no longer part of the multidistrict litigation. These cases are in varying stages of litigation, and we do not expect to incur a
material loss in any of these matters.      Adverse determinations in matters related to FedEx Ground s independent contractors, could, among
other things, entitle certain of our owner-operators and their drivers to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground, and could
result in changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators in certain jurisdictions. We believe that FedEx Ground s owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is
not an employer of the drivers of the company s independent contractors.

    City and State of New York Cigarette Suit.  On December 30, 2013, the City of New York filed
suit against FedEx Express and FedEx Ground arising from our alleged shipments of cigarettes to New York City residents. The claims against FedEx Express were subsequently dismissed. On March 30, 2014, the complaint was amended adding the State
of New York as a plaintiff. Beyond the addition of the State as a plaintiff, the amended complaint contains several amplifications of the previous claims. First, the claims now relate to four shippers, none of which continues to ship in our network.
Second, the amended complaint contains a count for violation of the Assurance of Compliance ( AOC ) we had previously entered into with the State of New York, claiming that since 2006, FedEx has made shipments of cigarettes to residences
in New York in violation of the AOC. Lastly, the amendment contains new theories of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) violations. In May 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss almost all of the claims. On
November 12, 2014, the City and State of New York filed a separate but almost identical lawsuit that includes two additional shippers. This complaint was amended in May 2015 to include additional shippers. On March 9, the court ruled on
our motion to dismiss in the first case, granting our motions to limit the applicable statute of limitations to four years and to dismiss a portion of the claims. The court, however, denied our motion to dismiss some of the claims, including the
RICO claims. Loss in these lawsuits is reasonably possible, but the amount of any loss is expected to be immaterial.       Environmental
Matters.  SEC regulations require disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that management reasonably believes could
exceed $100,000.      In February 2014, FedEx Ground received oral communications from District Attorneys  Offices (representing
California s county environmental authorities) and the California Attorney General s Office (representing the California Division of Toxic Substances Control ( DTSC )) that they were seeking civil penalties for alleged violations
of the state s hazardous waste regulations. Specifically, the California environmental authorities alleged that FedEx Ground improperly generates and/or handles, stores and transports hazardous waste from its stations to its hubs in California.
In April 2014, FedEx Ground filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California against the Director of the California Division of Toxic Substances Control and the county District Attorneys
with whom we have been negotiating. In June 2014, the California Attorney General filed a complaint against FedEx Ground in Sacramento County Superior Court alleging violations of FedEx Ground as described above. The County District Attorneys filed
a similar complaint in Sacramento County Superior Court in July 2014. The county and state authorities filed a motion to dismiss FedEx Ground s declaratory judgment action, and their motion was granted on January 22, 2015. FedEx Ground
filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 23, 2015. Loss is probable as to the enforcement action commenced by the county authorities, and we have established an accrual for the estimated probable loss. This
amount was immaterial. Loss is reasonably possible as to the action commenced by the DTSC; however, the amount of any loss is expected to be immaterial.      On January 14, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) issued a Grand Jury Subpoena to FedEx Express relating to an asbestos matter previously investigated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. On May 1, 2014, the DOJ informed us that it had determined to continue to pursue the matter as a criminal case, citing seven asbestos-related regulatory violations associated with removal of roof materials from a hangar in
Puerto Rico during cleaning and repair activity, as well as violation of waste disposal requirements. Loss is reasonably possible; however, the amount of any loss is expected to be immaterial.   
   Department of Justice Indictment   Internet Pharmacy Shipments.  In the past, we received requests for information from the DOJ in the
Northern District of California in connection with a criminal investigation relating to the transportation of packages for online pharmacies that may have shipped pharmaceuticals in violation of federal law. In July 2014, the DOJ filed a criminal
indictment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in connection with the matter. A superseding indictment was filed in August 2014. The indictment alleges that FedEx Corporation, FedEx Express and FedEx Services,
together with certain pharmacies, conspired to unlawfully distribute controlled substances, unlawfully distributed controlled substances and conspired to unlawfully distribute misbranded drugs. The superseding indictment adds conspiracy to launder
money counts related to services provided to and payments from online pharmacies. We continue to believe that our employees have acted in good faith at all times and that we have not engaged in any illegal activities.   
         - 131 -

   Accordingly, we will vigorously defend ourselves in this matter. If we are convicted, remedies could include
fines, penalties, forfeiture and compliance conditions. Given the early stage of this proceeding, we cannot estimate the amount or range of loss, if any; however, it is reasonably possible that it could be material if we are convicted.   
   Other Matters.  In August 2010, a third-party consultant who works with shipping customers to negotiate lower rates filed a lawsuit in federal
district court in California against FedEx and United Parcel Service, Inc. ( UPS ) alleging violations of U.S. antitrust law. This matter was dismissed in May 2011, but the court granted the plaintiff permission to file an amended
complaint, which FedEx received in June 2011. In November 2011, the court granted our motion to dismiss this complaint, but again allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff filed a new complaint in December
2011. On April 30, 2015, the court dismissed the case, finding that the plaintiff failed to provide certain evidence necessary to allow the case to proceed. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on May 26, 2015.   
  In February 2011, shortly after the initial lawsuit was filed, we received a demand for the production of information and documents in connection with a
civil investigation by the DOJ into the policies and practices of FedEx and UPS for dealing with third-party consultants who work with shipping customers to negotiate lower rates. In November 2012, the DOJ served a civil investigative demand on the
third-party consultant seeking all pleadings, depositions and documents produced in the lawsuit. We are cooperating with the investigation, do not believe that we have engaged in any anti-competitive activities and will vigorously defend ourselves
in any action that may result from the investigation. While the litigation proceedings and the DOJ investigation move forward, and the amount of loss, if any, is dependent on a number of factors that are not yet fully developed or resolved, the
amount of any loss is expected to be immaterial.      On June 30, 2014, we received a Statement of Objections from the French Competition
Authority ( FCA ) addressed to FedEx Express France, formerly known as TATEX, regarding an investigation by the FCA into anticompetitive behavior that is alleged to have occurred primarily in the framework of trade association meetings
that included the former general managers of TATEX prior to our acquisition of that company in July 2012. In September 2014, FedEx Express France submitted its observations in response to the Statement of Objections to the FCA. In April 2015, the
FCA issued a report responding to the observations submitted by all companies involved in the investigation. We submitted an answer to the FCA s report in early July. Loss in this matter is probable, and we established an accrual for the
estimated probable loss. This amount was immaterial.      FedEx and its subsidiaries are subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of their business. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to these other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   
    NOTE 19: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
   Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Frederick W. Smith, currently holds an approximate 10% ownership interest in the
National Football League Washington Redskins professional football team and is a member of its board of directors. FedEx has a multi-year naming rights agreement with Washington Football, Inc. granting us certain marketing rights, including the
right to name the stadium where the team plays and other events are held  FedExField.

NOTE 20: SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS (UNAUDITED)    

(1)   
        The fourth quarter
of 2015 includes a $2.2 billion retirement plans mark-to-market loss, $276 million of impairment and related charges resulting from the decision to permanently retire and adjust the retirement schedule of certain aircraft and related engines at
FedEx Express and a $197 million reserve increase due to the settlement of a legal matter at FedEx Ground. In addition, the first, second and third quarters of 2015 and all quarters of 2014 have been recast to conform to the current year
presentation reflecting the retirement plans accounting changes discussed further in Note 1 and Note 13 and that were included in our June 12, 2015,  Form 8-K  filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.          

(2)   
        The sum of the
quarterly earnings per share may not equal annual amounts due to differences in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.      
    NOTE 21: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   We are required to present condensed consolidating financial information in order for the subsidiary guarantors of our public debt to
continue to be exempt from reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. FedEx Express, however, currently files reports under such act.      The guarantor subsidiaries, which are wholly owned by FedEx, guarantee $7.0 billion of our debt. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Our guarantor subsidiaries were not
determined using geographic, service line or other similar criteria, and as a result, the  Guarantor Subsidiaries  and  Non-guarantor Subsidiaries  columns each include portions of our domestic and international operations.
Accordingly, this basis of presentation is not intended to present our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for any purpose other than to comply with the specific requirements for subsidiary guarantor reporting.

        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        INTEREST RATES.  While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates,
we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt because the interest rates are fixed on all of our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had outstanding
fixed-rate, long-term debt (exclusive of capital leases) with estimated fair values of $7.4 billion at May 31, 2015 and $5.0 billion at May 31, 2014. Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair
value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to $208 million as of May 31, 2015 and $165 million as of May 31, 2014. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market
prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.        We have interest rate risk with respect to our
pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized. Declines in the value of plan
assets could diminish the funded status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plans. Substantial investment losses on plan assets would also increase pension expense.   
   FOREIGN CURRENCY.  While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce and business services, the substantial majority of our transactions
are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the Chinese yuan, euro, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. Historically, our exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenues than our expenses, as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as aircraft and fuel expenses. During 2015, foreign currency fluctuations had a
moderately positive impact on operating income. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations was slightly negative in 2014. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand
for our services, which is not quantifiable. At May 31, 2015, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in an increase in operating
income of $36 million for 2016. This theoretical calculation required under SEC guidelines assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar, which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign
currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors  services become more or less attractive.
The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.         COMMODITY.  While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk is largely mitigated by our indexed fuel surcharges. For additional discussion of our indexed fuel
surcharges, see the  Fuel  section of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.          OTHER.  We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

     Fiscal 2016 Annual Incentive Compensation Program    
   Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer       Mr. Smith s fiscal 2016 annual incentive compensation ( AIC ) payout opportunity will be based on the achievement of corporate objectives for company financial performance for the
fiscal year, subject to adjustment by the independent members of the Board of Directors as described below.      The independent
members of the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, may adjust Mr. Smith s bonus amount upward or downward based on their annual evaluation of Mr. Smith s performance, including the quality
and effectiveness of his leadership, the execution of key strategic initiatives and the following corporate performance measures:       

FedEx s stock price performance relative to the Standard   Poor s 500 Composite Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and competitors;      

FedEx s stock price to earnings (P/E) ratio relative to the Standard   Poor s 500 Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
and competitors;          

FedEx s market capitalization;          

FedEx s revenue and operating income growth (excluding certain unusual items and the year-end mark-to-market accounting adjustment for defined
benefit pension and other postretirement plans (the  MTM Adjustment )) relative to competitors;          

FedEx s free cash flow (excluding business acquisitions), return on invested capital (excluding certain unusual items and the MTM Adjustment), and
weighted average cost of capital;          

Analyst coverage and ratings for FedEx s stock;          

FedEx s U.S. and international revenue market share;      

FedEx s reputation rankings by various publications and surveys; and      

Each FedEx business segment s achievement of corporate objectives for financial performance under the fiscal 2016 AIC program.
        None of these factors will be given any particular weight in determining whether to adjust Mr. Smith s bonus
amount.      Mr. Smith s fiscal 2016 AIC payout will be based on the following company financial performance measures
(subject to adjustment as described above):       

FedEx Express Segment Operating Income : Mr. Smith s fiscal 2016 AIC payout is conditioned upon the achievement of the FedEx Express
segment operating income threshold objective for Mr. Smith under the fiscal 2016 AIC program.          

Consolidated Operating Income : If the FedEx Express segment operating income threshold objective for Mr. Smith under the fiscal 2016 AIC
program is achieved, Mr. Smith s AIC payout opportunity will be tied to the achievement of corporate objectives for consolidated operating income (excluding the MTM Adjustment), subject to the maximum payout opportunity. The consolidated
operating income target objective under the fiscal 2016 AIC program is the same as the fiscal 2016 business plan objective for consolidated operating income (excluding, in each case, the MTM Adjustment). Subject to achievement of the FedEx Express
segment operating income threshold objective for Mr. Smith and any adjustment by the independent directors as described above, Mr. Smith s minimum fiscal 2016 AIC payout will be 50% of his target payout.      
         2   

Mr. Smith s AIC bonus target for fiscal 2016 is 130% of his base salary actually
paid during fiscal 2016, with a maximum payout of 200% of his target bonus.       Other Named Executive Officers    
  Mr. Bronczek s fiscal 2016 AIC target payout opportunity will be based on the achievement of corporate objectives for FedEx
Express segment operating income for fiscal 2016. The FedEx Express segment operating income target objective under the fiscal 2016 AIC program is the same as the fiscal 2016 business plan objective for FedEx Express segment operating income.
Above-target payouts for Mr. Bronczek will be tied to the achievement of corporate objectives for consolidated operating income (excluding the MTM Adjustment), subject to the maximum payout opportunity. Mr. Bronczek s fiscal 2016 AIC
payout opportunity is not subject to a floor.      The fiscal 2016 AIC payout opportunity for each of Messrs. Graf, Glenn and
Carter will be based on the achievement of corporate objectives for consolidated operating income (excluding the MTM Adjustment), subject to a minimum payout of 50% of his target payout (as it may be adjusted as described below) and the maximum
payout opportunity.      Mr. Smith may adjust each officer s bonus amount based on the achievement of individual
performance objectives established at the beginning of the fiscal year. Mr. Smith will determine the achievement level of each officer s individual objectives at the conclusion of fiscal 2016.   
  Mr. Bronczek s AIC bonus target for fiscal 2016 is 100% of his base salary actually paid during fiscal 2016, with a maximum
payout of 200% of his target bonus. The fiscal 2016 AIC bonus target for each of Messrs. Graf, Glenn and Carter is 90% of their respective base salary actually paid during fiscal 2016, with a maximum payout of 200% of the target bonus.   
   Long-Term Incentive Program        LTI Payout Opportunities       FedEx s long-term incentive
( LTI ) plans for the three-fiscal-year periods 2014 through 2016, 2015 through 2017 and 2016 through 2018 provide long-term cash bonus opportunities to members of upper management, including the named executive officers, upon the
conclusion of fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, if certain aggregate fully diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) goals established by the Board of Directors are achieved with respect to those periods. No amounts can be earned for the
fiscal 2014 through 2016, 2015 through 2017 and 2016 through 2018 plans until 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, because achievement of the EPS goals can only be determined following the conclusion of the applicable three-fiscal-year period.
  
         3   

The following table sets forth the potential future payouts to each of FedEx s named
executive officers under FedEx s LTI plans:       
    The potential individual future payouts set forth in the table above are set dollar amounts ranging from
threshold (minimum) amounts, if the EPS goal achieved is less than target, up to maximum amounts, if the plan goal is substantially exceeded. There can be no assurance that the potential future payouts shown in this table will be achieved.
      Stock Repurchase Program-Related Adjustments to EPS for LTI Plan Purposes    
  During fiscal 2014 and the first quarter of fiscal 2015, FedEx repurchased 42.2 million shares as part of its stock repurchase
program. Because the positive impact on EPS resulting from this stock repurchase program did not reflect core business performance, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the exclusion of the impact
of the stock repurchase program (net of interest expense on debt issued to fund a portion of the program) on fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 EPS for purposes of the FY2014-FY2016 LTI plan. As a result, (i) adjusted fiscal 2014 EPS of $6.68, rather
than fiscal 2014 EPS of $6.75 (as originally reported before FedEx s adoption of mark-to-market ( MTM ) accounting for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans), and (ii) adjusted fiscal 2015 EPS of $8.24,
rather than adjusted fiscal 2015 EPS of $8.87 (as discussed in more detail below), are being used for purposes of the FY2014-FY2016 LTI plan. Fiscal 2016 EPS will be adjusted following the end of that fiscal year using a similar methodology to
exclude the impact of the stock repurchase program for purposes of the FY2014-FY2016 LTI plan.   
         4   

Typically, the base-year number over which the three-year average annual EPS growth rate
goals are measured for an LTI plan is the final full-year EPS of the preceding fiscal year. For the FY2015-FY2017 LTI plan, however, the base-year year number is $7.12, not fiscal 2014 EPS of $6.75 (as originally reported before FedEx s
adoption of MTM accounting for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans). The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved this increase in the base-year EPS in order to exclude the impact of
FedEx s stock repurchase program on a prospective basis, thereby making subsequent adjustments of EPS with respect to the stock repurchase program in future years unnecessary for purposes of the FY2015-FY2017 LTI plan.   
   Mark-to-Market Accounting and Other Adjustments to EPS for LTI Plan Purposes    
  The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the exclusion of certain items from fiscal 2015
EPS for purposes of FedEx s FY2014-FY2016 and FY2015-FY2017 LTI plans and for establishing the base-year EPS for the FY2016-FY2018 LTI plan. For purposes of these plans, fiscal 2015 EPS was adjusted to exclude: (i) the net impact of
FedEx s adoption of MTM accounting for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, including the impact of lowering the expected return on plan assets assumption from 7.75% to 6.5% in the presentation of segment results for all
prior periods; (ii) aircraft impairment and related charges recorded in the fourth quarter; and (iii) a charge in the fourth quarter to increase the legal reserve associated with the settlement of a legal matter at FedEx Ground to the
amount of the settlement.      As a result, adjusted fiscal 2015 EPS of $8.87, rather than reported fiscal 2015 EPS of $3.65, is
being used for purposes of the FY2014-FY2016 LTI plan (before the adjustment relating to the stock repurchase program described above) and the FY2015-FY2017 LTI plan. The Board of Directors determined that, by excluding these items, payouts, if any,
under these plans will more accurately reflect FedEx s core financial performance in fiscal 2015. In addition, $8.87 will be the base-year EPS for the FY2016-FY2018 LTI plan.   
  Because the MTM Adjustment is not reflective of core business performance, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the
Compensation Committee, also determined that the MTM Adjustment will be excluded from fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 EPS for purposes of the FY2014-FY2016 and FY2015-2017 LTI plans and from EPS calculations under future LTI plans, beginning with the
FY2016-FY2018 LTI plan.

EXHIBIT 18  
 July 14, 2015    The Board of Directors and Stockholders
   FedEx Corporation    942 South Shady Grove Road  
 Memphis, TN 38120    Ladies and Gentlemen:  
 Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of FedEx Corporation included in its Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2015 describes
changes in the methods of accounting for actuarial gains and losses and the calculation of expected return on plan assets for all of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The change in method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses
is from a method that recognizes such gains and losses in Stockholders  Investment in the period incurred and amortizes them as a component of net periodic benefit expense in future periods subject to a corridor, to a method that recognizes
actuarial gains and losses in the income statement in the period incurred. The change in method of computing expected returns on plan assets is from a method that utilizes a calculated value of plan assets to a method that utilizes the actual fair
value of plan assets. There are no authoritative criteria for determining a  preferable  method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses or of calculating expected returns on plan assets based on the particular circumstances; however,
we conclude that such changes in methods of accounting are to acceptable alternative methods which, based on your business judgment to make this change and for the stated reasons, are preferable in your circumstances.  

Very truly yours,
