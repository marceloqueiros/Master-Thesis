      PART I    
     ITEM 1. BUSINESS        Overview       FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of
transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in four business segments:   

FedEx Express  : Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ) is the world s largest express transportation company,
offering time-certain delivery to more than 220 countries and territories, connecting markets that comprise more than 90% of the world s gross domestic product. The FedEx Express segment also includes FedEx Trade Networks, Inc., which provides
international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding, and FedEx SupplyChain Systems, Inc., which offers a range of supply chain solutions.      

FedEx Ground  : FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ) is a leading North American provider of small-package ground
delivery services. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to every business address in the United States and Canada, as well as residential delivery to nearly 100% of U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. The FedEx
Ground segment also includes FedEx SmartPost, Inc., which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages using the U.S. Postal Service ( USPS ) for final
delivery to any residential address or PO Box in the United States.          

FedEx Freight  : FedEx Freight, Inc. ( FedEx Freight ) is a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload
( LTL ) freight services across all lengths of haul, offering: FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet supply chain needs; and FedEx Freight Economy, when time can be traded for cost savings. The FedEx Freight segment also
offers freight delivery service to most points in Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and includes FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., a leading North American provider of time-specific, critical shipment services.

FedEx Services  : FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx Services ) provides our other companies with sales, marketing,
information technology, communications and back-office support. The FedEx Services segment also includes FedEx TechConnect, Inc., which is responsible for customer service, billings and collections for our U.S. customers and offers technical support
services, and FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ), which provides document and business services and retail access to our package transportation businesses.      
  For financial information concerning our reportable business segments, refer to the accompanying financial section, which includes management s
discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and our consolidated financial statements.      Our Web site is located
at  fedex.com . Detailed information about our services, e-commerce tools and solutions, and citizenship efforts can be found on our Web site. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports
on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our Web site, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. These and other SEC filings are available through the Investor
Relations page of our Web site,  http://investors.fedex.com . The information on our Web site, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year indicates our fiscal year ended May 31 of the
year referenced.       Strategy    
  FedEx was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio
of companies. We intend to continue leveraging and extending the FedEx brand and providing our customers with convenient, seamless access to our entire portfolio of integrated services.      We believe that sales and marketing activities, as well as the information systems that support the extensive automation of our delivery services, are functions that are best coordinated across operating
companies. Through the use of advanced information systems that connect the FedEx companies, we make it convenient for customers to use the full range of FedEx services. We believe that seamless information integration is critical to obtain business
synergies from multiple operating units. For example, our Web site,   fedex.com , provides a single point of contact for our customers to access FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipping, pick-up, shipment tracking, customer
service and invoicing information, as well as FedEx Office services. Similarly, by making one call to FedEx Expedited Freight Services, our customers can quickly and easily evaluate surface and air freight shipping options available from FedEx
Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in order to select the service best meeting their needs. Through this one point of contact, customers can select from a broad range of freight services, based on their pickup and delivery
requirements, time sensitivity and the characteristics of the products being shipped. Also, we have integrated our LTL and parcel sales teams to enhance the effectiveness of our sales efforts and provide additional simplicity for our customers.
     We manage our business as a portfolio   in the long-term best interest of the enterprise, not a particular operating company. As a
result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements on achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For
each FedEx company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. As an example of our commitment to managing collaboratively, all our management
incentive compensation programs across the enterprise are tied to the performance of FedEx as a whole.      While we have increased our emphasis
on competing collectively and managing collaboratively, we continue to believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, results in optimal service quality, reliability and profitability from each business
unit. Each FedEx company focuses exclusively on the market sectors in which it has the most expertise and can be independently enhanced and managed to provide outstanding service to our customers. Each company s operations, cost structure and
culture are designed to serve the unique customer demands of a particular market segment and as a result, we are able to adapt our networks in response to changing needs.      Our  compete collectively, operate independently, manage collaboratively  strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our various operating companies to align with varying macro-economic
conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility and uncertainty have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to
accommodate changing conditions in the global economy. For example, in response to sluggish economic growth, we recently retired from service 10 aircraft and related engines and shortened the depreciable lives of an additional 76 aircraft and
related engines. In addition, we have decreased capacity between Asia and the United States.   
         4

   At the same time, we continue to expand network capacity at our growing and highly successful FedEx Ground
segment. Strategic management of the FedEx Ground business resulted in higher yields and volumes boosted by e-commerce and market share gains from continued growth in our FedEx Home Delivery service in 2013.   
  The following four trends have driven world commerce and shaped the global marketplace, and we believe they will continue to do so over the long term:

Globalization:   As the world s economy has become more fully integrated, companies are sourcing and selling globally. With customers
in more than 220 countries and territories, we facilitate this supply chain through our global reach, delivery services and information capabilities.          

Supply Chain Acceleration:   While the growth of global trade has slowed, companies of all sizes continue to depend on the delivery of
just-in-time inventory to help them compete. We have taken advantage of the move toward more efficient supply chains by helping customers obtain more visibility into their supply chains and near real-time information to manage inventory in motion,
thereby reducing overhead and obsolescence and speeding time-to-market.          

Increase in High-Tech and High-Value-Added Businesses:   High-tech and high-value-added goods have increased as a percentage of total
economic output, and our various operating companies offer a unique menu of services to fit virtually all shipping needs of high-tech and high-value-added industries.      

Growth of E-Commerce:   E-commerce acts as a catalyst for the other three trends and is a vital growth engine for businesses, as the
Internet is increasingly being used to purchase goods and services. Through our global transportation and technology networks, we contribute to and benefit from the growth of e-commerce.      
  These trends have produced an unprecedented expansion of customer access   to goods, services and information. Through our global transportation,
information technology and retail networks, we help to make this access possible. We continue to position our companies to facilitate and capitalize on this access and move toward stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability. To this
end, we are investing in long-term strategic projects focused on expanding and modernizing our global networks to accommodate future volume growth and increase customer convenience, such as investments in B777F and B767F aircraft. We also continue
to broaden and more effectively bundle our portfolio of services in response to the needs and desires of our customers. For example, since the beginning of 2013, we:       

Continued to reduce transit times and provide a better pickup experience within FedEx Ground s growing and highly profitable network.

Made strategic acquisitions in Poland, France and Brazil, and entered into agreements to acquire the businesses operated by our current service
provider in five countries in Southern Africa, which are giving and will give us more robust transportation networks in these countries and added capabilities in these important international markets.      
         5

Continued to execute our aggressive plan to expand the global freight forwarding presence of FedEx Trade Networks   by opening additional
facilities (over 140 freight forwarding offices are now open), including in Glasgow, Scotland, Bangkok, Thailand, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Guadalajara and Monterrey, Mexico, and Dublin, Ireland, and establishing new alliances throughout the world.

Introduced enhancements to the FedEx Deep Frozen Shipping Solution that offer more options and broader access to the end-to-end service that helps
customers move temperature-sensitive samples and specimens around the world using an innovative liquid nitrogen dry vapor technology that maintains a temperature below -150 degrees Celsius for up to 10 days.      

Expanded the availability of our sensor-based SenseAware service, which provides customers with near real-time tracking of a package s vital
statistics within the in-transit supply chain or stationary inventory monitoring, to international markets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore, all the while adding new capabilities to provide customers with greater flexibility
and reach.          

Continued to utilize FedEx Freight s expertise in technology and operational excellence under the unified LTL network to provide a powerful value
proposition to customers.          Business Realignment       During 2013, we saw a more challenging business environment   particularly for FedEx Express, as ongoing shifts from priority to deferred shipping services significantly impacted profitability. In
response to these trends, in addition to the continued profit improvements in the base businesses at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, our profit improvement programs announced in 2013 are targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion at
FedEx Express by the end of 2016 (from the full year 2013 base business). The plan identifies several things the company will do, including reducing our costs, modernizing our aircraft fleet as discussed above, adjusting our transportation networks
to meet changing customer needs and remaining dedicated to our people and culture, which have made us what we are today. In the face of tepid global economic growth, shifting customer preferences and volatile fuel prices, we continue to adapt our
networks, striking the right balance between volume and yield improvements.      More specifically, multiple initiatives primarily across FedEx
Express and FedEx Services are reducing our overall cost structure. For example, we completed a voluntary program offering cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions, and approximately 3,600 employees either have left
or will be leaving voluntarily by the end of 2014. We are also streamlining support functions and eliminating redundant systems and processes. At the same time, in addition to modernizing our air fleet, we are transforming our U.S. domestic express
network by closing and realigning regional and district facilities, reorganizing pickup and delivery operations while maintaining our outstanding service levels, improving flight and crew scheduling, refining aircraft maintenance processes and
improving fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet. Internationally, we are working to improve the quality of our international revenue as customers continue to make more economical choices in a low-growth global economy by moving the line-haul of
certain slower-moving shipments to third-party transportation providers and better leveraging capacity within the FedEx Express international network through, for example, the reduction of flights to and from Asia. The international acquisitions
discussed above will also help drive significant increases in international domestic revenues. Lastly, we are improving revenue quality by adding value for our customers with innovative and market-leading solutions, expanding our small and
medium-size customer base and adding services for vertical industries such as healthcare and aerospace. Our way forward is clear, as we continue to make FedEx an even leaner, more efficient business.

    Reputation and Responsibility    
  By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the world s most recognized
brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2013, FedEx ranked 10   th    in  FORTUNE  magazine s  World s Most Admired
Companies  list   the 12   th    consecutive year we
have been ranked in the top 20 on the list. Additionally, FedEx recently ranked 12   th    on the Reputation Institute s  U.S Reputation Pulse  list, which measures the corporate reputations of the largest U.S. companies based on consumers  trust, esteem, admiration and
good feeling about a company. Lastly, in a 2012 survey of U.S. consumers conducted by the Reputation Institute and the Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship, FedEx placed 7   th    on the Corporate Social Responsibility Index (CSRI) 50   a list of the most socially responsible companies in the
United States.      FedEx is well recognized as a leader, not only in the transportation industry and technological innovation, but also in global
citizenship. We understand that a sustainable global business is tied to our global citizenship, and we are committed to connecting the world responsibly and resourcefully. Our latest published update to our global citizenship report is available at
 http://csr.fedex.com . These reports describe how we think about our responsibilities in the area of global citizenship and include important goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling these responsibilities.   
    Our People     
  Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. In
2012, FedEx Express was named as one of the top five global companies to work for by The Great Place to Work     
Institute in its inaugural ranking of the World s Best Multinational Workplaces. FedEx Express made this ranking s top 10 list again in 2013. In order to even be considered for this honor, a company must appear on at least five national
Great Place to Work lists and have at least 5,000 employees worldwide. Additionally, in 2013, we were listed among  Black Enterprise  magazine s  40 Best Companies for Diversity,  a list that we have made for eight consecutive
years. Most recently, FedEx was named among FORTUNE magazine s 2013  100 Best Companies to Work For  in the United States, a list we have made 11 of the past 14 years. It is our people   our greatest asset   that give us our
strong reputation. In addition to superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network, with more than 300,000 team members who are  absolutely, positively  focused on safety, the highest ethical and
professional standards, and the needs of their customers and communities. Through our internal Purple Promise and Humanitarian Award programs, we recognize and reward employees who enhance customer service and promote human welfare. For additional
information on our people-first philosophy and workplace initiatives, see  http://csr.fedex.com .        Our Community
       FedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people,
resources and network. We provide financial contributions, in-kind charitable shipping services and volunteer efforts by our team members to help a variety of non-profit organizations achieve their goals and make a measurable impact on the world. We
have three core focus areas: disaster preparedness, relief and recovery (American Red Cross, The Salvation Army, Direct Relief and Heart to Heart International); pedestrian and road safety (Safe Kids Worldwide and United Nations Decade of Action for
Road Safety); and environmental sustainability (Arbour Day Foundation, EMBARQ, National Fish   Wildlife Foundation and The Nature Conservancy). We support minority access to higher education by funding scholarships, are a major sponsor of
the National Civil Rights Museum and also support Teach for America, Junior Achievement and ORBIS International. Additionally, FedEx supports   
         7   

Table of Contents  

communities throughout the United States with an annual United Way employee giving campaign. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, FedEx stepped in and assisted in delivering almost
4 million pounds of relief aid on behalf of agencies such as the American Red Cross, Heart to Heart International, Direct Relief and The Salvation Army. For additional information on our community involvement and disaster relief efforts, see
 http://csr.fedex.com .        The Environment        In furtherance of our commitment to protecting the environment, we recently updated one of our long-term goals to increase FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency to reflect the significant progress we have
made over the last several years   we have already reached more than 22 percent cumulative improvement in fuel economy since 2005. Our goal is to now increase FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency by 30 percent by 2020. We continue with our
goal to reduce aircraft emissions by 30 percent by 2020 on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis, a goal that we increased from 20 percent in 2012. We have also established a goal of obtaining 30 percent of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by
the year 2030.      We will continue to expand on-site renewable energy generation where feasible. To meet our future
operational needs, as discussed above, we are adding more fuel-efficient aircraft to our fleet. The use of newer and more fuel-efficient aircraft is reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise and increasing our jet fuel efficiency. Our
electric delivery fleet has grown to 360 low-emission hybrid-electric vehicles and 165 zero-emission electric vehicles. Additionally, we recently purchased 1,900 lightweight, composite-body Reach vehicles from Utilimaster to join our 400 Reach
vehicles already in service, making our FedEx Express lightweight, composite-body vehicle fleet the largest in the industry. The Reach van is 35% more fuel efficient than traditional vehicles in the FedEx Express fleet. Our solar power generation
systems represent another step we are taking toward progressive environmental stewardship and resource sustainability. We operate nine solar facilities around the world, including the newest roof top solar-electric system at FedEx Express s
distribution hub in Newark, New Jersey, with 8,684 solar modules covering 3.5 acres across three buildings on the roof of the Newark hub. In addition, nine FedEx facilities in the United States, including our FedEx Express facility in Las Vegas,
Nevada, our FedEx Express World Headquarters in Memphis and our enterprise data center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, have received certification by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED     ), the U.S. Green Building Council s system for rating the environmental performance of buildings.
FedEx Express has made LEED certification the standard for newly built U.S. facilities.      We also continue to evaluate the environmental
impacts of our packaging and copy and print services, and minimize waste generation through efforts that include recycling, pollution prevention and the use of copy paper with recycled content, among other environmentally-responsible available
choices. For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see  http://csr.fedex.com . In April 2012, we launched our FedEx Carbon-Neutral Envelope shipping program to all FedEx envelope shipping options,
making FedEx Express the first global express transportation company to offer carbon-neutral envelope shipping at no extra charge to the customer. Through this program, FedEx Express makes an investment in global projects that displace or sequester
greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere, neutralizing the impacts of the carbon emissions emitted during the shipment of all FedEx envelopes around the world.

     Governance        FedEx has an independent Board of Directors committed to the highest quality corporate governance. During the past two years, we have added highly qualified, independent directors to the Board in R. Brad
Martin, the former CEO of Saks Incorporated, and Joshua Cooper Ramo, Vice Chairman of Kissinger Associates, Inc. The Board has taken significant steps to enhance its accountability to stockholders in recent years. For example, in September 2011,
stockholders approved our proposal to amend FedEx s certificate of incorporation in order to allow holders of 20 percent or more of FedEx s common stock the right to call special meetings of stockholders. Additionally, in June 2012, the
Board adopted a lead independent director corporate governance structure.      Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our
governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest
standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the corporate governance section
of the Investor Relations page of our Web site at  http://investors.fedex.com . We will post in the Corporate Governance section of the Investor Relations page of our Web site information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the
provisions of the Code to the extent such disclosure is required.       Business Segments    
  The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments:       FedEx Express Segment         FedEx Express

provide time-definite delivery within five business days worldwide. FedEx International First, which provides a time-definite, customs cleared, door-to-door express service with a pre-defined
delivery commitment of as early as 8:00 a.m. in the United States, 9:00 a.m. in Europe, and 10:00 a.m. in Asia, Canada and Latin America, was expanded in 2013 and now covers 19 destination countries. FedEx Express also offers domestic
pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, China, India, Mexico, Brazil, France and Poland. In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight
services, backed by a money-back guarantee, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance.      In April 2013, we launched FedEx Delivery
Manager, which allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. By signing up at  www.fedex.com , customers can receive
notification of FedEx Express packages en route to their homes, and can choose various delivery options.      For information regarding FedEx
Express e-shipping tools and solutions, see  FedEx Services   Technology.        International Expansion    
  We are focused on the long-term expansion of our international presence, especially in key markets such as China, India, Europe and Latin America. We
recently made strategic moves in Europe and Latin America. In 2013, we acquired:       

the Polish domestic express package delivery company Opek Sp. z o.o.;      

the French express transportation company TATEX; and      

the Brazilian transportation and logistics company Rapid o Cometa Log stica e Transporte S.A.      
  These acquisitions, along with our 2012 acquisition of the Mexican domestic express package delivery company Servicios Nacionales Mupa, S.A. de C.V.
(Multipack), give us more robust transportation networks within these countries and added capabilities in these important international markets, continue our strategic European and Latin American growth plans and are expected to provide important
contributions to our long-term growth, productivity and profitability. Additionally, in 2013, we opened 48 new stations across Europe pursuant to our organic growth strategy. In June 2013, we signed agreements to acquire the businesses operated by
our current service provider Supaswift (Pty) Ltd. in five countries in Southern Africa, including South Africa.      We began serving mainland
China in 1984, have expanded our service to cover more than 400 cities across the country and, in 2009, we began operations at our new Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China. Our new North Pacific regional
hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which will serve as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the United States, and will continue to operate as an international gateway for customers in western Japan, is
scheduled to open in the spring of 2014. Additionally, in October 2012, we announced plans to establish a new International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai. This new facility, with designated onsite customs clearance, will be located at
Shanghai s Pudong International Airport and is slated for completion in early 2017. These hubs will allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets.

   To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade
consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.       U.S. Postal Service Agreement       Under an agreement with the USPS that runs through
September 2013, FedEx Express provides domestic air transportation services to the USPS, including for its First-Class, Priority and Express Mail. In April 2013, FedEx Express entered into a new seven-year transportation agreement with the USPS for
the provision of domestic air transportation services to the USPS for Priority and Express Mail. The new agreement begins on October 1, 2013 and runs through September 2020. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the
USPS s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed (GXG) under a separate agreement.       Pricing    
  FedEx Express periodically publishes list prices in its Service Guides for the majority of its services. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the
service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. International rates are based on the type of service provided and vary with size, weight, destination
and, whenever applicable, whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. FedEx Express offers its customers discounts generally based on actual or potential average daily revenue produced.   
  FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally
and contractually possible. The surcharge percentage is subject to monthly adjustment based on a rounded average of a certain spot price for jet fuel. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2013 was based on the average spot price for jet fuel
published for April 2013. Changes to the FedEx Express fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the average spot price for jet fuel and FedEx Express trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points
may change from time to time, but information on the fuel surcharge for each month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable. The weighted average U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound fuel surcharge as a
percentage of the base rates for the past three years was: 2013   12%; 2012   14%; and 2011   10%. These percentages include certain fuel surcharge reductions that are associated with our annual base rate increases.   
   Operations       FedEx Express s
primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company s multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional
hubs in Newark, Oakland, Fort Worth and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago.      Facilities in
Anchorage, Paris, Guangzhou and Cologne/Bonn serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita
Airport in Tokyo, Stansted Airport outside London, and Pearson Airport in Toronto. The facilities in Guangzhou, Paris and Cologne/Bonn are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami   the
Miami Gateway Hub   serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets.      Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express
operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station s service area. In some international areas, independent agents (Global Service Participants)
have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption  FedEx Express Segment.

   FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its U.S. and Canadian retail
locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites. Our unmanned FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, and corporate or
industrial parks.       Fuel Supplies and Costs       During 2013, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these
contracts is purchased at market prices. Because of our indexed fuel surcharge, we do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See  FedEx Express   Pricing.       The following table sets forth FedEx Express s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:   
   
    Most of FedEx Express s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.   
   Competition       As described in
Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ), the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. The
ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability and innovative service offerings.   
  Competitors within the United States include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. ( UPS ), passenger
airlines offering express package services, regional express delivery concerns, air freight forwarders and the USPS. FedEx Express s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, TNT, other foreign postal authorities, freight forwarders,
passenger airlines and all-cargo airlines. Many of FedEx Express s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable
operating conditions than FedEx Express.       Employees       David J. Bronczek is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2013, FedEx Express employed approximately 112,000
permanent full-time and 48,700 permanent part-time employees, of which approximately 14% are employed in the Memphis area. FedEx Express s international employees in the aggregate represent approximately 37% of all employees.   
         12

   The pilots of FedEx Express, who constitute a small percentage of our total employees, are represented by
the Air Line Pilots Association, International ( ALPA ), and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. This agreement became amendable in March 2013, and the parties are currently in negotiations.   
  Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not
resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees. Certain of FedEx
Express s non-U.S. employees are unionized. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent.        FedEx Trade Networks
       FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight
forwarding. Since the beginning of 2013, FedEx Trade Networks continued to execute an aggressive plan to expand its global freight forwarding presence   by opening additional facilities (over 140 freight forwarding offices are now open),
including in Glasgow, Scotland, Bangkok, Thailand, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Guadalajara and Monterrey, Mexico, and Dublin, Ireland, and establishing new alliances throughout the world. FedEx Trade Networks provides customs clearance services for
FedEx Express at its major U.S. hub facilities. Value-added services include Global Trade Data, an information tool that allows customers to track and manage imports. FedEx Trade Networks provides international trade advisory services, including
assistance with the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program, and through its WorldTariff subsidiary, FedEx Trade Networks publishes customs duty and tax information for approximately 180 customs areas worldwide. In 2013, FedEx
Trade Networks completed its mission to enable ACE (Automated Commercial Environment) entry summary filing at all U.S. ports of entry   ACE is U.S. Customs and Border Protection s new automation system, and by getting on board early, FedEx
Trade Networks has developed its expertise and improved its system capabilities for the new regulatory environment. FedEx Trade Networks has approximately 4,570 employees and 146 offices in 123 service locations throughout North America and in Asia,
Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. FedEx Trade Networks maintains a network of air and ocean freight-forwarding service providers and has entered into strategic alliances to provide services in certain countries in which it does not
have owned offices.        FedEx SupplyChain Systems        FedEx SupplyChain is an integrated logistics provider offering a range of supply chain solutions that leverage FedEx information technology and transportation networks around the world. The company offers
services that include critical inventory logistics, transportation management and temperature-controlled transportation through a network of owned and managed resources   all tightly integrated via advanced information technology systems. FedEx

    FedEx Ground Segment         FedEx Ground         Overview    
  By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx
Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on
business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is
also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers.   
  FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network, by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and
introducing or expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. For example, during the most recent two-year period, FedEx Ground has reduced the transit times of 4.4% of its lanes. FedEx Ground s ongoing network expansion program
is substantially increasing the company s daily pickup capacity through the addition of new hubs featuring the latest automated sorting technology, the expansion of existing hubs, and the expansion or relocation of other existing facilities.
     The company offers our FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches nearly 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting
the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and
their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee.      In April 2013, we
launched FedEx Delivery Manager, which allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. By signing up at
 www.fedex.com , customers can receive notification of FedEx Ground packages en route to their homes, and can choose various delivery options.       Pricing       FedEx Ground periodically publishes list prices for the majority of its services
in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, destination zone, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account.   
  FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is subject to a monthly adjustment. The surcharge percentage is based on a rounded average of the
national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published monthly by the U.S. Department of Energy. For example, the fuel surcharge for June 2013 was based on the average diesel fuel price published for April 2013. Changes to
the FedEx Ground fuel surcharge, when calculated according to the rounded index average and FedEx Ground trigger points, are applied effective from the first Monday of the month. These trigger points may change from time to time, but information on
the fuel surcharge for each month is available at  fedex.com  approximately two weeks before the surcharge is applicable.

    Operations       FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system consisting of 528 facilities, including 33 hubs, in the United States and Canada. FedEx Ground conducts its operations
primarily with approximately 35,640 owner-operated vehicles and approximately 38,100 company-owned trailers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service, FedEx Ground leverages its existing pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. FedEx Home
Delivery s operations are often co-located with existing FedEx Ground facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies.      Advanced
automated sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination
chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination terminals for local delivery. Software systems and Internet-based applications are also deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external
delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx Web site,  fedex.com . For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-shipping tools and solutions, see
 FedEx Services   Technology.       FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its U.S. and
Canadian retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at many FedEx Authorized ShipCenters in the United States.      As
of May 31, 2013, FedEx Ground had approximately 53,300 employees. In addition, FedEx Ground relies on independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of independent contractors is well suited
to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers. Henry J. Maier is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its primary competitors are UPS and the USPS.
      Independent Contractor Model    
  Although FedEx Ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (such as state tax or other administrative challenges) where the
classification of its independent contractors is at issue, a number of recent judicial decisions support the company s classification, and the company believes its relationship with its contractors is generally excellent. For a description of
these proceedings, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ) and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.      FedEx Ground has made changes to its relationships with the small businesses it contracts with that, among other things, provide incentives for improved service and enhanced regulatory and other
compliance by the contractors. For example, FedEx Ground has implemented or is implementing its Independent Service Provider ( ISP ) model in a number of states. The ISP model requires pickup-and-delivery contractors based in those states
to, among other things: (i) assume responsibility for the pickup-and-delivery operations of an entire geographic service area that includes multiple routes, and (ii) negotiate independent agreements with FedEx Ground, rather than agree to
a standard contract. To date, FedEx Ground has transitioned to the ISP model in 17 states. Depending on a number of considerations, FedEx Ground may transition to it in other states as well.      In addition, because of state-specific legal and regulatory issues, FedEx Ground only contracts with businesses that (i) are organized as corporations registered and in good standing under applicable
state law, and (ii) ensure that their personnel who provide services under an operating agreement with FedEx Ground are treated as their employees. FedEx Ground also has an ongoing nationwide program to incentivize owners who choose to grow
their businesses by adding routes. During May 2013, approximately 87% of FedEx Ground s package volume was delivered by business owners operating multiple routes.

to their files across our online and retail channels. Lastly, we now offer our FedEx SameDay City service in select U.S. ZIP codes, which allows customers to get their packages across town in the same day with local delivery by FedEx Office
uniformed employees.      As of May 31, 2013, FedEx Office operated approximately 1,800 locations, including 30 locations in four foreign
countries, as well as 20 closed production centers. FedEx Office is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.       Trademarks    
  The  FedEx  trademark, service mark and trade name is essential to our worldwide business. FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight,
FedEx Office, FedEx Services, FedEx SupplyChain Systems, FedEx TechConnect, FedEx Trade Networks, FedEx SmartPost and FedEx Custom Critical, among others, are trademarks, service marks and trade names of Federal Express Corporation, or the
respective companies, for which registrations, or applications for registration, are on file, as applicable. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names by our contractors
and Global Service Participants to support our business. In addition, we license the use of certain of our trademarks, service marks and trade names on promotional items for the primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.   
   Regulation        Air . Under the
Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, both the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) and the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.   
  The FAA s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well
as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the
federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.   
  In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest
time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including FedEx Express, were exempt from these new pilot fatigue
requirements, and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of us from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that future security or
flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us.      The DOT s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air
transportation. The DOT s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing
FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.   
         20

   Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security
Administration ( TSA ), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA continues to require FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan,
which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for
our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.      FedEx
Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ( CRAF ) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need,
including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its
participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. Government for such charter flights.
      Ground . The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the
Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety
and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.      The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx
Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of
rates and service in intrastate freight transportation.      Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx
Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.       International . FedEx Express s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates
international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of United States air carriers abroad. The right of a United States carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT s
approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the United States and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The
regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to
current and potential additional aviation security regulation by foreign governments.      Our operations outside of the United States, such as
FedEx Express s growing international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult and sometimes prohibit, the ability
of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.  
         21   

Table of Contents  

    Communication . Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its
aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express s activities
pertaining to satellite communications.       Environmental . Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation
of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express s aircraft operations in some of
the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect on any of FedEx Express s significant markets. Congress s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx
Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.   
  Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to
limit greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For example, during 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) for GHG
emissions, to the airline industry. Under this decision, all FedEx Express flights to and from any airport in any member state of the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission allowances
in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. Because the European Union ETS is being contested by many countries on a number of fronts, and the effective date for parts of the ETS has been delayed until next year, the future
impact on us is unclear. For a description of such efforts and their potential effect on our cost structure and operating results, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ).   
  We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods,
contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, the disposal of waste oil and the disposal of toners and other products used in FedEx Office s copy machines. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground
fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs to ensure compliance with these regulations.
      Customs.  Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and
Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are
subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.       Labor.  All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are
covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the  RLA ), while labor relations within the United States at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the  NLRA ). Under the
RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board before a union can strike or an employer
can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led
mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.   
         22   

Table of Contents  

   The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation
systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since
the founding of the company in 1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays.
Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.      The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that
Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. In
addition, federal and state governmental agencies have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these potential labor law changes, see Item 1A of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Risk Factors ).       Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human
Rights Act.  We have comprehensive export controls and economic sanctions programs designed to ensure compliance with United States and other applicable export laws, rules and regulations. As part of our ongoing efforts to monitor the
effectiveness of our international trade compliance programs, we recently identified the shipments described below involving FedEx Express, which occurred during 2013.      During 2013, a Dubai-based package consolidator tendered approximately 32,000 shipments to FedEx Express for handling, including 16 separate shipments for delivery to branches of Mir Business Bank in
Russia and branches of Bank Melli in Azerbaijan, Iraq and Germany. Both banks are identified on the list of Specially Designated Nationals maintained by the United States Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control
( OFAC ). Each of these shipments contained only documents. The aggregate revenue for these shipments was $212. There was no profit associated with these shipments.      This consolidator also tendered six separate shipments to FedEx Express for delivery to Iranian embassies and a consulate in Germany, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand and Argentina. These shipments contained
documents, books, magazines, CDs, toys, nuts and/or candy. The aggregate revenue for these shipments was $218. There was no profit associated with these shipments.      The tendering of these shipments to FedEx Express violated the terms of the written agreements between FedEx Express and this consolidator.      FedEx Express s handling of these shipments was inadvertent and not in accordance with our internal policies and procedures. Promptly upon learning of these shipments, FedEx Express canceled its
agreements with the consolidator described above and certain other Dubai-based package consolidators and discontinued certain services in Dubai. We have implemented enhanced controls, procedures and other measures in connection with our
international trade compliance programs that are designed to prevent these activities from recurring.      Our investigation into past shipments
tendered by Dubai-based consolidators is ongoing. We have made initial voluntary disclosures to OFAC and will supplement these disclosures as our investigation is completed. We intend to fully cooperate with OFAC regarding these matters.   
     ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       We present information about our risk factors on pages 76 through 81 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.         ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS       None.   
     ITEM 2. PROPERTIES        FedEx Express Segment       FedEx Express s principal owned and leased properties include
its aircraft, vehicles, national, regional and metropolitan sorting facilities, administration buildings, FedEx Drop Boxes and data processing and telecommunications equipment.

Table of Contents  

    Aircraft and Vehicles       As of May 31, 2013, FedEx Express s aircraft fleet consisted of the following:       

(1)      
    Maximum gross structural payload includes revenue payload and container weight.      

(2)      
    Includes 16 aircraft not currently in operation and awaiting completion of modification.      

The B777Fs are two-engine, wide-bodied cargo aircraft that have a longer range and larger capacity than any other aircraft we operate.

The MD11s are three-engine, wide-bodied aircraft that have a longer range and larger capacity than MD10s.      

The MD10s are three-engine, wide-bodied aircraft that have received an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) modification, which includes a conversion to a
two-pilot cockpit, as well as upgrades of electrical and other systems.          

The B757s are two-engine, narrow-bodied aircraft configured for cargo service.      

The ATR and Cessna 208 turbo-prop aircraft are leased to independent operators to support FedEx Express operations in areas where demand does not
justify use of a larger aircraft.         An inventory of spare engines and parts is maintained for each aircraft type.   
  In addition, FedEx Express leases smaller aircraft to operators, and these operators use the aircraft to move FedEx packages to and from airports served
by FedEx Express s larger jet aircraft. The lease agreements generally call for the lessee to provide the flight crews, maintenance, fuel and other supplies required to operate the aircraft, and FedEx Express reimburses the lessee for these
items. The lease agreements are for terms not exceeding one year and are generally cancelable upon 30 days  notice.      At May 31,
2013, FedEx Express operated approximately 54,100 ground transport vehicles, including pickup and delivery vans, larger trucks called container transport vehicles and over-the-road tractors and trailers.

   FedEx Express s primary sorting facility, which serves as the center of its multiple hub-and-spoke
system, is located at the Memphis International Airport. FedEx Express s facilities at the Memphis International Airport also include aircraft hangars, aircraft ramp areas, vehicle parking areas, flight training and fuel facilities,
administrative offices and warehouse space. FedEx Express leases these facilities from the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority (the  Authority ). The lease obligates FedEx Express to maintain and insure the leased property and to pay
all related taxes, assessments and other charges. The lease is subordinate to, and FedEx Express s rights thereunder could be affected by, any future lease or agreement between the Authority and the U.S. Government.

        MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND        FINANCIAL CONDITION          OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL SECTION       The financial section of the
FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report ) consists of the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ( MD A ), the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Other Financial Information, all of which include information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our
financial results. The following MD A describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity, capital resources, contractual cash obligations and the critical accounting estimates of FedEx. The discussion in the financial
section should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, particularly  Item 1: Business  and our detailed discussion of risk factors included in this MD A.   
    ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION        Our
MD A is composed of three major sections: Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the following information:   

Results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2013 results compared to 2012, and 2012 results compared to 2011. This section also
includes a discussion of key actions and events that impacted our results, as well as our outlook for 2014.          

The overview is followed by a financial summary and analysis (including a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for 2014) for
each of our reportable transportation segments.          

Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations, including
a discussion of our cash flows and our financial commitments.          

Critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are important to understanding certain of the material
judgments and assumptions incorporated in our financial results.          

We conclude with a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may impact our financial and operating results.      
    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS        We
provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies are Federal
Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ), the world s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and
FedEx Freight, Inc. ( FedEx Freight ), a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc.
( FedEx Services ), form the core of our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office support to our transportation segments. In addition, the FedEx
Services segment provides customers with retail access to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping services through FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ) and provides customer service, technical support and billing and
collection services through FedEx TechConnect, Inc. ( FedEx TechConnect ). See  Reportable Segments  for further discussion and refer to  Item 1: Business  for a more detailed description of each of our operating
companies.   
         -39-

Table of Contents  

   The key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:   

the overall customer demand for our various services based on macro-economic factors and the global economy;      

the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight;

the mix of services purchased by our customers;          

the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per hundredweight for LTL freight
shipments);          

our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to match shifting volume levels; and

the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges.
        The majority of our operating expenses are directly impacted by revenue and volume levels. Accordingly, we expect these
operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent with the change in revenues and volumes. Therefore, the discussion of operating expense captions focuses on the key drivers and trends impacting expenses other than changes in
revenues and volume.      Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 or ended May 31
of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. References to our transportation segments include, collectively, our FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments.

      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
    CONSOLIDATED RESULTS        The
following table compares summary operating results (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31:       

(1)      
    Operating expenses include $560 million for business realignment costs and a $100 million impairment charge resulting from the decision to retire ten
aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express.          

(2)      
    Operating expenses include an impairment charge of $134 million resulting from the decision to retire 24 aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express
and the reversal of a $66 million legal reserve which was initially recorded in 2011 at FedEx Express.          

(3)      
    Operating expenses include $133 million in costs associated with the combination of our FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations, effective
January 30, 2011, and a $66 million legal reserve at FedEx Express.         The following table shows changes in revenues and
operating income by reportable segment for 2013 compared to 2012, and 2012 compared to 2011 (dollars in millions):       

(1)      
    FedEx Express segment 2013 operating expenses include $405 million of direct and allocated business realignment costs and an impairment charge of $100
million resulting from the decision to retire 10 aircraft and related engines. Additionally, FedEx Express segment 2012 operating expenses include an impairment charge of $134 million resulting from the decision to retire 24 aircraft and related
engines and the reversal of a $66 million legal reserve that was initially recorded in 2011.          

(2)      
    FedEx Ground segment 2013 operating expenses include $105 million of allocated business realignment costs.      

(3)      
    FedEx Freight segment 2013 operating expenses include $50 million of direct and allocated business realignment costs. Additionally, FedEx Freight
segment 2011 operating expenses include $133 million in costs associated with the combination of our FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations, effective January 30, 2011.

Table of Contents  

     Overview        Our results for 2013 reflect a significant impact of certain charges (described below), which negatively impacted our earnings by $1.31 per diluted share. Beyond these factors, our results for 2013
benefited from the strong performance of FedEx Ground, which continued to grow market share, and ongoing profit improvement at FedEx Freight. However, a decline in profitability was experienced at our FedEx Express segment resulting from ongoing
shifts in demand from our priority international services to economy international services which could not be fully offset by network cost and capacity reductions in 2013.      Our 2013 results include business realignment costs of $560 million, primarily related to our voluntary cash buyout program (see  Business Realignment, Impairment and Other Charges  for
additional information). Furthermore, in May 2013, we made the decision to retire from service 10 aircraft and related engines, which resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of $100 million.  
  In addition, actions in 2012 at FedEx Express related to fleet modernization resulted in the accelerated retirement of certain aircraft which negatively
impacted our 2013 results by $69 million due to additional depreciation recorded for the shortened lives of the aircraft.      Our 2012 revenues,
operating income and operating margins reflected the exceptional performance of our FedEx Ground segment, improved profitability at FedEx Freight and increased yields across all our operating segments. Our results significantly benefited in 2012
from the timing lag that exists between when fuel prices change and when indexed fuel surcharges automatically adjust. Our 2012 results included the reversal of a $66 million legal reserve initially recorded in 2011 and an aircraft impairment charge
of $134 million at FedEx Express.

   The following graphs for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight show selected yield trends for the
years ended May 31:         

Revenue        Revenues increased 4% in 2013 primarily driven by increases in international domestic revenue at FedEx Express and volume growth at FedEx Ground. At FedEx Ground, revenues increased 10% in 2013 primarily
due to volume growth from market share gains. At FedEx Express, revenues increased 2% due to increases in international domestic revenues from recent acquisitions and growth in our freight-forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks. Base revenue
growth at FedEx Express in 2013 was constrained by global economic conditions as shifts in demand from our priority international services to our economy international services and lower rates resulted in declines in international export package
yields. At FedEx Freight, revenues increased 2% as a result of higher yield and average daily LTL shipments.      During 2012, revenues increased
9% due to yield growth across all our transportation segments. At FedEx Express, revenues increased 8% in 2012 led by higher U.S. domestic and international export package yields. However, U.S. domestic package and international export package
volumes declined due to weakening global economic conditions. Revenues increased 13% during 2012 at our FedEx Ground segment due to higher yields and strong demand for all our major services. At FedEx Freight, revenues increased 8% during 2012 due
to higher LTL yield as a result of higher fuel surcharges and yield management programs, despite a decrease in volume.

     Operating Income        The following tables compare operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts (in millions) and as a percent of revenue for the years ended May 31:   

(1)      
    Includes predominantly severance costs associated with our voluntary buyout program and charges resulting from the decision to retire 10 aircraft and
related engines at FedEx Express.          

(2)      
    Represents charges resulting from the decision to retire 24 aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express.      

(3)      
    Represents charges associated with the combination of our FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations effective January 30, 2011.

Our 2013 operating income and operating margin decreased primarily due to the impact of business realignment costs, aircraft impairment charges and
accelerated aircraft depreciation (see  Overview  section above). Beyond these factors, operating income was positively impacted in 2013 by higher volumes and increased yields at our FedEx Ground segment and by increased yields and higher
volumes at our FedEx Freight segment. However, the ongoing shifts in demand from priority international services to economy international services and lower rates resulted in a substantial decline in profitability at FedEx Express.   
  Purchased transportation increased 15% in 2013 due to volume growth at FedEx Ground, recent international business acquisitions and the expansion of our
freight forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks. Salaries and benefits increased 3% in 2013 primarily due to increases in pension and group health insurance costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. Other expenses
increased 5% in 2013 primarily due to the impact of business acquisitions and the reversal in 2012 of a legal reserve.

   The following graph for our transportation segments shows our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per
gallon for the years ended May 31:         

Fuel expense decreased 4% during 2013 primarily due to lower jet fuel prices and lower aircraft fuel usage. Our fuel
surcharges, which are more fully described in the  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  section of this MD A, have a timing lag and are designed to pass through the price of fuel not included in our base shipping
rates to our customers. Based on a static analysis of the impact to operating income of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel had a negative impact on operating income in 2013.   
  Our analysis considers the estimated impact of the reduction in fuel surcharges included in the base rates charged for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground
services. However, this analysis does not consider the negative effects that fuel surcharge levels may have on our business, including reduced demand and shifts by our customers to lower-yielding services. While fluctuations in fuel surcharge rates
can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price and
extra service charges we obtain for these services and the level of pricing discounts offered. In order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and yield growth, we have included the comparative fuel
surcharge rates in effect for 2013, 2012 and 2011 in the accompanying discussions of each of our transportation segments.      In 2012, operating
income increased 34% and operating margin increased 140 basis points driven by higher yields across all our transportation segments due to higher fuel surcharges and our yield management programs. Our results also significantly benefited in 2012
from the timing lag that exists between when fuel prices change and when indexed fuel surcharges automatically adjust. FedEx Ground segment operating income increased $439 million in 2012 driven by higher yields and strong demand for all our major
services. At our FedEx Freight segment, operating income increased $337 million due to higher LTL yield and efficiencies gained from the combination of our LTL operations in 2011.      Salaries and benefits increased 5% in 2012 primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and the full reinstatement of 401(k) company-matching contributions effective January 1, 2011.
Purchased transportation costs increased 12% in 2012 due to volume growth and higher fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground, costs associated with the expansion of our freight forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks and higher utilization of
third-party transportation providers in international locations primarily due to business acquisitions at FedEx Express.      Fuel expense
increased 19% during 2012 primarily due to price increases. Based on a static analysis of the impact to operating income of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel surcharges significantly
exceeded incremental fuel costs in 2012.

     Other Income and Expense        Interest expense increased $30 million in 2013 primarily due to a reduction in capitalized interest and increased interest expense from 2013 debt issuances. Other expense increased in 2013 driven by
foreign currency translation due to global currency volatility. Interest expense decreased $34 million in 2012 due to debt maturities, an increase in capitalized interest related to the timing of progress payments on aircraft purchases and lower
financing fees.       Income Taxes        Our effective tax rate was 36.4% in 2013, 35.3% in 2012 and 35.9% in 2011. Our 2012 rate was favorably impacted by the conclusion of the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) audit of our 2007-2009
consolidated income tax returns. Our permanent reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries provided a 1.2% benefit to our 2013 effective tax rate. Our total permanently reinvested foreign earnings were $1.3
billion at the end of 2013 and $1.0 billion at the end of 2012.      Our current federal income tax expenses in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were
significantly reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions we claimed under provisions of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 and the Tax Relief and the Small Business Jobs Acts of 2010. Those Acts, designed to stimulate new business
investment in the U.S., accelerated our depreciation deductions for qualifying investments, such as our Boeing 777 Freighter ( B777F ) aircraft. These were timing benefits only, in that depreciation accelerated into an earlier year is
foregone in later years. Our 2013 current provision for federal income taxes was, therefore, higher than in 2012 and 2011.      The components of
the provision for federal income taxes for the years ended May 31 were as follows (in millions):       
    For 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 36.5% and 37.0%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a
number of factors, including the amount and source of operating income. We also expect our current federal income tax expense will increase in 2014 due to lower accelerated depreciation benefits than in prior years.   
  Additional information on income taxes, including our effective tax rate reconciliation, liabilities for uncertain tax positions and our global tax
profile can be found in Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

     Business Acquisitions        During 2013, we expanded the international service offerings of FedEx Express by completing the following business acquisitions:   

Rapid o Cometa Log stica e Transporte S.A., a Brazilian transportation and logistics company, for $398 million in cash from operations on
July 4, 2012          

TATEX, a French express transportation company, for $55 million in cash from operations on July 3, 2012      

Opek Sp. z o.o., a Polish domestic express package delivery company, for $54 million in cash from operations on June 13, 2012
        These acquisitions give us more robust transportation networks within these countries and added capabilities in these
important international markets. See Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions.   
  In 2012, we completed our acquisition of Servicios Nacionales Mupa, S.A. de C.V. (MultiPack), a Mexican domestic express package delivery company, for
$128 million in cash from operations on July 25, 2011. In 2011, we completed the acquisition of the Indian logistics, distribution and express businesses of AFL Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliate Unifreight India Pvt. Ltd. for $96 million in cash
from operations on February 22, 2011.      The financial results of these acquired businesses are included in the FedEx Express segment from
the date of acquisition and were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our results of operations and therefore, pro forma financial information has not been presented. Substantially all of the purchase price in each of these
acquisitions was allocated to goodwill, which was entirely attributed to our FedEx Express reporting unit.      On June 20, 2013, we signed
agreements to acquire the businesses operated by our current service provider Supaswift (Pty) Ltd. in five countries in Southern Africa. The acquisition will be funded with cash from operations and is expected to be completed in the second half of
2014, subject to customary closing conditions. The financial results of the acquired businesses will be included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of acquisition and will be immaterial to our 2014 results.   
    Business Realignment, Impairment and Other Charges        During 2013, we announced profit improvement programs primarily through initiatives at FedEx Express and FedEx Services that include the following:   

Cost reductions in selling, general and administrative functions through headcount reductions, streamlining of processes and elimination of less
essential work, as well as deriving greater value from strategic sourcing          

Modernization of our aircraft fleet, transformation of the U.S. domestic operations and international profit improvements at FedEx Express

Improved efficiencies and lower costs of information technology at FedEx Services      
  During 2013, we conducted a program to offer voluntary cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. The voluntary buyout
program includes voluntary severance payments and funding to healthcare reimbursement accounts, with the voluntary severance calculated based on four weeks of gross base salary for every year of FedEx service up to a maximum payment of two years of
pay. This program was completed in the fourth quarter and approximately 3,600 employees have left or will be voluntarily leaving the company by the end of 2014. Eligible employees are scheduled to vacate positions in phases to ensure a smooth
transition in the impacted functions so that we maintain service levels to our customers. Of the total population leaving the   
         -48-

Table of Contents  

company, approximately 40% of the employees vacated positions on May 31, 2013. An additional 35% will depart throughout 2014 and approximately 25% of this population will remain until
May 31, 2014. Costs of the benefits provided under the voluntary program were recognized as special termination benefits in the period that eligible employees accepted their offers.      We incurred costs of $560 million ($353 million, net of tax, or $1.11 per diluted share) during 2013 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs related primarily to severance for
employees who accepted voluntary buyouts in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. Payments will be made at the time of departure. Approximately $180 million was paid under this program during 2013. The cost of the buyout program is included in the
caption  Business realignment, impairment and other charges  in our consolidated statements of income. Also included in that caption are other external costs directly attributable to our business realignment activities, such as
professional fees.      In addition, actions in 2012 at FedEx Express related to fleet modernization resulted in accelerated depreciation of $69
million in 2013 included in the caption  Depreciation and amortization  in our consolidated statements of income as we shortened the lives of certain aircraft.      In May 2013, we made the decision to retire from service two Airbus A310-200 aircraft and four related engines, three Airbus A310-300 aircraft and two related engines, and five Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and
15 related engines. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $100 million ($63 million, net of tax, or $0.20 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. The decision to retire these aircraft, which were
temporarily idled and not in revenue service, aligns with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet and improve its global network.      In May 2012, we retired from service 24 aircraft and related engines, the majority of which were temporarily idled and not in revenue service. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment
charge of $134 million ($84 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.      See the
 Long-lived Assets  section of our  Critical Accounting Estimates  for a discussion of our accounting for aircraft retirement decisions.        Outlook        We anticipate revenue and earnings growth in 2014 driven by the continued
strong performance of our FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight businesses and improving performance at FedEx Express. Our expected results for 2014 will be constrained by moderate growth in the global economy and continued challenges from the demand shift
trend from our priority international services to our economy international services. In response to these trends, we will be evaluating additional capacity reductions and other actions in 2014. During 2014 we will incur incremental costs to
transform our information technology operations at FedEx Services in connection with our profit improvement programs, which will increase the costs allocated to our transportation segments. In May 2013, in conjunction with the retirement of
aircraft, FedEx Express shortened the depreciable lives of 76 aircraft and related engines. As a result of this decision and the 2012 decision to shorten the depreciable lives of 54 aircraft, we expect to incur additional year-over-year accelerated
depreciation expense of $74 million in 2014. However, lower pension expense in 2014 will positively impact our operating results.      In addition
to continued profit improvements in the base businesses at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, our profit improvement programs announced in 2013 are targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion at FedEx Express by the end of 2016 (from the
full year 2013 base business). Collectively, these initiatives are expected to increase margins, improve cash flows and increase our competitiveness. However, the amount of benefit ultimately realized will vary depending upon future
customer demand, particularly for priority international services. We expect to begin realizing a portion of the benefits of these programs in 2014; however, the majority of the benefits, including those from our voluntary severance program, will
not occur until 2015 and 2016.

   Our capital expenditures for 2014 are expected to increase to approximately $4.0 billion for additional
aircraft deliveries in 2014 to support our fleet modernization program and continued expansion of the FedEx Ground network. We will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures
generate high returns on investments and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions. For additional details on key 2014 capital projects, refer to the  Capital Resources  and  Liquidity Outlook  sections of this
MD A.      Our outlook is dependent upon a stable pricing environment for fuel, as volatility in fuel prices impacts our fuel surcharge
levels, fuel expense and demand for our services. Historically, our fuel surcharges have largely offset incremental fuel costs; however, volatility in fuel costs may impact earnings because adjustments to our fuel surcharges lag changes in actual
fuel prices paid. Therefore, the trailing impact of adjustments to our fuel surcharges can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term.      As described in Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the  Independent Contractor Model  section of our FedEx Ground segment MD A, we are involved in a number of
lawsuits and other proceedings that challenge the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent contractors. FedEx Ground anticipates continuing changes to its relationships with its owner-operators. The nature, timing and amount of
any changes are dependent on the outcome of numerous future events. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such changes or a meaningful range of potential outcomes, although they could be material. However, we do not believe that
any such changes will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx Ground business.      See  Risk Factors  for a
discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.        Seasonality of
Business        Our businesses are cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenues and earnings. Historically, the
U.S. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia-to-U.S. market, peaks in October and November in advance of the U.S. holiday sales season. Our first and
third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. Normally, the fall is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground, while late December,
June and July are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of December through February is the slowest period. For FedEx Office, the summer months are normally the slowest periods.
Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter.   
      RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE        New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements.      On June 1, 2012, we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) on the presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance requires
companies to report components of comprehensive income by including comprehensive income on the face of the income statement or in a separate statement of comprehensive income. We have adopted this guidance by including a separate statement of
comprehensive income (loss) for the three years ending May 31, 2013 and by including expanded accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, on June 1,
2012, we adopted the FASB s amendments to the fair value measurements and disclosure requirements, which expanded existing disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of our long-term debt.   
         -50-

Table of Contents  

   In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring additional information about reclassification
adjustments out of comprehensive income, including changes in comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of comprehensive income. This new standard is effective for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2014 and
will have no impact on our financial condition or results of operations.      In May 2013, the FASB issued a revised exposure draft outlining
proposed changes to the accounting for leases. Under the revised exposure draft, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease would depend primarily on whether the lessee is expected to consume more
than an insignificant portion of the economic benefits embedded in the underlying asset. A right-of-use asset and a liability to make lease payments will be recognized on the balance sheet for all leases (except short-term leases). The enactment of
this proposal will have a significant impact on our accounting and financial reporting. The FASB has not yet proposed an effective date of this proposal.      We believe that no other new accounting guidance was adopted or issued during 2013 that is relevant to the readers of our financial statements. However, there are numerous new proposals under development
which, if and when enacted, may have a significant impact on our financial reporting.          REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
       FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, form the core of our
reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the following businesses:       

FedEx Express Segment   
      
    FedEx Express (express transportation)     FedEx Trade Networks (air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage)     FedEx SupplyChain
Systems (logistics services)    

FedEx Ground Segment   
      
    FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)     FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator)    

FedEx Freight Segment   
      
    FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)     FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation)    

FedEx Services Segment   
      
    FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office
functions)     FedEx TechConnect (customer service, technical support, billings and
collections)     FedEx Office (document and business services and package acceptance)    
        FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT        The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative and information technology functions in shared services operations that support our transportation businesses and allow us to
obtain synergies from the combination of these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions are performed on a regional basis by FedEx Express and reported in the FedEx Express segment in their natural expense
line items. The FedEx Services segment includes: FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office support to our other companies; FedEx TechConnect, which is responsible for customer service,
technical support, billings and collections for U.S. customers of our major business units; and FedEx Office, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses.
  
         -51-

Table of Contents  

   The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our transportation businesses, and we
allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment (including the net operating results of FedEx Office) to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation businesses in the results of those segments. Within the FedEx
Services segment allocation, the net operating results of FedEx Office, which are an immaterial component of our allocations, are allocated to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as
relative revenues or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx
Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the impact of its total allocated net operating costs on our transportation segments.      The operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying unaudited financial summaries of our transportation segments reflects the allocations from the FedEx Services segment
to the respective transportation segments. The  Intercompany charges  caption also includes charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies and certain other costs such as corporate management fees
related to services received for general corporate oversight, including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions.   
    OTHER INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS     
  Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment. Billings for
such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenues and
expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information, because the amounts are not material.

      FedEx Express Segment Revenues
       FedEx Express segment revenues increased 2% in 2013 primarily due to the impact of new business acquisitions and growth in our
freight-forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks. Core revenue growth was constrained by global economic conditions as revenue growth from higher international export volume was offset by decreased yields due to shifts in demand from our priority
international services to our economy international services, as well as lower rates. In 2013, international domestic revenues increased 64% due to recent acquisitions in Brazil, France and Poland. International export revenues were down in 2013 as
revenue per package decreased 3% due to the demand shift to our lower-yielding economy services and lower rates, while volume increased 3% driven by our economy services. A decrease in U.S. domestic package volumes more than offset an increase in
U.S. domestic package yield, resulting in slightly lower U.S. domestic package revenues in 2013. Total average daily freight pounds decreased 2% in 2013 due to weakness in economic global conditions.   
         -55-

Table of Contents  

   FedEx Express segment revenues increased 8% in 2012 primarily due to an increase in U.S. domestic and
international export package yields, partially offset by decreases in U.S. domestic and international export package volumes. In 2012, U.S. domestic package yields increased 10% due to higher fuel surcharges and increased rate per pound.
International export package yields increased 8% in 2012 due to higher fuel surcharges, increased package weights and increased rate per pound. Continued softness in the global economy resulted in decreased demand for our U.S. domestic and
international export package services in 2012. International export revenue growth was negatively impacted by a lower-yielding mix of services, consisting of growth in deferred services and declines in premium services.   
  Our fuel surcharges are indexed to the spot price for jet fuel. Using this index, the U.S. domestic and outbound fuel surcharge and the international
fuel surcharges ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:       
    In both January 2013 and 2012, we implemented a 5.9% average list price increase for FedEx Express U.S. domestic, U.S.
export and U.S. import services, while we lowered our fuel surcharge index by two percentage points.        FedEx Express Segment Operating
Income        FedEx Express segment operating results were negatively impacted by $405 million of costs associated with our business
realignment program, both directly and through intercompany allocations. Additionally, results for 2013 were negatively impacted by a $100 million impairment charge as a result of the decision to retire 10 aircraft and related engines from
service. FedEx Express incurred $69 million in year-over-year incremental depreciation costs in 2013 due to the decision in 2012 to accelerate the retirement of certain aircraft. Operating income and operating margin also decreased in 2013 due
to the demand shift toward lower-yielding international services. Operating comparisons were also impacted by an aircraft impairment charge in 2012 and a legal reserve accrual reversal as discussed below.   
  Purchased transportation costs increased 28% in 2013 due to recent business acquisitions and costs associated with the expansion of our freight
forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks. Salaries and benefits increased 4% in 2013 due to recent acquisitions and higher pension costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. Other operating expenses increased 9% due to the
impact of recent business acquisitions and the negative year-over-year comparison of the legal reserve accrual reversal in 2012. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 15% in 2013 as a result of aircraft recently placed into service and
accelerated depreciation due to the shortened life of certain aircraft.      FedEx Express aircraft maintenance and repairs costs are largely
driven by aircraft utilization and required periodic maintenance events. When newer aircraft are introduced into our operating fleet, less maintenance costs are incurred. As a part of our fleet modernization program, FedEx Express has retired older,
less efficient aircraft prior to required periodic maintenance events and has introduced newly manufactured aircraft into the fleet. As a result, a decrease in maintenance and repairs costs was experienced in 2013 and 2012.   
  Fuel costs decreased 4% in 2013 due to lower jet fuel prices and lower aircraft fuel usage. Based on a static analysis of the net impact of
year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel had a slightly positive impact in 2013. This analysis considers the estimated impact of the reduction in fuel surcharges included in the base rates
charged for FedEx Express services.   
         -56-

Table of Contents  

   FedEx Express segment operating income increased 3% in 2012 primarily due to the benefit from the timing lag
that exists between when fuel prices change and when indexed fuel surcharges automatically adjust and U.S. domestic and international export package yield improvements. Results of the FedEx Express segment reflect the impact of two one-time items in
2012. FedEx Express segment results for 2012 were negatively impacted by $134 million as a result of the decision to retire from service 18 Airbus A310-200 aircraft and 26 related engines as well as six Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and 17 related engines
to better align the U.S. domestic air network capacity of FedEx Express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. The 2012 operating results at the FedEx Express segment were favorably impacted by the reversal of a legal reserve of $66
million that was initially recorded in 2011. FedEx Express segment results also benefited from a milder winter compared to the negative impact of unusually severe winter weather in 2011.      Salaries and employee benefits increased 5% in 2012 due to higher incentive compensation accruals and the full reinstatement of 401(k) company-matching contributions effective January 1, 2011.
Purchased transportation costs increased 16% in 2012 due to costs associated with the expansion of our freight forwarding business at FedEx Trade Networks, business acquisitions in India and Mexico and higher utilization of third-party
transportation providers, primarily in Europe. Intercompany charges increased 7% in 2012 due to higher allocated variable incentive compensation expenses.      Fuel costs increased 21% in 2012 due to increases in the average price per gallon of fuel. Fuel usage in 2012 was down slightly.        FedEx Express Segment Outlook        We expect revenues and earnings to increase at FedEx
Express during 2014 due to slight growth in our international package and international domestic services. In addition, we expect operating income to improve through ongoing execution of our profit improvement programs including improving yields,
adjusting network capacity and reducing structural costs. However, the demand shift from our priority international services to our economy international services will continue to constrain earnings growth in 2014. Base yields on priority
international services at FedEx Express continue to weaken based on our customers  accelerating preference for our lower-yielding services. Given the persistence of this trend, we will continue evaluating further actions to adjust our FedEx
Express network capacity and shift lower yielding services into lower cost delivery networks.      Capital expenditures at FedEx Express are
expected to increase in 2014 driven by an increase in aircraft investment. We will continue to modernize our aircraft fleet at FedEx Express during 2014 by adding newer aircraft that are more reliable, fuel-efficient and technologically advanced,
and retiring older, less-efficient aircraft. Due to the accelerated retirement of certain aircraft and related engines to aid in modernizing our fleet and improving our global network, we expect an additional $74 million in year-over-year
depreciation expense in 2014.      In April 2013, FedEx Express was selected as the sole awardee of the recent U.S. Postal Service air cargo
solicitation, representing the majority of the United States Postal Service s ( USPS ) air linehaul traffic. This new seven year agreement begins on October 1, 2013. The agreement provides reduced rates for the USPS versus the
prior FedEx Express agreement and offers the opportunity for incremental revenue.

Table of Contents  

     FedEx Ground Segment Revenues        FedEx Ground segment revenues increased 10% during 2013 due to volume increases at both FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost, as well as yield growth at FedEx Ground.   
  FedEx Ground average daily package volume increased 8% during 2013 due to market share gains from continued growth in our FedEx Home Delivery service and
increases in our commercial business. FedEx Ground yield increased 2% in 2013 primarily due to increased rates and higher residential surcharge revenue, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges and package weights.   
  FedEx SmartPost average daily volume grew 22% during 2013 primarily as a result of growth in e-commerce. Yields at FedEx SmartPost decreased 2% during
2013 primarily due to higher postage costs, partially offset by increased rates. FedEx SmartPost yield represents the amount charged to customers net of postage paid to the USPS.      During 2012, FedEx Ground segment revenues increased 13% due to yield and volume growth at both FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost.      FedEx Ground yields increased 7% during 2012 primarily due to rate increases, higher fuel surcharges and higher extra service revenue. Average daily package volume increased 4% at FedEx Ground in 2012 due
to market share gains from continued growth in our FedEx Home Delivery service and an increase in our commercial business.      At FedEx
SmartPost, yields increased 5% in 2012 primarily due to higher fuel surcharges and increased rates, partially offset by an unfavorable service mix. Average daily volume increased 18% at FedEx SmartPost in 2012 as a result of growth in e-commerce.
     The FedEx Ground fuel surcharge is based on a rounded average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel, as
published by the Department of Energy. Our fuel surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:       
    In January 2013 and 2012, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 4.9% average list price increase. The full
average rate increase of 5.9% was partially offset by adjusting the fuel price threshold at which the fuel surcharge begins, reducing the fuel surcharge by one percentage point. FedEx SmartPost rates also increased.   
    FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income        FedEx Ground segment operating income increased 1% during 2013 primarily due to volume growth and higher yields. However, operating margin decreased as the benefit of higher volume and revenue per package
was more than offset by intercompany charges of $105 million associated with the business realignment program and a favorable self-insurance true-up in the prior year. Purchased transportation costs increased 11% in 2013 primarily as a result of
volume growth and higher rates paid to our independent contractors. Other operating expenses increased 18% primarily due to a favorable self-insurance true-up in the prior year and higher legal expenses in the current year. Salaries and employee
benefits expense increased 9% in 2013 primarily due to increased staffing to support volume growth.   
         -59-

Table of Contents  

   FedEx Ground segment operating income increased 33% and operating margin increased 280 basis points during
2012 primarily due to higher yields and volume growth. FedEx Ground has continued to shorten transit times throughout 2012 by accelerating various lanes throughout the U.S. and Canada, while maintaining consistently high on-time service. Purchased
transportation costs increased 10% in 2012 primarily as a result of volume growth and higher fuel surcharges. Salaries and employee benefits increased 13% primarily due to increased staffing to support volume growth and higher incentive compensation
accruals. Intercompany charges increased 9% in 2012 primarily due to higher allocated information technology costs. Depreciation expense increased 15% in 2012 due to higher capital spending across the network, including technology and transportation
equipment upgrades and an initiative to replace lighting fixtures throughout the network in order to reduce energy costs.        Independent
Contractor Model        Although FedEx Ground is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (such as state tax or other
administrative challenges) where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue, a number of recent judicial decisions support our classification, and we believe our relationship with the contractors is generally excellent. For a
description of these proceedings, see  Risk Factors  and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.      For
additional information on the FedEx Ground Independent Service Provider model, see Part 1, Item 1 under the caption  Independent Contractor Model.         FedEx Ground Segment Outlook        FedEx Ground segment revenues and operating income
are expected to continue to grow in 2014, led by volume growth across all our major services due to market share gains. We also anticipate yield growth in 2014 through yield management programs. We will continue to make investments to grow our
highly profitable FedEx Ground network through hub expansion and vehicle and equipment purchases. Earnings growth may be dampened slightly during periods of increased network expansion.      We will continue to vigorously defend various attacks against our independent contractor model and incur ongoing legal costs as a part of this process. While we believe that FedEx Ground s
owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors, it is reasonably possible that we could incur a material loss in connection with one or more of these matters or be required to make material changes to our contractor model.
However, we do not believe that any such changes will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our FedEx Ground business.

       FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT     
  FedEx Freight service offerings include priority services when speed is critical and economy services when time can be traded for savings. The following
tables compare revenues, operating expenses, operating expenses as a percent of revenue, operating income (loss) and operating margin (dollars in millions) and selected statistics for the years ended May 31:

    2013 includes severance costs associated with our voluntary buyout program. 2011 includes severance, impairment and other charges associated with the
combination of our FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations, effective January 30, 2011.          

(3)      
    The direct and indirect charges disclosed in notes (1) and (2) above reduced 2013 operating margin by 90 basis points.

    FedEx Freight introduced Priority and Economy services during the fourth quarter of 2011; therefore, full-year detail has not been presented for 2011.
          FedEx Freight Segment Revenues        FedEx Freight segment revenues increased 2% in 2013 due to higher LTL yield and average daily LTL shipments. LTL yield increased 2% in 2013 due to improvements in FedEx Freight Economy yield resulting
from higher rates and lower weight per LTL shipment. Average daily LTL shipments increased 1% in 2013 driven by our FedEx Freight Economy services offering, partially offset by transitional challenges encountered by some customers in the second half
of 2013 while migrating FedEx Freight functionality to the FedEx enterprise automated platform.      Revenue per hundredweight is a commonly-used
indicator of pricing trends, but this metric can be influenced by many other factors, such as changes in fuel surcharges, weight per shipment, length of haul and the mix of freight. Generally, LTL freight is rated using a standard class system
for the LTL industry and classes are assigned based on transportation characteristics including density, risk and handling. Under the class system, low-value freight that is easy to handle, unlikely to damage and dense will receive lower class
ratings (and lower yields) than expensive, light, bulky freight which is highly susceptible to damage (and produces higher yields). As a result, changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base
rates.      During 2012, FedEx Freight revenues increased 8% due to increased LTL yield and weight per LTL shipment, partially offset by lower
average daily LTL shipments. LTL yield increased 7% during 2012 due to higher fuel surcharges and base yield improvement. Average daily LTL shipments decreased 1% in 2012; however, during the second half of 2012, LTL shipment year-over-year
comparisons improved sequentially (2% in the third quarter and 4% in the fourth quarter) due to enhanced service levels, strong customer satisfaction from our service offerings and the impact of severe weather in the prior year.

   The indexed LTL fuel surcharge is based on the average of the national U.S. on-highway average price for a
gallon of diesel fuel, as published by the Department of Energy. The indexed LTL fuel surcharge ranged as follows for the years ended May 31:       
    On June 10, 2013, FedEx Freight announced it will increase U.S. and certain other shipping rates by an average of
4.5% effective on July 1, 2013. In July 2012, FedEx Freight implemented a rate increase of 6.9% for LTL shipments. In June 2011, FedEx Freight increased the fuel surcharge rate to a maximum of 3.6 percentage points above previous levels.
       FedEx Freight Segment Operating Income        The FedEx Freight segment operating results for 2013 improved as a result of LTL yield growth and increased average daily LTL shipments, along with ongoing improvement in operational efficiencies in our
integrated network. However, operating results for 2013 were negatively impacted by $50 million of costs associated with our business realignment program both directly and through intercompany allocations.   
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased 17% due to continued investment in replacement transportation equipment. Salaries and employee benefits
increased 1% in 2013 primarily due to increases in volume and higher healthcare, workers  compensation and pension costs, partially offset by operational efficiencies and lower incentive compensation. Purchased transportation costs increased 2%
in 2013 due to increased utilization of rail and higher rates, partially offset by a lower cost per mile due to our ability to optimize mode of transportation.      Fuel costs decreased 6% in 2013 due to increased utilization of rail and fuel efficiency improvements. Based on a static analysis of the net impact of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to
year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel had a minimal impact on operating income in 2013.      In 2012, the FedEx Freight segment
operating income increased significantly as a result of higher fuel surcharges, yield growth and ongoing improvements in operational efficiencies due to the combination of our FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations in 2011. Additionally,
the FedEx Freight segment s 2012 results benefited from milder winter weather, while our 2011 results were negatively impacted by unusually severe winter weather.      Purchased transportation costs increased 9% in 2012 due to higher rates and the increased utilization of rail, partially offset by a lower cost per mile due to our ability to optimize mode of
transportation while meeting service standards. Fuel costs increased 9% in 2012 due to a higher average price per gallon of diesel fuel, partially offset by the increased utilization of rail. Based on a static analysis of the net impact of
year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel had a positive impact to operating income in 2012. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 10% in 2012 primarily due to accelerated
depreciation in 2011 associated with the combination of our LTL operations.        FedEx Freight Segment Outlook     
  We expect modest revenue growth at the FedEx Freight segment in 2014 driven by yield and volume initiatives from our differentiated LTL services.
     FedEx Freight operating income and operating margin are expected to increase in 2014 driven by improvements in yields and volume, as well as
continued improvement in productivity and efficiency across our integrated network. We will continue to use investments in technology, focused on network and equipment planning and customer automation, to further enhance customer service levels
throughout 2014.

   Capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to be comparable to 2013, with the majority of our spending for
replacement of vehicles and freight handling equipment.         FINANCIAL CONDITION    
      LIQUIDITY        Cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.9 billion at May 31, 2013, compared to $2.8 billion at May 31, 2012. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods ended
May 31 (in millions):       
     Cash Provided by Operating Activities.  Cash flows from operating activities decreased $147 million in 2013
primarily due to decreased earnings and higher tax, variable compensation and voluntary buyout payments, partially offset by a decrease in pension contributions. Cash flows from operating activities increased $794 million in 2012 primarily due to
increased earnings, partially offset by higher pension contributions. We made contributions of $560 million to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans ( U.S. Pension Plans ) during 2013 and contributions of $722 million to our U.S.
Pension Plans during 2012. We made contributions of $480 million to our U.S. Pension Plans during 2011.       Cash Used in Investing
Activities . Capital expenditures were 16% lower in 2013 largely due to decreased spending at FedEx Express and 17% higher in 2012 primarily due to increased spending at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. See  Capital Resources  for a
discussion of capital expenditures during 2013 and 2012.       Financing Activities . In April 2013, we issued $750 million of senior
unsecured debt under our current shelf registration statement, comprised of $250 million of 2.70% fixed-rate notes due in April 2023 and $500 million of 4.10% fixed rate notes due in April 2043. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually. We
utilized the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. In July 2012, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured debt under a then current shelf registration statement, comprised of $500 million of 2.625% fixed-rate notes due in
August 2022 and $500 million of 3.875% fixed-rate notes due in August 2042. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually. We utilized the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.   
         -64-

Table of Contents  

   During 2013, we made principal payments of $116 million related to capital lease obligations and repaid our
$300 million 9.65% unsecured notes that matured in June 2012 using cash from operations.      During 2013, we repurchased 2.7 million shares
of FedEx common stock at an average price of $91 per share for a total of $246 million. In March 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of common stock. It is expected that the additional share
authorization will primarily be utilized to offset the effects of equity compensation dilution over the next several years. As of May 31, 2013, 10,188,000 shares remained under existing share repurchase authorizations. During 2012, we
repurchased 2.8 
million FedEx common shares at an average price of $70 per share for a total of $197 million.          CAPITAL
RESOURCES        Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology,
facilities, and package-handling and sort equipment. The amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including pre-existing contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new
or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services and actions of regulatory authorities.      The following table compares capital
expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the years ended May 31 (in millions):       
    Capital expenditures during 2013 were lower than the prior year primarily due to decreased spending for aircraft and
related equipment at FedEx Express. Aircraft and aircraft-related equipment purchases at FedEx Express during 2013 included the delivery of 16 Boeing 757s ( B757 ) to be modified for cargo transport and four B777Fs. Capital expenditures
during 2012 were higher than the prior year primarily due to increased spending for vehicles at FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground, although spending for aircraft and related equipment at FedEx Express decreased. Aircraft and
aircraft-related equipment purchases at FedEx Express during 2012 included delivery of seven B777Fs and 15 B757s.         
 LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK        We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $4.9 billion in 2013, cash flow from operations
and available financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditure requirements and debt payment obligations. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2013 includes $420 million
of cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.

   We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock.      A $1 billion
revolving credit facility is available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. In March 2013, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement to, among other things,
extend its maturity date from April 26, 2016 to March 1, 2018. The agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt (long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus
six times our last four fiscal quarters  rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus total common stockholders  investment) that does not exceed 70%. Our leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital was 51% at May 31, 2013.
We believe the leverage ratio covenant is our only significant restrictive covenant in our revolving credit agreement. Our revolving credit agreement contains other customary covenants that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially
restrict the conduct of our business. We are in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant and all other covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do not expect the covenants to affect our operations, including our liquidity or expected
funding needs. As of May 31, 2013, no commercial paper was outstanding, and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit facility was available for future borrowings.      Standard   Poor s has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of BBB and a commercial paper rating of A-2 and a ratings outlook of  stable.  Moody s Investors
Service has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa1 and a commercial paper rating of P-2 and a ratings outlook of  stable.  If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase. If our commercial paper ratings
drop below current levels, we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. If our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become limited.   
  Our capital expenditures are expected to be $4.0 billion in 2014. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our
increased capital expenditures in 2014, which will include spending for aircraft and aircraft-related equipment at FedEx Express, sort facility expansion, primarily at FedEx Ground, and vehicle replacement at all our transportation segments. We
expect approximately 50% of capital expenditures in 2014 will be designated for growth initiatives, predominantly at FedEx Ground and 50% dedicated to maintaining our existing operations. Our expected capital expenditures for 2014 include $1.4
billion in investments for delivery of aircraft, as well as progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express. For 2014, we anticipate making required contributions totaling approximately $650 million to our U.S. Pension Plans.
Our U.S. Pension Plans have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.      We have several aircraft modernization programs underway which are
supported by the purchase of B777F, Boeing 767-300 Freighter ( B767F ) and B757 aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to
achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements. During 2013,
FedEx Express entered into an agreement to purchase 14 additional B757 aircraft, the delivery of which began in 2013 and will continue through 2014. The agreement provides the option to purchase up to 16 additional B757 aircraft, subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions. In addition, FedEx Express entered into agreements to purchase an additional 23 B767F aircraft, the delivery of which will occur between 2014 and 2019. The delivery of two firm B777F aircraft orders were
also deferred from 2015 to 2016.      Effective as of June 14, 2013, FedEx Express entered into a supplemental agreement to purchase 13 of the 16
B757 option aircraft noted above. Delivery of the aircraft will occur during 2014 and 2015.

       CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
       The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2013. Certain of these contractual
obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Except for the current portion of long-term debt, this table does not include
amounts already recorded in our balance sheet as current liabilities at May 31, 2013. We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. These contingent liabilities are not included in the table below. We have other long-term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income taxes, qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement healthcare plan
liabilities and other self-insurance accruals. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Accordingly, this table is not meant to represent a forecast of
our total cash expenditures for any of the periods presented.       
    Open purchase orders that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting
purposes and are not included in the table above. Such purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. See Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.   
   Operating Activities       In accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, future contractual payments under our operating leases (totaling $15 billion on an undiscounted basis) are not recorded in our balance sheet. Credit rating agencies routinely use
information concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. The amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating
leases (principally aircraft and facilities) with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2013. Under the proposed new lease accounting rules, the majority of these leases will be required to be recognized on the balance
sheet as a liability with an offsetting right-to-use asset. In the past, we financed a significant portion of our aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using operating leases (a type of  off-balance sheet financing ). At the
time that the decision to lease was made, we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity or after-tax cash flows.   
  The amounts reflected for purchase obligations represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or services that are not capital-related. Such
contracts include those for printing and advertising and promotions contracts.   
         -67-

Table of Contents  

   Included in the table above within the caption entitled  Non-capital purchase obligations and
other  is our estimate of the current portion of the liability ($1 million) for uncertain tax positions. We cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over
time; therefore, the long-term portion of the liability ($46 million) is excluded from the table. See Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.      The amounts reflected in the table above for interest on long-term debt represent future interest payments due on our long-term debt, all of which are fixed rate.   
   Investing Activities       The amounts
reflected in the table above for capital purchase obligations represent noncancelable agreements to purchase capital-related equipment. Such contracts include those for certain purchases of aircraft, aircraft modifications, vehicles, facilities,
computers and other equipment. Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo transport unless we have entered into noncancelable commitments to modify such aircraft.
      Financing Activities       We
have certain financial instruments representing potential commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit and surety bonds. These
instruments are required under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the normal course of international operations. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our balance sheets, where applicable.
Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves.      The amounts reflected in the table
above for long-term debt represent future scheduled payments on our long-term debt. In 2014, we have scheduled debt payments of $250 million.   
     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES       The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts
reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the
appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new
or better information.      The estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve
the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.          RETIREMENT PLANS     
   OVERVIEW . We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans,
defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans.      Pension benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula
we call the Portable Pension Account. Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on
the notional account balance. The Portable Pension Account benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index and
corporate bond rates. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees.   

         -68-

Table of Contents  

   The current rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce tremendous volatility in our results,
financial condition and liquidity. Our pension expense is primarily a function of the value of our plan assets and the discount rate used to measure our pension liabilities at a single point in time at the end of our fiscal year (the
measurement date). Both of these factors are significantly influenced by the stock and bond markets, which in recent years have experienced substantial volatility.      In addition to expense volatility, we are required to record year-end adjustments to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare
plans. These adjustments have fluctuated significantly over the past several years and like our pension expense, are a result of the discount rate and value of our plan assets at the measurement date. The funded status of our plans also
impacts our liquidity, as current funding laws require increasingly aggressive funding levels for our pension plans. However, the cash funding rules operate under a completely different set of assumptions and standards than those used for financial
reporting purposes, so our actual cash funding requirements can differ materially from our reported funded status. Temporary funding relief was passed in July 2012 that will improve our funded status for those purposes over the next several years.
     Our retirement plans cost is included in the  Salaries and Employee Benefits  caption in our consolidated income statements. A
summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):       
    Total retirement plans cost increased $179 million in 2013 driven by lower discount rates used to measure our benefit
obligations at our May 31, 2012 measurement date. Total retirement plans cost increased $72 million in 2012 primarily due to higher expenses for our 401(k) plans due to the full restoration of company matching contributions on January 1,
2011.      Amounts recognized in our balance sheet reflect a snapshot of the state of our long-term pension liabilities at the plan measurement
date and the effect of year-end accounting on plan assets. Cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses were $7.0 billion through May 31, 2013, compared to $8.9 billion through May 31, 2012. These unrecognized losses reflect changes in the
discount rates and differences between expected and actual asset returns, which are being amortized over future periods. These unrecognized losses may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains. However, unless they are below a corridor
amount, these unrecognized actuarial losses are required to be amortized and recognized in future periods. Our pension expense includes amortization of these actuarial losses of $506 million in 2013, $302 million in 2012 and $276 million in 2011.
      PENSION COST.  The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, including the discount
rate and expected long-term investment returns on plan assets. These assumptions most significantly impact our U.S. Pension Plans.   
         -69-

Table of Contents  

   Following is a discussion of the key estimates we consider in determining our pension cost:   
   DISCOUNT RATE . This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been accrued to date (the projected
benefit obligation, or  PBO ) to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year s pension expense. The discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases pension
expense. The discount rate affects the PBO and pension expense based on the measurement dates, as described below.       
    We determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of
high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better). In developing this theoretical portfolio, we select bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments, limit our concentration by industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to ensure bonds with a
call feature have a low probability of being called. To the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payments in a given period, the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one-year forward rates.   
  The discount rate assumption is highly sensitive, as the following table illustrates for our largest pension plan:   
   
    At our May 31, 2013 measurement date, a 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our 2013
PBO by approximately $1.4 billion and a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our 2013 PBO by approximately $1.5 billion. From 2010 to 2013, the discount rate used to value our liabilities has declined by over 150 basis
points, which increased the valuation of our liabilities by over $3.8 billion.       PLAN ASSETS.  The estimated average rate of return on
plan assets is a long-term, forward-looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is required to be the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in publicly
tradeable securities, and our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. As part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status
volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities.      Establishing the
expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter, which we review on an annual basis and revise as appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:   

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those
investment classes to earn over time; and          

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments
were made strictly in indexed funds.         We have assumed an 8.0% expected long-term rate of return on our U.S. Pension Plan
assets for 2013, 2012 and 2011. The actual returns during each of the last three fiscal years have exceeded that long-term assumption. The actual historical return on our U.S. Pension Plan assets, calculated on a compound geometric basis, was 6.9%,
net of investment manager fees, for the 15-year period ended May 31, 2013 and 7.4%, net of investment manager fees, for the 15-year period ended May 31, 2012. For 2014, we plan to lower our expected return on plan assets assumption for
long-term returns on plan assets to 7.75% as we continue to refine our asset   
         -70-

Table of Contents  

and liability management strategy. In lowering this assumption we considered our historical returns, our investment strategy for our plan assets, including the impacts of the long duration of our
plan liability and the relatively low annual draw on plan assets on that investment strategy. A one-basis-point change in our expected return on plan assets impacts our pension expense by $1.9 million.   
  Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated-value
method to determine the value of plan assets, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and decreases) by amortizing certain actuarial gains or losses over a period no longer than four years. Another method
used in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the measurement date. For purposes of valuing plan assets for determining 2014 pension expense, the calculated value method resulted in the same value as the market value.   
   FUNDED STATUS.  Following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans as of May 31 (in millions):   
   
    Our retirement plans costs are expected to decrease approximately $190 million in 2014 due to significant increases in
the value of our plan assets in 2013 and an increase in our discount rates at our May 31, 2013 measurement date.       FUNDING.  The
funding requirements for our U.S. Pension Plans are governed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which has aggressive funding requirements in order to avoid benefit payment restrictions that become effective if the funded status determined under
IRS rules falls below 80% at the beginning of a plan year. All of our U.S. Pension Plans have funded status levels in excess of 80% and our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to our employees as they come due. Additionally, current
benefit payments are nominal compared to our total plan assets (benefit payments for our U.S. Pension Plans for 2013 were approximately $572 million or 3% of plan assets).      During 2013, we made $560 million in required contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans. Over the past several years, we have made voluntary contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans in excess of the minimum
required contributions. Amounts contributed in excess of the minimum required can result in a credit balance for funding purposes that can be used to reduce minimum contribution requirements in future years. Our current credit balance exceeds $2
billion at May 31, 2013. For 2014, we anticipate making required contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans totaling approximately $650 million.      See Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our retirement plans.          SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS        We are self-insured up to
certain limits for costs associated with workers  compensation claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long-term disability programs. Our reserves are established for estimates
of loss on reported claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims.

   Self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet were $1.7 billion at May 31, 2013, and $1.6
billion at May 31, 2012. Approximately 41% of these accruals were classified as current liabilities.      Our self-insurance accruals are
primarily based on the actuarially estimated, undiscounted cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include consideration of factors such as severity of claims, frequency of claims and future healthcare costs. Cost
trends on material accruals are updated each quarter. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance
and premium expense. Historically, it has been infrequent that incurred claims exceeded our self-insured limits.      We believe the use of
actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims
involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity,
insurance retention levels and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.   
    L  ONG-LIVED ASSETS         PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Our key businesses are capital intensive, with approximately 55% of our total assets invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize
only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards. Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed as
incurred.      The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage
values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether
adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate
our aircraft and other equipment. For our aircraft, we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these assets in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. These estimates affect the
amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future
periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations. Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business
levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control.      In May 2013, FedEx Express
made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 76 aircraft and related engines to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network. In May 2012, we shortened the depreciable lives for 54 aircraft and related engines to accelerate the
retirement of these aircraft, resulting in a depreciation expense increase of $69 million in 2013. As a result of these accelerated retirements, we expect an additional $74 million in year-over-year accelerated depreciation expense in 2014.
     Because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet
requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to
acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. These activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. Aircraft purchases (primarily aircraft in passenger
configuration) that have not been placed in service totaled $129 million at May 31, 2013 and $127 million at May 31, 2012. We plan to modify these assets in the future and place them into operations.

   The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying
value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. We operate integrated transportation networks and, accordingly, cash
flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment. Further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather
than the return on an individual asset. We make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an
impairment charge. Assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. The fair value determinations for such aircraft may
require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft. Such estimates are subject to revision from period to period.      In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall
customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis.
Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including lower capacity needs during our peak shipping
seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; or changes to planned service expansion activities. We currently have one aircraft temporarily idled. This aircraft has been idled for
15 months and is expected to return to revenue service.      In May 2013, we made the decision to retire from service two Airbus A310-200 aircraft
and four related engines, three Airbus A310-300 aircraft and two related engines and five Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and 15 related engines, to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet and improve its global network. As a
consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $100 million ($63 million, net of tax, or $0.20 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.
     In 2012, we incurred a noncash impairment charge of $134 million ($84 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share). This charge related
to our May 2012 decision to permanently retire 24 aircraft and 43 related engines to better align the U.S. domestic air network capacity of FedEx Express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. The majority of these aircraft were
temporarily idled and not in revenue service.       LEASES . We utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities and
equipment. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in  Contractual Cash Obligations  and Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, at May 31, 2013 we had approximately $15 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for payments under operating leases. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at
May 31, 2013 was approximately six years. The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet under current U.S. accounting rules.      The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic
useful life. In addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for
the owner-lessor or, in substance, the owner of the asset during the construction period. We believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to
assist us in making these evaluations.      Under a proposed revision to the accounting standards for leases, we would be required to record an
asset and a liability for our outstanding operating leases similar to the current accounting for capital leases. Notably, the amount we record in the future would be the net present value of our future lease commitments at the date of adoption. This
proposed guidance has not been issued and has been subjected to numerous revisions since the proposal was issued, most recently in May 2013. While we are not required to quantify the effects of the proposed rule changes until these rules are
finalized, we believe that a majority of the operating lease   
         -73-

Table of Contents  

obligations reflected in the contractual cash obligations table would be required to be reflected in our balance sheet were the proposed rules to be adopted. Furthermore, our existing financing
agreements and the rating agencies that evaluate our creditworthiness already take our operating leases into account.       GOODWILL . As of
May 31, 2013, we had $2.8 billion of recorded goodwill from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such
as the expected benefit from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired entity.      In our evaluation of goodwill
impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment which requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative
assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment, including comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value is estimated using
standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach) incorporating market participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital
expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates. We perform our annual impairment tests in
the fourth quarter unless circumstances indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the tests.      Our reporting units with significant
recorded goodwill include our FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Office (reported in the FedEx Services segment) reporting units. We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012. The estimated fair value of each of
these reporting units exceeded their carrying values in 2013 and 2012, and we do not believe that any of these reporting units were at risk as of May 31, 2013.          CONTINGENCIES        We are subject to various loss
contingencies, including tax proceedings and litigation, in connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further,
additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to
account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability, if any. Our material pending loss
contingencies are described in Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of matters not specifically described in Note 18 is not
expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters.       TAX CONTINGENCIES . We are subject to income and operating tax rules of the U.S., its states and municipalities, and of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is
required in determining income tax provisions, as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances and related deferred tax valuation allowances, if necessary, due to the complexity of these rules and their interaction with one another. We account
for income taxes by recording both current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, applied to
taxable income, reduced by applicable tax credits.      Tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the
many jurisdictions in which we operate and are impacted by several factors, including tax audits, appeals, litigation, changes in tax laws and other rules and their interpretations, and changes in our business. We regularly assess the potential
impact of these factors for the current and prior years to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions. We continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust our tax positions, including the current and deferred tax
liabilities, in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. In addition, management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences.   
         -74-

Table of Contents  

   We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is
to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes,
if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must
determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to,
changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related
provision.      We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a
component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and
accrued interest and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in the caption  Other
liabilities  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.      We account for operating taxes based on multi-state, local and foreign
taxing jurisdiction rules in those areas in which we operate. Provisions for operating taxes are estimated based upon these rules, asset acquisitions and disposals, historical spend and other variables. These provisions are consistently evaluated
for reasonableness against compliance and risk factors.      We measure and record operating tax contingency accruals in accordance with
accounting guidance for contingencies. As discussed below, this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated.       OTHER CONTINGENCIES . Because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to
other legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, employment-related claims and FedEx Ground s owner-operators. Accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a
contingency, such as a tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This guidance also
requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management s judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable.   
  During the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible or remote that
a liability has been incurred. A loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. For unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a
potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.      Our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process
designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. The process includes regular
communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of any existing matters.   
         -75-

Table of Contents  

   In determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other
factors:       

the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit (i.e., the lengthy and complex nature of class-action matters);

the procedural status of each lawsuit;          

any opportunities to dispose of the lawsuit on its merits before trial (i.e., motion to dismiss or for summary judgment);      

the amount of time remaining before the trial date;          

the status of discovery;          

the status of settlement, arbitration or mediation proceedings, and;      

our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial.         In reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure, we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the information available prior to the
issuance of our financial statements. Uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency, including a conclusion that we are unable to
establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss. We update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements. However, events may arise that
were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss.      Despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies, we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the
potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure.         RISK FACTORS
      Our financial and operating results are subject to many risks and uncertainties, as described below.   
    We are directly affected by the state of the economy.   While macro-economic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable.
The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods   key
macro-economic measurements. When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies expand the number of distribution centers and move manufacturing closer to consumer markets, we transport goods
shorter distances. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Moreover, as we continue to grow our international business, we are increasingly affected by the
health of the global economy and the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets. In 2013, slower than expected economic growth resulted in a continued customer preference for slower, less costly shipping services, which had a negative
impact on our profitability.        Our businesses depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand.   The FedEx brand
name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong
reputation among customers and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools, and we
devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors or agents, such as customer service mishaps or noncompliance with anti-corruption laws,
could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as YouTube and Twitter, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to
defend against. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to
rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.

       We rely heavily on information and technology to operate our transportation and business
networks, and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm our operations and our reputation among customers.     Our ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon
the sophistication and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers. External and internal risks, such as malware, code anomalies,  Acts of God,  attempts
to penetrate our networks, transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our FedEx enterprise automation platform, data leakage and human error, pose a direct threat to our products, services and data. Any disruption to the
Internet or our complex, global technology infrastructure, including those impacting our computer systems and customer Web sites, could adversely impact our customer service, volumes, and revenues and result in increased costs. These types of
adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company and customer information was compromised due to a data loss by FedEx or a trusted third party. While we have invested and continue to invest in
technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on our operations and financial
results.           Our transportation businesses are impacted by the price and availability of fuel.   We must purchase large
quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. To date, we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel costs
through our indexed fuel surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason, fuel
costs could adversely impact our operating results. Even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higher-yielding express services to our lower-yielding deferred or
ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. In addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation networks.   
    Our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels.   We make significant
investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, package handling facilities, sort equipment, copy equipment and other assets to support our transportation and business networks. We also make significant investments to rebrand, integrate and grow the
companies that we acquire. The amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. We must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed. We
must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. Missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. Overcapacity could lead to
asset dispositions or write-downs and undercapacity could negatively impact service levels. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we made a decision to retire from service certain aircraft and excess aircraft engines and thus recorded a
noncash impairment charge of $100 million.        We face intense competition.   The transportation and business services markets are
both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macro-economic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments,
which enables them to raise capital more easily. We believe we compete effectively with these companies   for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. However, an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability
not only to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), but also to maintain or grow our market share. In addition, high volume package shippers could develop in-house ground delivery
capabilities, which would in turn reduce our revenues and market share. While we believe we compete effectively through our current service offerings, if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or
more effectively bundle their services or our current customers become competitors, it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share.   
         -77-

     If we do not effectively operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses, our financial
results and reputation may suffer.   Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and to realize the benefits we expect when we make those acquisitions.
In furtherance of this strategy, in 2013, we made strategic acquisitions in Poland, France and Brazil. While we expect our past and future acquisitions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our long-term profitability, there can
be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all, or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired businesses, including their goodwill or other intangible assets.
       Labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it
easier for them to do so.   If we are unable to continue to maintain good relationships with our employees and prevent labor organizations from organizing groups of our employees, our operating costs could significantly increase and our
operational flexibility could be significantly reduced. Despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions, other than the pilots of FedEx Express, all of our U.S. employees have thus far chosen not to unionize. The U.S. Congress has, in the
past, considered adopting changes in labor laws, however, that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the purview of
the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the  RLA ). For additional discussion of the RLA, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption  Regulation.  Such legislation could expose our customers
to the type of service disruptions that the RLA was designed to prevent   local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of time-sensitive, high-value goods throughout our global network. Such disruptions could
threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets. There is also the possibility that Congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies, such as FedEx Ground
and FedEx Freight, whose employees are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the  NLRA ). In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the National Labor Relations Board, have and may continue
to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. Finally, changes to federal or state laws governing employee classification could impact the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent
contractors.        FedEx Ground relies on owner-operators to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these
owner-operators as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged.   FedEx Ground s use of independent contractors is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers, as evidenced by the
strong growth of this business segment. We are involved in numerous lawsuits and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that the company s owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as our employees, rather than
independent contractors. We incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators as independent contractors. We believe that FedEx Ground s owner-operators are properly classified as
independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an employer of the drivers of the company s independent contractors. However, adverse determinations in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our owner-operators and
their drivers to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of
FedEx Ground s owner-operators. Changes to state laws governing the definition of independent contractors could impact the status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators. If FedEx Ground is compelled to convert its independent contractors to
employees, labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlays.        Failure to execute on our business realignment program will cause our future financial results to suffer.   In 2013, we announced profit improvement programs primarily through initiatives at
FedEx Express and FedEx Services that include cost reductions, modernization of our aircraft fleet, transformation of the U.S. domestic operations and international profit improvements at FedEx Express, and improved efficiencies and lower costs of
information technology at FedEx Services. To this end, during 2013, we conducted a program to offer voluntary cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. Additionally, we announced in May 2013 our decision to retire
from service 10 aircraft and related engines, as well as to shorten the depreciable lives of an additional 76 aircraft and related engines, in an effort to modernize our aircraft fleet and improve our global network. We will continue to work towards
the plan of annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion by the end of 2016, but if we are not able to reach this goal in the face of challenging economic conditions, our future financial results may suffer.

     The transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities.   Because
transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for
businesses, including those in the transportation industry. For example, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration continues to require FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains
evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our
operations. Thus, it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us. Moreover, a terrorist attack directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt
our operations and adversely impact demand for our services.        The regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation
rights may impact our operations.   Our extensive air network is critical to our success. Our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the Department of Transportation and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the
United States and foreign governments. In addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services. Our operations outside of the United States, such as FedEx Express s growing international
domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx
Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. Regulatory actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation
rights in important international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks.        We may be affected by global climate change
or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.   Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas
( GHG ) emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. For example, during 2009, the European Commission approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) for GHG emissions, to the
airline industry. Under this decision, all FedEx Express flights to and from any airport in any member state of the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount
equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. Because the European Union ETS is being contested by many countries on a number of fronts, and the effective date for parts of the ETS has been delayed until next year, the future impact on us
is unclear. In addition, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially
aircraft or diesel engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at FedEx Express. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our
aircraft or vehicles prematurely. Until the timing, scope and extent of such regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. It is reasonably possible, however, that it could impose material
costs on us. Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce
customer demand for our services, especially our air express services. Finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macro-economic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of
climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems.        A localized disaster in a
key geography could adversely impact our business.   While we operate several integrated networks with assets distributed throughout the world, there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to localized risks from
natural or manmade disasters such as tornados, floods, earthquakes or terrorist attacks. The loss of a key location such as our Memphis super hub or one of our information technology centers could cause a significant disruption to our operations and
cause us to incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. Moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely impact demand for our services.

     Our business may be adversely impacted by disruptions or modifications in service by the USPS.
  The USPS is a significant customer and vendor of FedEx, and thus, disruptions or modifications in services by the USPS as a consequence of the USPS s current financial difficulties or any resulting structural changes to its operations,
network, service offerings or pricing could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.       We are also subject to other
risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including:         

increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare
benefits;          

the increasing costs of compliance with federal and state governmental agency mandates and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement
or other actions by such agencies;          

the impact of any international conflicts on the United States and global economies in general, the transportation industry or us in particular, and
what effects these events will have on our costs or the demand for our services;          

any impacts on our businesses resulting from new domestic or international government laws and regulation;      

changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the Chinese yuan, euro, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and the British pound, which can
affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices;          

market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;      

any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action litigation, such as wage-and-hour and discrimination and retaliation
claims, and any other legal or governmental proceedings;          

the outcome of future negotiations to reach new collective bargaining agreements   including with the union that represents the pilots of FedEx
Express (the current pilot contract became amendable in March 2013, and the parties are currently in negotiations);          

the impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate
unnecessary information technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;          

widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis; and      

availability of financing on terms acceptable to us and our ability to maintain our current credit ratings, especially given the capital intensity of
our operations.            FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL    
   CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended). Our internal control over financial reporting includes, among other things, defined policies and procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated information systems for processing transactions and a properly staffed,
professional internal audit department. Mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and actions are taken to correct all identified deficiencies. Our procedures for financial reporting
include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit Committee and our staff of highly qualified financial and legal professionals.   
  Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of
May 31, 2013, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
     Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2013.
     The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2013, has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst   Young LLP s report on the Company s internal control over
financial reporting is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED    
   PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders      FedEx
Corporation      We have audited FedEx Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2013, based on criteria
established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). FedEx Corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.      We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   
  In our opinion, FedEx Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2013,
based on the COSO criteria.      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of May 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders  investment, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended May 31, 2013 of FedEx Corporation and our report dated July 15, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.      /s/ Ernst   Young LLP      Memphis, Tennessee

    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED    
   PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders      FedEx
Corporation      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation as of May 31, 2013 and 2012, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders  investment, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.      We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of FedEx Corporation at May 31, 2013 and 2012, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), FedEx Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of
May 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 15, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.      /s/ Ernst   Young LLP      Memphis, Tennessee      July 15, 2013

      FEDEX CORPORATION    
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
    NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.  FedEx Corporation ( FedEx ) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and
business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Our primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation ( FedEx Express ), the
world s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ( FedEx Ground ), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight, Inc. ( FedEx Freight ), a
leading North American provider of less-than-truckload ( LTL ) freight services. These companies represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ( FedEx Services ), form the core of our reportable
segments. Our FedEx Services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office support to our transportation segments. In addition, the FedEx Services segment provides customers with retail access to FedEx
Express and FedEx Ground shipping services through FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ( FedEx Office ) and provides customer service, technical support and billing and collection services through FedEx TechConnect, Inc. ( FedEx
TechConnect ).       FISCAL YEARS . Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2013
or ended May 31 of the year referenced.       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of FedEx and its subsidiaries, substantially all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We are not the primary beneficiary of, nor do we have a controlling financial
interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, we have not consolidated any variable interest entity.       REVENUE RECOGNITION . We
recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments for our transportation businesses and upon completion of services for our business services, logistics and trade services businesses. Transportation services are provided with the use of employees and
independent contractors. FedEx is the principal to the transaction for most of these services and revenue from these transactions is recognized on a gross basis. Costs associated with independent contractor settlements are recognized as incurred and
included in the caption  Purchased transportation  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For shipments in transit, revenue is recorded based on the percentage of service completed at the balance sheet date. Estimates for
future billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable are recognized at the time of shipment for money-back service guarantees and billing corrections. Delivery costs are accrued as incurred.   
  Our contract logistics, global trade services and certain transportation businesses, such as FedEx SmartPost, engage in some transactions wherein they
act as agents. Revenue from these transactions is recorded on a net basis. Net revenue includes billings to customers less third-party charges, including transportation or handling costs, fees, commissions, and taxes and duties.   
  Certain of our revenue-producing transactions are subject to taxes, such as sales tax, assessed by governmental authorities. We present these revenues
net of tax.       CREDIT RISK.  We routinely grant credit to many of our customers for transportation and business services without
collateral. The risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of customers, as well as the low revenue per transaction for most of our
services. Allowances for potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience and the impact of current economic factors on the composition of accounts receivable. Historically, credit losses have been within management s
expectations.

FEDEX CORPORATION    
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    
     
    ADVERTISING.  Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in other
operating expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses were $424 million in 2013, $421 million in 2012 and $375 million in 2011.       CASH
EQUIVALENTS.  Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.
      SPARE PARTS, SUPPLIES AND FUEL.  Spare parts (principally aircraft-related) are reported at weighted-average cost. Allowances for
obsolescence are provided for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service. These allowances are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines. Additionally, allowances for
obsolescence are provided for spare parts currently identified as excess or obsolete. These allowances are based on management estimates, which are subject to change. The majority of our supplies and our fuel are reported at weighted average cost.
      PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT . Expenditures for major additions, improvements and flight equipment modifications are capitalized when such
costs are determined to extend the useful life of the asset or are part of the cost of acquiring the asset. Expenditures for equipment overhaul costs of engines or airframes prior to their operational use are capitalized as part of the cost of such
assets as they are costs required to ready the asset for its intended use. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. We capitalize certain direct internal and external costs associated with the development of internal-use software.
Gains and losses on sales of property used in operations are classified within operating expenses.      For financial reporting purposes, we
record depreciation and amortization of property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the asset s service life or related lease term, if shorter. For income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using accelerated methods when
applicable. The depreciable lives and net book value of our property and equipment are as follows (dollars in millions):       
    Substantially all property and equipment have no material residual values. The majority of aircraft costs are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 15 to 30 years. We periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives
and residual values as it did in 2013 and 2012 with certain aircraft. In May 2013, FedEx Express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 76 aircraft and related engines to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network.
In May 2012, we shortened the depreciable lives for 54 aircraft and related engines to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft, resulting in a depreciation expense increase of $69 million in 2013. As a result of these accelerated retirements, we
expect an additional $74 million in year-over-year depreciation expense in 2014.     Depreciation expense, excluding gains and losses on sales of
property and equipment used in operations, was $2.3 billion in 2013, $2.1 billion in 2012 and $1.9 billion in 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of assets under capital lease.

FEDEX CORPORATION    
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    
     
    CAPITALIZED INTEREST . Interest on funds used to finance the acquisition and modification of
aircraft, including purchase deposits, construction of certain facilities, and development of certain software up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use is capitalized and included in the cost of the asset if the asset is actively under
construction. Capitalized interest was $45 million in 2013, $85 million in 2012 and $71 million in 2011.       IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows
associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair
value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.
     We operate integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level,
not at an individual asset level, for our analysis of impairment.      In the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft
and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation
expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in our global economic outlook and the
impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including lower capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; or changes
to planned service expansion activities. We currently have one aircraft temporarily idled. This aircraft has been idled for 15 months and is expected to return to revenue service.      In May 2013, we made the decision to retire from service two Airbus A310-200 aircraft and four related engines, three Airbus A310-300 aircraft and two related engines and five Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and
15 related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet and improve its global network. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $100 million ($63 million, net of tax, or $0.20 per diluted
share) was recorded in the FedEx Express segment in the fourth quarter. All of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.      In May 2012, we made the decision to retire from service 18 Airbus A310-200 aircraft and 26 related engines, as well as six Boeing MD10-10 aircraft and 17 related engines. As a consequence of this
decision, a noncash impairment charge of $134 million ($84 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share) was recorded in the FedEx Express segment in the fourth quarter. The decision to retire these aircraft, the majority of which were
temporarily idled and not in revenue service, better aligns the U.S. domestic air network capacity of FedEx Express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes.      The combination of our FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations was completed on January 30, 2011. These actions resulted in total program costs of $133 million recorded during 2011, which
includes $89 million of impairment and other charges (recorded in the  Business realignment, impairment and other charges  caption on the consolidated income statements), and $44 million of other program costs (primarily recorded in the
 Depreciation and amortization  caption on the consolidated income statements).       GOODWILL.  Goodwill is recognized for the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefit from synergies of the combination and
the existing workforce of the acquired entity. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we would proceed to a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying
value   
         - 93 -

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    

(including attributable goodwill). Fair value for our reporting units is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and management s
assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and expected capital expenditures. Fair value determinations may include both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual
impairment testing in the fourth quarter.       PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS.  Our defined benefit plans are measured using
actuarial techniques that reflect management s assumptions for discount rate, expected long-term investment returns on plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover and future increases in healthcare costs. We
determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of
high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that are designed to match our expected benefit payments in future years. A calculated-value method is employed for purposes of determining the asset values for our tax-qualified U.S.
domestic pension plans ( U.S. Pension Plans ). Our expected rate of return is a judgmental matter which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised as appropriate.      The accounting guidance related to employers  accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit
pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in other comprehensive income ( OCI ) of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. Additionally, the guidance requires the measurement date for plan
assets and liabilities to coincide with the plan sponsor s year end.      At May 31, 2013, we recorded an increase to equity through OCI
of $861 million (net of tax) based primarily on year-end adjustments related to an increase in the value of our plan assets and an increase in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities at May 31, 2013. At May 31, 2012, we recorded
a decrease to equity through OCI of $2.4 billion (net of tax) based primarily on year-end adjustments related to increases in our projected benefit obligation due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities at May 31,
2012.       INCOME TAXES.  Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The liability method is used to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid.
     We recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires
us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of
various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or
circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision.   
  We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax
expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and
penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in the caption  Other liabilities  in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    
     
    SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS.  We are self-insured for costs associated with workers  compensation
claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long-term disability programs. Accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated, undiscounted cost of claims, which includes
incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers  compensation claims, vehicle and general liability, employee healthcare claims and long-term disability are included in accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by
operating company and type of risk. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium expense.       LEASES.  We lease certain aircraft, facilities, equipment and vehicles under capital and operating leases. The commencement date of all leases is the earlier of the date we become legally obligated
to make rent payments or the date we may exercise control over the use of the property. In addition to minimum rental payments, certain leases provide for contingent rentals based on equipment usage principally related to aircraft leases at FedEx
Express and copier usage at FedEx Office. Rent expense associated with contingent rentals is recorded as incurred. Certain of our leases contain fluctuating or escalating payments and rent holiday periods. The related rent expense is recorded on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The cumulative excess of rent payments over rent expense is accounted for as a deferred lease asset and recorded in  Other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative
excess of rent expense over rent payments is accounted for as a deferred lease obligation. Leasehold improvements associated with assets utilized under capital or operating leases are amortized over the shorter of the asset s useful life or the
lease term.       DEFERRED GAINS.  Gains on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and other property and equipment are deferred and amortized
ratably over the life of the lease as a reduction of rent expense. Substantially all of these deferred gains are related to aircraft transactions.       FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  Translation gains and losses of foreign operations that use local currencies as the functional currency are accumulated and reported, net of applicable deferred income
taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within common stockholders  investment. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local
currency are included in the caption  Other, net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and were immaterial for each period presented.       EMPLOYEES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ARRANGEMENTS.  The pilots of FedEx Express, which represent a small number of FedEx Express s total employees, are employed under a collective bargaining
agreement. The contract became amendable in March 2013, and the parties are currently in negotiations. In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain FedEx non-U.S. employees are unionized.   
   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  We recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards under the provisions of the accounting guidance related to
share-based payments. This guidance requires recognition of compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method. We issue new shares or repurchase shares on the open market to cover employee share option exercises and restricted
stock grants. Accordingly, we plan to repurchase approximately 3.7 million shares in 2014.       TREASURY SHARES.  During 2013, we
repurchased 2.7 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $91 per share for a total of $246 million. In March 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of common stock. It is
expected that the additional share authorization will primarily be utilized to offset the effects of equity compensation dilution over the next several years. As of May 31, 2013, 10,188,000 shares remained under existing share repurchase
authorizations.       DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE.  On June 3, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.15 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 1, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2013. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and
we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year.

    BUSINESS REALIGNMENT COSTS . During 2013, we announced profit improvement programs including
reducing our selling, general and administrative cost functions through a voluntary employee separation program.      During 2013, we conducted a
program to offer voluntary cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. The voluntary buyout program includes voluntary severance payments and funding to healthcare reimbursement accounts, with the voluntary severance
calculated based on four weeks of gross base salary for every year of FedEx service up to a maximum payment of two years of pay. This program was completed in the fourth quarter and approximately 3,600 employees have left or will be voluntarily
leaving the company by the end of 2014. Eligible employees are scheduled to vacate positions in phases to ensure a smooth transition in the impacted functions so that we maintain service levels to our customers. Of the total population leaving the
company, approximately 40% of the employees vacated positions on May 31, 2013. An additional 35% will depart throughout 2014 and approximately 25% of this population will remain until May 31, 2014. Costs of the benefits provided under the
voluntary program were recognized as special termination benefits in the period that eligible employees accepted their offers.      We incurred
costs of $560 million ($353 million, net of tax, or $1.11 per diluted share) during 2013 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs related primarily to severance for employees who accepted voluntary buyouts in the third and
fourth quarters of 2013. Payments will be made at the time of departure. Approximately $180 million was paid under this program during 2013. The cost of the buyout program is included in the caption  Business realignment, impairment and other
charges  in our consolidated statements of income. Also included in that caption are other external costs directly attributable to our business realignment activities, such as professional fees.   
   USE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other
information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management.
Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: self-insurance accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive accruals; tax liabilities;
accounts receivable allowances; obsolescence of spare parts; contingent liabilities; loss contingencies, such as litigation and other claims; and impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill).   
    NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE    
   New accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial
statements.      On June 1, 2012, we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
on the presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance requires companies to report components of comprehensive income by including comprehensive income on the face of the income statement or in a separate statement of comprehensive income.
We have adopted this guidance by including a separate statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the three years ending May 31, 2013 and by including expanded accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirements in the notes to our
consolidated financial statements. In addition on June 1, 2012, we adopted the FASB s amendments to the fair value measurements and disclosure requirements, which expanded existing disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of our
long-term debt.      In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring additional information about reclassification adjustments out of
comprehensive income, including changes in comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of comprehensive income. This new standard is effective for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2014 and will have no impact
on our financial condition or results of operations.

   In May 2013, the FASB issued a revised exposure draft outlining proposed changes to the accounting for
leases. Under the revised exposure draft, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease would depend primarily on whether the lessee is expected to consume more than an insignificant portion of the
economic benefits embedded in the underlying asset. A right-of-use asset and a liability to make lease payments will be recognized on the balance sheet for all leases (except short-term leases). The enactment of this proposal will have a significant
impact on our accounting and financial reporting. The FASB has not yet proposed an effective date of this proposal.      We believe that no other
new accounting guidance was adopted or issued during 2013 that is relevant to the readers of our financial statements. However, there are numerous new proposals under development which, if and when enacted, may have a significant impact on our
financial reporting.   
    NOTE 3: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS    
   During 2013, we expanded the international service offerings of FedEx Express by completing the following business acquisitions:

Rapid o Cometa Log stica e Transporte S.A., a Brazilian transportation and logistics company, for $398 million in cash from operations on
July 4, 2012          

TATEX, a French express transportation company, for $55 million in cash from operations on July 3, 2012      

Opek Sp. z o.o., a Polish domestic express package delivery company, for $54 million in cash from operations on June 13, 2012
        These acquisitions give us more robust transportation networks within these countries and added capabilities in these
important international markets.      The financial results of these acquired businesses are included in the FedEx Express segment from the date
of acquisition and were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our results of operations and therefore, pro forma financial information has not been presented.      The estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities related to these acquisitions have been recorded in the FedEx Express segment and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet based
on an allocation of the purchase prices (summarized in the table below in millions).       
    The goodwill of $351 million is primarily attributable to expected benefits from synergies of the combinations with the
existing FedEx Express business and other acquired entities. The portion of the purchase price allocated to goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The intangible assets acquired consist primarily of customer-related intangible
assets, which will be amortized on an accelerated basis over their average estimated useful lives of nine years, with the majority of the amortization recognized during the first five years.

   On June 20, 2013, we signed agreements to acquire the businesses operated by our current service
provider Supaswift (Pty) Ltd. in five countries in Southern Africa. The acquisition will be funded with cash from operations and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014, subject to customary closing conditions. The financial results
of the acquired businesses will be included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of acquisition and will be immaterial to our 2014 results.      In 2012, we completed our acquisition of Servicios Nacionales Mupa, S.A. de C.V. (MultiPack), a Mexican domestic express package delivery company, for $128 million in cash from operations on July 25,
2011. In 2011, FedEx Express completed the acquisition of the Indian logistics, distribution and express businesses of AFL Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliate Unifreight India Pvt. Ltd. for $96 million in cash from operations on February 22, 2011.
The financial results of these acquired businesses are included in the FedEx Express segment from the date of acquisition and were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our results of operations or financial condition and therefore, pro
forma financial information has not been presented. Substantially all of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill, which was entirely attributed to our FedEx Express reporting unit.   
    NOTE 4: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS    
    GOODWILL.  The carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment and changes therein are as follows
(in millions):       

(1)      
    Goodwill acquired in 2012 relates to the acquisition of the Mexican domestic express package delivery company, Multipack. See Note 3 for related
disclosures.          

(2)      
    Primarily currency translation adjustments.          

(3)      
    Goodwill acquired in 2013 relates to the acquisitions of transportation companies in Poland, France and Brazil. See Note 3 for related disclosures.
        Our reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include our FedEx Express, FedEx Freight and FedEx Office (reported
in the FedEx Services segment) reporting units. We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2013. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values in 2013 and 2012, and we do not believe
that any of these reporting units were at risk as of May 31, 2013.       OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  The net book value of our other
intangible assets was $72 million at May 31, 2013 and $34 million at May 31, 2012. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $27 million in 2013, $18 million in 2012 and $32 million in 2011. Estimated amortization expense is expected
to be immaterial in 2014 and beyond.

   The components of selected current liability captions were as follows (in millions):   

NOTE 6: LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS    
   The components of long-term debt (net of discounts), along with maturity dates for the years subsequent to May 31, 2013, are as
follows (in millions):       
    Interest on our fixed-rate notes is paid semi-annually. Long-term debt, exclusive of capital leases, had estimated fair
values of $3.2 billion at May 31, 2013 and $2.0 billion at May 31, 2012. The estimated fair values were determined based on quoted market prices and the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of
our long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. This classification is defined as a fair value determined using market-based inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability, either directly or
indirectly.

   We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us
to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock.      In April 2013, we issued $750
million of senior unsecured debt under our current shelf registration statement, comprised of $250 million of 2.70% fixed-rate notes due in April 2023 and $500 million of 4.10% fixed-rate notes due in April 2043. We utilized the net proceeds for
working capital and general corporate purposes. In July 2012, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured debt under a then current shelf registration statement, comprised of $500 million of 2.625% fixed-rate notes due in August 2022 and $500 million
of 3.875% fixed-rate notes due in August 2042. We utilized the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.      During 2013,
we made principal payments of $116 million related to capital lease obligations and repaid our $300 million 9.65% unsecured notes that matured in June 2012 using cash from operations.      A $1 billion revolving credit facility is available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. On March 1, 2013, we entered into
an amendment to our credit agreement to, among other things, extend its maturity date from April 26, 2016 to March 1, 2018. The agreement contains a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of adjusted debt
(long-term debt, including the current portion of such debt, plus six times our last four fiscal quarters  rentals and landing fees) to capital (adjusted debt plus total common stockholders  investment) that does not exceed 70%. Our
leverage ratio of adjusted debt to capital was 51% at May 31, 2013. We believe the leverage ratio covenant is our only significant restrictive covenant in our revolving credit agreement. Our revolving credit agreement contains other customary
covenants that do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially restrict the conduct of our business. We are in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant and all other covenants of our revolving credit agreement and do not expect the covenants
to affect our operations, including our liquidity or expected funding needs. As of May 31, 2013, no commercial paper was outstanding, and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit facility was available for future borrowings.   
  We issue other financial instruments in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit and surety bonds. We
had a total of $538 million in letters of credit outstanding at May 31, 2013, with $128 million unused under our primary $500 million letter of credit facility, and $539 million in outstanding surety bonds placed by third-party insurance
providers. These instruments are required under certain U.S. self-insurance programs and are also used in the normal course of international operations. The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected in our balance sheets,
where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves.   
    NOTE 7: LEASES    
   We utilize certain aircraft, land, facilities, retail locations and equipment under capital and operating leases that expire at
various dates through 2046. We leased 10% of our total aircraft fleet under operating leases as of May 31, 2013 and 10% of our total aircraft fleet under capital and operating leases as of May 31, 2012. A portion of our supplemental
aircraft are leased by us under agreements that provide for cancellation upon 30 days  notice. Our leased facilities include national, regional and metropolitan sorting facilities, retail facilities and administrative buildings.   
  Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):

   A summary of future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with an initial or
remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2013 is as follows (in millions):       
    Property and equipment recorded under capital leases and future minimum lease payments under capital leases were
immaterial at May 31, 2013. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at May 31, 2013 was approximately six years. While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the use of the leased
assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our lease agreements include material financial covenants or limitations.   
  FedEx Express makes payments under certain leveraged operating leases that are sufficient to pay principal and interest on certain pass-through
certificates. The pass-through certificates are not direct obligations of, or guaranteed by, FedEx or FedEx Express.      We are the lessee in a
series of operating leases covering a portion of our leased aircraft. The lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities. We are not
the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities, as the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to
absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. As such, we are not required to consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure under these leases is included in the summary
of future minimum lease payments shown above.   
    NOTE 8: PREFERRED STOCK    
   Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors, at its discretion, to issue up to 4,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. The stock is issuable in series, which may vary as to certain rights and preferences, and has no par value. As of May 31, 2013, none of these shares had been issued.

statements (in millions):       
 
    NOTE 10: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION    
   Our total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):   
   
    We have two types of equity-based compensation: stock options and restricted stock.   
   STOCK OPTIONS . Under the provisions of our incentive stock plans, key employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase
shares of our common stock at a price not less than its fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting requirements are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Option-vesting periods range from one to
four years, with 83% of our options vesting ratably over four years. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.   
   RESTRICTED STOCK.  Under the terms of our incentive stock plans, restricted shares of our common stock are awarded to key employees. All
restrictions on the shares expire ratably over a four-year period. Shares are valued at the market price on the date of award. The terms of our restricted stock provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employee s retirement. Compensation
expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining service or vesting period.   
   VALUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS . We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. The value of restricted
stock awards is based on the stock price of the award on the grant date. We record stock-based compensation expense in the  Salaries and employee benefits  caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

   The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method include the expected life of the option,
stock price volatility, a risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Following is a table of the weighted-average Black-Scholes value of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of options exercised (in millions), and the key weighted-average
assumptions used in the valuation calculations for the options granted during the years ended May 31, and then a discussion of our methodology for developing each of the assumptions used in the valuation model:   
   
    The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we examine
actual stock option exercises to determine the expected life of the options. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. Expected volatilities are based on the actual changes in the market value of our stock and are calculated using daily
market value changes from the date of grant over a past period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury Strip rate posted at the date of grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option.
The expected dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option.      The following table summarizes
information about stock option activity for the year ended May 31, 2013:

    Only presented for options with market value at May 31, 2013 in excess of the exercise price of the option.

    During the year ended May 31, 2012, there were 214,435 shares of restricted stock granted with a weighted-average
fair value of $88.95. During the year ended May 31, 2011, there were 235,998 shares of restricted stock granted with a weighted-average fair value of $78.74.      The following table summarizes information about stock option vesting during the years ended May 31:       
    As of May 31, 2013, there was $133 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures,
related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. This compensation expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of approximately two years.   
  Total shares outstanding or available for grant related to equity compensation at May 31, 2013 represented 8% of the total outstanding common and
equity compensation shares and equity compensation shares available for grant.

    Net earnings available to participating securities were immaterial in all periods presented.      
    NOTE 12: INCOME TAXES    
   The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended May 31 were as follows (in millions):   
   
    Our current federal income tax expenses in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were significantly reduced by accelerated depreciation
deductions we claimed under provisions of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 and the Tax Relief and the Small Business Jobs Acts of 2010. Those Acts, designed to stimulate new business investment in the U.S., accelerated our depreciation
deductions for new qualifying investments, such as our Boeing 777 Freighter ( B777F ) aircraft. These were timing benefits only, in that depreciation accelerated into an earlier year is foregone in later years. Our 2013 current provision
for federal income taxes was, therefore, higher than in 2012 and 2011.

   Pre-tax (loss) earnings of foreign operations for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $(55) million, $358 million
and $472 million, respectively. These amounts represent only a portion of total results associated with international shipments and accordingly, do not represent our international or domestic results of operations.   
  A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the years ended May 31 was as follows:   
   
    Our 2012 rate was favorably impacted by the conclusion of the IRS audit of our 2007-2009 consolidated income tax returns.
     The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 31 were as follows (in millions):   
   
    The net deferred tax liabilities as of May 31 have been classified in the balance sheets as follows (in millions):
      
    We have $940 million of net operating loss carryovers in various foreign jurisdictions and $500 million of state
operating loss carryovers. The valuation allowances primarily represent amounts reserved for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which expire over varying periods starting in 2014. As a result of this and other factors, we believe
that a substantial portion of these deferred tax assets may not be realized.      Permanently reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
amounted to $1.3 billion at the end of 2013 and $1 billion at the end of 2012. We have not recognized deferred taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes on those earnings. In 2013, our permanent reinvestment strategy with respect to unremitted
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries provided a 1.2% benefit to our effective tax rate. Were the earnings to be distributed, in the form of dividends or otherwise, these earnings could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and non-U.S.
withholding taxes. Unrecognized foreign tax credits potentially could be available to reduce a portion of any

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    

U.S. tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to uncertainties related to the timing and source of any potential
distribution of such funds, along with other important factors such as the amount of associated foreign tax credits. Cash in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy totaled $420 million at the end of 2013 and $410
million at the end of 2012.      In 2013, more than 85% of our total enterprise-wide income was earned in U.S. companies of FedEx that are taxable
in the United States. As a U.S. airline, our FedEx Express unit is required by Federal Aviation Administration and other rules to conduct its air operations, domestic and international, through a U.S. company. However, we serve more than 220
countries and territories around the world, and are required to establish legal entities in many of them. Most of our entities in those countries are operating entities, engaged in picking up and delivering packages and performing other
transportation services. In the meantime, we are continually expanding our global network to meet our customers  needs, which requires increasing investment outside the U.S. We typically use cash generated overseas to fund these investments and
have a foreign holding company which manages our investments in several foreign operating companies, including new acquisitions made in 2013 in Poland, France and Brazil.      We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various U.S. state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010 and 2011 tax years. It is reasonably
possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. The expected impact of any changes would not be material to our consolidated
financial statements.      A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
      
    Our liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions include $42 million at May 31, 2013 and $47 million at
May 31, 2012 associated with positions that if favorably resolved would provide a benefit to our effective tax rate. We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a
component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $29 million on both May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012. Total interest and penalties included in our consolidated statements of income are immaterial.
     It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of
ongoing audits, appeals or litigation in state, local, federal and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between the U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Our liability for uncertain tax positions includes no matters
that are individually or collectively material to us. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months, but an estimate of the
range of the reasonably possible changes cannot be made. However, we do not expect that the resolution of any of our uncertain tax positions will be material.

NOTE 13: RETIREMENT PLANS    
   We sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans,
defined contribution plans and postretirement healthcare plans. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future
salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages. These assumptions most significantly impact our U.S. Pension Plans.      The
accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income
( AOCI ) of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation ( PBO ) of the
plan. We recorded an increase to equity of $861 million (net of tax) at May 31, 2013, and a decrease to equity of $2.4 billion (net of tax) at May 31, 2012, attributable to our plans.   
  A summary of our retirement plans costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):   
   
    Total retirement plans costs in 2013 were higher than 2012 due to the negative impact of a significantly lower discount
rate at our May 31, 2012 measurement date. Total retirement plans cost increased in 2012 primarily due to higher expenses for our 401(k) plans due to the full restoration of company matching contributions on January 1, 2011.   
   PENSION PLANS . Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for
most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account. Under the Portable Pension Account, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on
pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. The Portable Pension Account benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies
from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index and corporate bond rates. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped
on May 31, 2008 for most employees. We also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international employees. The international defined
benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on final earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices.       POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS . Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. U.S. employees covered by the
principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35
if hired on or after January 1, 1988. Postretirement healthcare benefits are capped at 150% of the 1993 per capita projected employer cost, which has been reached and, therefore, these benefits are not subject to additional future
inflation.       PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS.  Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations,
the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

   We use a measurement date of May 31 for our pension and postretirement healthcare plans. Management
reviews the assumptions used to measure pension costs on an annual basis. Economic and market conditions at the measurement date impact these assumptions from year to year. Actuarial gains or losses are generated for changes in assumptions and to
the extent that actual results differ from those assumed. These actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the remaining average service lives of our active employees if they exceed a corridor amount in the aggregate. Additional information about
our pension plans can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ( MD A ) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual
Report ).      Weighted-average actuarial assumptions for our primary U.S. retirement plans, which represent substantially all of our PBO and
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ( APBO ), are as follows:       
    The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is the expected future long-term rate of earnings on plan assets and
is a forward-looking assumption that materially affects our pension cost. Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. We review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and
revise it as appropriate. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption:       

the duration of our pension plan liabilities, which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets;

the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those
investment classes to earn over time; and          

the investment returns we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments
were made strictly in indexed funds.         Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8% for 2013, 2012 and 2011.
Our actual return in each of the past three years exceeded that amount for our principal U.S. domestic pension plan. For the 15-year period ended May 31, 2013, our actual returns were 6.9%. For 2014, we plan to lower our expected return on plan
assets assumption for long-term returns on plan assets to 7.75% as we continue to refine our asset and liability management strategy. In lowering this assumption we considered our historical returns, our investment strategy for our plan assets,
including the impacts of the long duration of our plan liability and the relatively low annual draw on plan assets on that investment strategy.   
  Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated-value
method to determine the value of plan assets, which helps mitigate short-term volatility in market performance (both increases and decreases) by amortizing certain actuarial gains or losses over a period no longer than four years. Another method
used in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the measurement date. For purposes of valuing plan assets for determining 2014 pension expense, the calculated value method resulted in the same value as the market value, as it did in
2013. For determining 2012 pension expense, we used the calculated value method which resulted in a portion of the asset gain in 2011 being deferred to future years because our actual returns on plan assets significantly exceeded our assumptions.

   The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and
private equity portfolios, together with fixed-income portfolios, to earn a long-term investment return that meets our pension plan obligations. Our pension plan assets are invested primarily in publicly tradeable securities, and our pension plans
hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. Our largest holding classes are U.S. Large Cap Equities, which is indexed to the S P 500 Index, Corporate
Fixed Income Securities and Government Fixed Income Securities. Accordingly, we do not have any significant concentrations of risk. Active management strategies are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of
market indices. As part of our strategy to manage pension costs and funded status volatility, we have transitioned to a liability-driven investment strategy to better align plan assets with liabilities. Our investment strategy also includes the
limited use of derivative financial instruments on a discretionary basis to improve investment returns and manage exposure to market risk. In all cases, our investment managers are prohibited from using derivatives for speculative purposes and are
not permitted to use derivatives to leverage a portfolio.      Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments
measured at fair value:       

Cash and cash equivalents . These Level 1 investments include cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. The Level
2 investments include commingled funds valued using the net asset value.          

Domestic and international equities . These Level 1 investments are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on
which the individual securities are traded. The Level 2 investments are commingled funds valued using the net asset value.          

Private equity . The valuation of these Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the
inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments are valued based upon recommendations of our investment managers incorporating factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables
and performance multiples.          

Fixed income . We determine the fair value of these Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities and other fixed income
securities by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.

   Benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid as follows for the
years ending May 31 (millions):       
    These estimates are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from these
estimates.      Future medical benefit claims costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 7.7% during 2014, decreasing to an annual
growth rate of 4.5% in 2029 and thereafter. Future dental benefit costs are estimated to increase at an annual rate of 6.9% during 2014, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 4.5% in 2029 and thereafter. A 1% change in these annual trend rates
would not have a significant impact on the APBO at May 31, 2013 or 2013 benefit expense because the level of these benefits is capped.   
    NOTE 14: BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION    
   FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight represent our major service lines and, along with FedEx Services, form the core of our
reportable segments. Our reportable segments include the following businesses:       

FedEx Express Segment   
      
  FedEx Express (express transportation)   

FedEx Trade Networks (air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage)    

FedEx SupplyChain Systems (logistics services)   

FedEx Ground Segment    
      
  FedEx Ground (small-package ground delivery)   

FedEx SmartPost (small-parcel consolidator)   

FedEx Freight Segment   
      
  FedEx Freight (LTL freight transportation)   

FedEx Custom Critical (time-critical transportation)   

FedEx Services Segment   
      
    FedEx Services (sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office functions)    

FedEx TechConnect (customer service, technical support, billings and collections)    

FedEx Office (document and business services and package acceptance)    
     FedEx Services Segment       The FedEx Services segment operates combined sales, marketing, administrative and information technology functions in shared services operations that support our transportation businesses and allow us to
obtain synergies from the combination of these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions are performed on a regional basis by FedEx Express and reported in the FedEx Express segment in their natural expense
line items. The FedEx Services segment includes: FedEx Services, which provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications and back-office support to our other companies; FedEx TechConnect, which is responsible for customer service,
technical support, billings and collections for U.S. customers of our major business units; and FedEx Office, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses.

   The FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our transportation businesses, and we
allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment (including the net operating results of FedEx Office) to reflect the full cost of operating our transportation businesses in the results of those segments. Within the FedEx
Services segment allocation, the net operating results of FedEx Office, which are an immaterial component of our allocations, are allocated to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as
relative revenues or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx
Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the impact of its total allocated net operating costs on our transportation segments.      The operating expenses line item  Intercompany charges  on the accompanying unaudited financial summaries of our transportation segments in MD A reflects the allocations from the FedEx
Services segment to the respective transportation segments. The  Intercompany charges  caption also includes charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies and certain other costs such as corporate
management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight, including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions.   
   Other Intersegment Transactions    
  Certain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment. Billings for
such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenues and
expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information, because the amounts are not material.

   Cash paid for interest expense and income taxes for the years ended May 31 was as follows (in millions):   

NOTE 16: GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS    
   In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily the lease, sale or purchase of operating assets or services in the ordinary course
of business, we may provide routine guarantees or indemnifications (e.g., environmental, fuel, tax and software infringement), the terms of which range in duration, and often they are not limited and have no specified maximum obligation. As a
result, the overall maximum potential amount of the obligation under such guarantees and indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not been required to make significant payments under our guarantee or indemnification
obligations and no amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of these obligations.      Special
facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to finance the acquisition and construction of various airport facilities and equipment. These facilities were leased to us and are accounted for as operating leases. FedEx
Express has unconditionally guaranteed $551 million in principal of these bonds (with total future principal and interest payments of approximately $708 million as of May 31, 2013) through these leases.   
    NOTE 17: COMMITMENTS    
   Annual purchase commitments under various contracts as of May 31, 2013 were as follows (in millions):

    Primarily vehicles, facilities, advertising contracts and in 2014, approximately $650 million of quarterly contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans.
        The amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or
services. As of May 31, 2013, our obligation to purchase four Boeing 767-300 Freighter ( B767F ) aircraft and nine B777F aircraft is conditioned upon there being no event that causes FedEx Express or its employees not to be
covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended. Commitments to purchase aircraft in passenger configuration do not include the attendant costs to modify these aircraft for cargo transport unless we have entered into noncancelable commitments
to modify such aircraft. Open purchase orders that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes and are not included in the table above.

   We have several aircraft modernization programs underway which are supported by the purchase of B777F,
B767F and Boeing 757 ( B757 ) aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and
to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements. During 2013, FedEx Express entered into an agreement to purchase
14 additional B757 aircraft, the delivery of which began in 2013 and will continue through 2014. The agreement provides the option to purchase up to 16 additional B757 aircraft, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In
addition, FedEx Express entered into agreements to purchase an additional 23 B767F aircraft, the delivery of which will occur between 2014 and 2019. The delivery of two firm B777F aircraft orders were also deferred from 2015 to 2016.   
  We had $414 million in deposits and progress payments as of May 31, 2013 on aircraft purchases and other planned aircraft-related transactions.
These deposits are classified in the  Other assets  caption of our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to our commitment to purchase B777Fs and B767Fs, our aircraft purchase commitments include the B757 aircraft in passenger
configuration, which will require additional costs to modify for cargo transport. Aircraft and aircraft-related contracts are subject to price escalations. The following table is a summary of the key aircraft we are committed to purchase as of
May 31, 2013, with the year of expected delivery:       
    Effective as of June 14, 2013, we entered into a supplemental agreement to purchase 13 of the 16 B757 option aircraft
noted above. Delivery of the aircraft will occur during 2014 and 2015. This aircraft transaction is not included in the table above, as it occurred subsequent to May 31, 2013.   
    NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES    
    Wage-and-Hour.  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits containing various class-action allegations of wage-and-hour
violations. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other things, that they were forced to work  off the clock,  were not paid overtime or were not provided work breaks or other benefits. The complaints generally seek unspecified
monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. We do not believe that a material loss is reasonably possible with respect to any of these matters.       Independent Contractor   Lawsuits and State Administrative Proceedings.  FedEx Ground is involved in numerous class-action lawsuits (including 31 that have been certified as class actions),
individual lawsuits and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that the company s owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors.      Most of the class-action lawsuits were consolidated for administration of the pre-trial proceedings by a single federal court, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. The
multidistrict litigation court granted class certification in 28 cases and denied it in 14 cases. On December 13, 2010, the court entered an opinion and order addressing all outstanding motions for summary judgment on the status of the
owner-operators ( i.e.,  independent contractor vs. employee). In sum, the court has now ruled on our summary judgment motions and entered judgment in favor of FedEx Ground on all claims in 20 of the 28 multidistrict litigation cases that had
been certified as class actions, finding that the owner-operators in those cases were contractors as a matter of the law of 20 states. The plaintiffs filed notices of appeal in all of these 20 cases. The Seventh Circuit heard the appeal in the
Kansas case in January 2012 and, in July 2012, issued an opinion that did not make a determination with respect to the correctness of the district court s decision and, instead, certified two questions to the Kansas Supreme Court related to the
classification of the plaintiffs as independent contractors under the Kansas Wage Payment Act. The other 19 cases that are before the Seventh Circuit remain stayed pending a decision of the Kansas Supreme Court.   
         - 120 -

FEDEX CORPORATION    
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    
     
   The multidistrict litigation court remanded the other eight certified class actions back to the district
courts where they were originally filed because its summary judgment ruling did not completely dispose of all of the claims in those lawsuits. Three of those cases are now on appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The other
five remain pending in their respective district courts.      While the granting of summary judgment in favor of FedEx Ground by the multidistrict
litigation court in 20 of the 28 cases that had been certified as class actions remains subject to appeal, we believe that it significantly improves the likelihood that our independent contractor model will be upheld. Adverse determinations in
matters related to FedEx Ground s independent contractors, however, could, among other things, entitle certain of our owner-operators and their drivers to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result
in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for FedEx Ground, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators in certain jurisdictions. We believe that FedEx Ground s
owner-operators are properly classified as independent contractors and that FedEx Ground is not an employer of the drivers of the company s independent contractors. While it is reasonably possible that potential loss in some of these lawsuits
or such changes to the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground s owner-operators could be material, we cannot yet determine the amount or reasonable range of potential loss. A number of factors contribute to this. The number of plaintiffs
in these lawsuits continues to change, with some being dismissed and others being added and, as to new plaintiffs, discovery is still ongoing. In addition, the parties have conducted only very limited discovery into damages, which could vary
considerably from plaintiff to plaintiff. Further, the range of potential loss could be impacted considerably by future rulings on the merits of certain claims and FedEx Ground s various defenses, and on evidentiary issues. In any event, we do
not believe that a material loss is probable in these matters.      In addition, we are defending contractor-model cases that are not or are no
longer part of the multidistrict litigation, three of which have been certified as class actions. These cases are in varying stages of litigation, and we do not expect to incur a material loss in any of these matters.   
   Other Matters.  In August 2010, a third-party consultant who works with shipping customers to negotiate lower rates filed a lawsuit in federal
district court in California against FedEx and United Parcel Service, Inc. ( UPS ) alleging violations of U.S. antitrust law. This matter was dismissed in May 2011, but the court granted the plaintiff permission to file an amended
complaint, which FedEx received in June 2011. In November 2011, the court granted our motion to dismiss this complaint, but again allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff filed a new complaint in December 2011, and the
matter remains pending before the court. In February 2011, shortly after the initial lawsuit was filed, we received a demand for the production of information and documents in connection with a civil investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice
( DOJ ) into the policies and practices of FedEx and UPS for dealing with third-party consultants who work with shipping customers to negotiate lower rates. In November 2012, the DOJ served a civil investigative demand on the third-party
consultant seeking all pleadings, depositions and documents produced in the lawsuit. We are cooperating with the investigation, do not believe that we have engaged in any anti-competitive activities and will vigorously defend ourselves in any action
that may result from the investigation. While the litigation proceedings and the DOJ investigation move forward, and the amount of loss, if any, is dependent on a number of factors that are not yet fully developed or resolved, we do not believe that
a material loss is reasonably possible.      We have received requests for information from the DOJ in the Northern District of California in
connection with a criminal investigation relating to the transportation of packages for online pharmacies that may have shipped pharmaceuticals in violation of federal law. We responded to grand jury subpoenas issued in June 2008 and August 2009 and
to additional requests for information pursuant to those subpoenas, and we continue to respond and cooperate with the investigation. We believe that our employees have acted in good faith at all times. We do not believe that we have engaged in any
illegal activities and will vigorously defend ourselves in any action that may result from the investigation. The DOJ may pursue a criminal indictment and, if we are convicted, remedies could include fines, penalties, financial forfeiture and
compliance conditions. We cannot estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, as such analysis would depend on facts and law that are not yet fully developed or resolved.

        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        INTEREST RATES.  While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates,
we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long-term debt because the interest rates are fixed on all of our long-term debt. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had outstanding
fixed-rate, long-term debt (exclusive of capital leases) with estimated fair values of $3.2 billion at May 31, 2013 and $2.0 billion at May 31, 2012. Market risk for fixed-rate, long-term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair
value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to $77 million as of May 31, 2013 and $30 million as of May 31, 2012. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market
prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.      We have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and
postretirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact our liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized. Declines in the value of plan assets could
diminish the funded status of our pension plans and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plans. Substantial investment losses on plan assets will also increase pension and postretirement benefit expense in the years
following the losses.       FOREIGN CURRENCY.  While we are a global provider of transportation, e-commerce and business services, the
substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the Chinese yuan, euro, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and the British pound. Historically,
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is more significant with respect to our revenues than our expenses, as a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as aircraft and fuel expenses. During 2013 and 2012,
foreign currency fluctuations had a slightly positive impact on operating income. However, favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services, which is not
quantifiable. At May 31, 2013, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of $132 million for 2014.
This theoretical calculation required under SEC guidelines assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar, which is not consistent with our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In
addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors  services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.   
   COMMODITY.  While we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and vehicle fuel, this risk is largely mitigated by our fuel surcharges
because our fuel surcharges are closely linked to market prices for fuel. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings over the long term.   
  However, our fuel surcharges have a timing lag (approximately six to eight weeks for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground) before they are adjusted for changes
in fuel prices. Our fuel surcharge index also allows fuel prices to fluctuate approximately 2% for FedEx Express and approximately 4% for FedEx Ground before an adjustment to the fuel surcharge occurs. Accordingly, our operating income in a specific
period may be significantly affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a substantial amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges.       OTHER.  We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

   Delivery performance will be measured using the following methodology:   

a.  
  The Postal Service will scan all Handling Units at origin.         

b.  
  The Postal Service will nest all Handling Units into ULDs at origin.         

c.  
  The Postal Service will tender the nested ULDs to the aviation supplier at origin.     

d.  
  The aviation supplier will scan the ULDs with a Possession Scan at origin.     

e.  
  The aviation supplier will scan all Handling Units processed through the sort at the hub.     

f.  
  The aviation supplier will nest all Handling Units to ULDs departing from the hub.     

g.  
  The aviation supplier will scan the ULDs as delivered to the Postal Service upon arrival at destination.     

h.  
  The Postal Service will break the ULDs and scan / de-nest all Handling Units.        Delivery performance will be measured for all ULDs and Handling Units receiving at least a Delivery Scan by the aviation supplier.      The Postal Service will provide data to the aviation supplier via electronic files. The electronic file will show the nested date and time into the ULD, the possession time and date from the aviation
supplier, the delivery time and date from the aviation supplier, and the de-nested break time and date from the Postal Service. Additionally, the files will show the weights of each Handling Unit.   
  Delivery performance on a lane level basis will be calculated as follows:      Total on-time Handling Units, by lane, for the Operating Period, receiving a Delivery Scan      Divided by      Total Handling Units, by lane, for the Operating Period, receiving a
Delivery Scan        Reduction of Payment        If the calculated delivery performance is less than the delivery performance requirement, the late D R tags will be ordered chronologically by the RDT. The percentage of D R tags corresponding to
the difference between [ * ]% and the delivery performance requirement (i.e., [ * ]% (Day Network), [ * ]% (Night Network) or [ * ]% (Peak Operating Period)) will not be assessed a reduction in payment. The remaining late D R tags will be
assessed a reduction in payment as follows:       

a.  
  All Handling Units delivered up to thirty (30) minutes late will be subject to a [ * ]% reduction of the Transportation Payment.     

b.  
  All Handling Units delivered from thirty-one (31) minutes up to one (1) hour to late will be subject to a [ * ]% reduction of the Transportation Payment.

c.  
  All Handling Units delivered 1 hour and one minute late or later will be subject to a [ * ]% reduction of the Transportation Payment.     
  The reduction in payment will be based on a conversion of the weight of the late Handling Units to cubic feet by the applicable mail class density and
will be applied at the base or the tier in which the late delivery occurred.        Performance Management     
  The aviation supplier and the Postal Service will meet once a quarter (at a minimum) to discuss items such as the following:   

a.  
  Cost Control

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 1: Statement of Work          
     Personnel Screening        In general, the Postal Service accepts air carrier security program requirements set forth by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). In addition to these, the Postal Service also mandates
additional requirements.      The Postal Service is aware that the aviation supplier must implement its human resources programs in accordance
with certain state laws and that in that respect there may be certain deviations to the literal application of some of the Postal Service requirements set forth herein.      In the event the aviation supplier establishes that a state law prohibits it from requesting from its employees or prospective employees any or all of the information requested in responses to questions
21a through 21e of PS Form 2025,  Contract Personnel Questionnaire , as required by 1.d below, or from certifying, as the result of a criminal records check, to any of the items requested under 1.b,  Criminal History , below, the aviation
supplier shall be relieved of its contractual obligation to require employees or prospective employees to respond to the portions of those questions requesting the prohibited information or to provide that information as part of its criminal records
check. In these situations, the Postal Service Security Investigations Service Center (SISC) shall conduct the required criminal checks as outlined in 1.b. below.      To establish the existence and the extent of the prohibitory effect of any such state law referenced above, the aviation supplier shall provide to the SISC documentary evidence (including a copy of the
state law) demonstrating the stated prohibition. The Postal Service s concurrence about the prohibitory nature of a state law shall not be unreasonably withheld.      The Contracting Officer may, in consultation with the aviation supplier and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, grant other appropriate deviations or implement alternate processes to the standard U.S.
Postal Inspection Service requirements by letter.        Applicability        Individuals providing services to the Postal Service under this contract (including aviation suppliers, employees of aviation suppliers, and subcontractors and their employees at all levels), hereinafter,
 individuals,  who have been hired after the effective date of this contract and whose duties will or likely may involve handing the mail must obtain a security clearance from the Postal Service, as provided herein. Access to the mail as
defined by 3.a below is permitted as soon as the security clearance package has been submitted to the SISC in Memphis.      If the aviation
supplier commences a new operation (internally or with an aviation supplier) for the purpose of processing Postal volume, the employees hired since the effective date of this contract will be subject to Personnel Screening.   
  Access to the mail is permitted as soon as the security clearance package has been submitted to the SISC in Memphis. If the aviation supplier has ground
handling services performed at air stops by another aviation supplier (subcontractor), and if, to the best knowledge of the prime aviation supplier, that subcontractor is in compliance with the provisions of this clause, the prime aviation supplier
may certify that fact to the Contracting Officer in writing, and thereby be relieved of the primary responsibility for personnel screening. Prime aviation suppliers are in all cases responsible for meeting these screening requirements for all
persons having access to the mail who are their direct employees. For example, if ABC, Inc. is an aviation supplier, and it performs ground handling services at one or more air stops for CDE, Inc., CDE must certify in writing that:   
   I certify that at the following air stops ground handling services are being performed by ABC, and that to the best of my knowledge,
ABC is an aviation supplier of air transportation services under contract number       . A listing of airports served by ABC is attached hereto as follows.       Aviation suppliers must have clauses in their contracts with subcontractors requiring adherence to the Postal Service screening procedures contained in this contract.

     Payment Procedures          Rates and Payment General        The aviation supplier will be compensated based upon
properly scanned ULDs and Handling Units. The payment for each ULD and Handling Unit will be based on the network (i.e., Day or Night) to which the mail is assigned by the Postal Service. This process will allow for automated payment.   
  [ * ]       Scan Requirements    
    All scan requirements listed below are specified in the    Scanning and Data Transmission    section.     
   Night Turn Scan Requirements        

a.  
  Possession Scan of all ULDs and Handling Units at the origin         

b.  
  Delivery Scan of all ULDs and Handling Units delivered at destination         Day Turn Scan Requirements        

a.  
  The aviation supplier will conduct a Possession Scan of all ULDs and Handling Units at the origin.     

b.  
  The aviation supplier will conduct a Nest Scan associating the Handling Unit with a ULD at the hub.     

c.  
  The aviation supplier will conduct a Delivery Scan of all ULDs and Handling Units delivered at destination.     
  The Hub Sort Scans will be paid in accordance with the pricing listed in  Attachment 10: Pricing  for Handling Units sorted at the hub on the Day
Network for which scans are provided. Hub Sort Scans will not be paid for Handling Units assigned to a Bypass ULD or for the Night Network.      [
* ]      The base and tier pricing from  Attachment 10: Pricing  will be applied to the volume measured in each Operating Period as follows.
Volume within the base will be paid at the Base Rate. The portion of volume exceeding the base volume and falling within the Tier 1 volume will be paid at the Tier 1 rate. A similar incremental process will be applied to volume that falls within
subsequent tiers.      Payments will be made by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).      [ * ]      The aviation supplier will bill additional charges not covered within the automated
payments system on a weekly basis. For correct and sufficient invoices received by noon Wednesday of a given week, the Postal Service will process them so as to generate a payment by Wednesday, three (3) weeks following the receipt of the

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 1: Statement of Work          
     Payment Processing Day Network Per Cube     
   Invoicing       All invoices for the
transportation of Handling Units or ULDs under this contract will be paid by the cubic foot and payment will be based on completing the required scans.       Mail Tendered in ULDs       The Line Haul rate for each ULD will be comprised of two components:
Non-Fuel Line Haul and Fuel Line Haul. The Non-Fuel Line Haul rate will include all of the transportation and handling associated with a ULD. Hub Sort Scanning rates are separate from the Non-Fuel Line Haul rate.   
  ULD cubic feet will be paid at the agreed cubic feet size for each ULD type described in  Attachment 10: Pricing .   
  The cubic feet paid will be based on the Postal assigned ULD type. If the Postal ULD type is missing, the aviation supplier s ULD type will be used
for invoicing. Any discrepancies between the types of ULD processed will be resolved during the Reconciliation Process.      The transportation
payment for mixed ULDs will be based on the applicable cubic feet of the originating ULD. These transportation payments will be reduced for Handling Units not receiving a Delivery Scan by converting the weight of the Handling Units without a
Delivery Scan at the correct destination to cubic feet by the applicable mail class density.      The transportation payment for bypass ULDs will
be based on the applicable cubic feet of the originating ULD. These transportation payments will not be made for Bypass ULDs without a Delivery Scan at the correct destination.      Recognizing operational inefficiencies filling the last ULD at every location, the Postal Service will incorporate within the daily invoice a daily credit based on the total cubic feet of the mixed ULDs
in the Operating Plan divided by the total number of mixed ULDs in the Operating Plan for each origin air stop per day multiplied by 50%. The rate used will be the applicable base or tier cubic foot rate used at the beginning of the invoice day.
      Mail Tendered from Surface Trucks       If mail is tendered to the aviation supplier from a defined truck location as identified in  Attachments 3 and 4  at contract award, the invoiced cubic feet will be calculated by dividing the
Handling Unit s Postal Service assigned rounded weight by the applicable mail class density.       Mail Tendered from Ad Hoc Trucks into
the Aviation Supplier Hub       The aviation supplier will accept ad hoc trucks from the Postal Service at the proposed hub locations. The
invoiced cubic feet for ad hoc trucks will be calculated by dividing the Handling Unit s Postal Service assigned rounded weight by the applicable mail class density. Recognizing the reduced work content, the aviation supplier will provide an
unload rate in  Attachment 10: Pricing  for the receipt and processing of all ad hoc truck mail volume. The Postal Service will incorporate ad hoc truck payments in the weekly electronic payment.   
   Aviation Supplier Surface Transportation   Not Included in the Transportation Payment    
  The aviation supplier will include a separate rate per mile for Highway Transportation in  Attachment 10: Pricing  which will be applied when the
Postal Service requires the aviation supplier to operate unplanned surface transportation of mail.       Hub Sort Scan Charge    
  The Postal Service will pay a Hub Sort Scan charge for mail sorted and scanned at a hub per Handling Unit (i.e., D R Tag) as shown in  Attachment
10: Pricing . This rate will not be subject to an increase for the full term of the contract.   
         Page 27 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 1: Statement of Work          
   Handling Units sorted at a hub must receive a Hub Sort Scan for payment purposes. The Postal Service
will not pay a Hub Sort Scan charge for sorts not supported by EDI scan information. The pieces scanned into a tendered Bypass container are not eligible to receive Hub Sort Scan charges.       Re-Labeling Charge       The Postal Service will pay an additional charge to the aviation
supplier for re-labeling Postal Service Handling Units at the hub for which the D R tag is missing or becomes illegible. The Postal Service will also provide all equipment necessary to perform this function. The re-labeling charge per Handling
Unit is shown in  Attachment 10: Pricing .      This rate will not be subject to an increase for the full term of the contract.   
  Payment to the aviation supplier for the transport of re-labeled Handling Units will be based upon data received from the Hub Scan plus (combined and
matched with) the Delivery Scan for the Handling Unit. An average weight per Handling Unit will be established based upon the previous month s data for average weight per Handling Unit, and for Handling Units that are not properly scanned due
to conditions beyond the aviation supplier s control.      The equipment to be supplied by the Postal Service for this function will be
listed in  Attachment 6:  Postal Furnished Property, and will be covered by Clause 2-22,  Postal Service Property .  Attachment 6: Postal Furnished Property  will be created upon successful installation of the equipment. Upon
reasonable advance notice to the aviation supplier, the Postal Service shall be permitted to perform maintenance on any of the equipment located in an aviation supplier s facility listed in  Attachment 6: Postal Service Furnished
Property .       Fuel Adjustment    
  There will be a monthly fuel adjustment to the Fuel Line Haul rate. Each  month  is defined in  Attachment 1: Postal Service Operating
Periods . The adjustment will become effective on the first operating day of each operating period after contract commencement. The adjustment may be upward or downward.      The adjustment will be based on the U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) prices for Kerosene-type jet fuel reported by the U.S. Department of Energy for the month that is two (2) months prior to the adjustment.
The adjustment will be calculated and applied monthly.      For example, assume the Fuel Line Haul rate is $0.10. If the June 20XX USGC price
for Kerosene-type jet fuel is $2.68 per gallon and the July 20XX price is $3.00 per gallon, then the adjustment for September XX would be calculated as follows:      ($3.00 / $2.68) = 1.12      1.12 x $0.10 = $0.11   
  The new Fuel Line Haul rate would be $0.11 per cubic foot.      In August 20XX, if the USGC price is $2.70 per gallon, the calculation for the October 20XX rate would be:      ($2.70 / $3.00) = 0.90      0.90 x $0.11 = $0.10 per cubic foot   
  This calculation will be rounded after the decimal to four digits.      The proposal pricing should be based on the August 2012 U.S. Gulf Coast Kerosene-type jet fuel reported by the U.S. Department of Energy ($3.156 per gallon).   
  Fuel will be adjusted for October 2013 based on the August 2013 U.S. Gulf Coast Kerosene-type jet fuel reported by the U.S. Department of Energy.

     Payment Processing Night Network Per Pound     
   Invoicing       All Handling Units tendered to
the aviation supplier for the Night Network will be paid by the pound and payment will be based on required scanning. The weight will be derived from the assigned rounded weight of the Handling Unit. The Non-Fuel Line Haul rate will include all of
the transportation and handling associated with a Handling Unit. The Fuel Line Haul rate for the Night Network will not be subject to a fuel adjustment.       Re-Labeling Charge       The Postal Service will pay an additional charge to the aviation
supplier for re-labeling Postal Service Handling Units for which the D R tag is missing or becomes illegible. The Postal Service will also provide all equipment necessary to perform this function. The re-labeling charge per Handling Unit is
shown in  Attachment 10: Pricing.  This rate will not be subject to an increase for the full term of the contract.      Payment to the
aviation supplier for transport of re-labeled Handling Units will be based upon data received from the Hub Scan plus (combined and matched with) the Delivery Scan for the Handling Unit. An average weight per Handling Unit will be established based
upon the previous month s data for average weight per Handling Unit and for Handling Units that are not properly scanned due to conditions beyond the aviation supplier s control.      The equipment to be supplied by the Postal Service for this function will be listed in  Attachment 6:  Postal Furnished Property, and will be covered by Clause 2-22,  Postal Service Property .
 Attachment 6  will be created upon successful installation of the equipment. Upon reasonable advance notice to the aviation supplier, the Postal Service shall be permitted to perform maintenance on any of the equipment located in an aviation
supplier s facility listed in  Attachment 6 .      The payment for the Night Network re-labeled Handling Units will be adjusted to
reflect the percentage of re-labeled Handling Units that have already been scanned. This percentage of previously scanned Handling Units will be mutually agreed upon by the Postal Service and the aviation supplier through an audit sampling of
re-labeled Handling Units. Contingency Handling Units are excluded from this adjustment.        Reconciliation Process     
  Reconciliation of scanning and payment records between the Postal Service and the aviation supplier will be conducted in a scheduled meeting attended by
the Postal Service and the aviation supplier on an Operating Period basis not more than ninety (90) days after the close of an Operating Period, or a time frame as agreed mutually by the parties. The following procedures will be observed for
the reconciliation process:       

a.  
  All data exchanges between the aviation supplier and the Postal Service for the reconciliation process will be performed electronically and sent to specified mailboxes
operated by each organization. Each file will have an individually specified transmission interval.         

b.  
  For all files exchanged between the aviation supplier and the Postal Service, any changes to layout or data definition must be communicated to the receiving party at a
minimum of sixty (60) calendar days prior to implementation, or sooner if mutually agreed.         

c.  
  All file transfers must adhere to Postal Service Security and Privacy rules.     

d.  
  Supplemental Charges / Assessments may be assessed each Operating Period. The charges shall include but not be limited to the following:     

i.  
  Operating Period Volume Minimum and Contract Volume Minimum     
         Page 29 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 1: Statement of Work          

ii.  
  Non-achievement of performance standards         

e.  
  Once the parties have mutually agreed on the Operating Period reconciliation, both parties agree that neither can re-open the Operating Period for further adjustments.
By mutually agreeing to the Operating Period reconciliation, the parties thereby agree to waive their right to pursue a claim under the Contract Disputes Act based upon the Operating Period reconciliation.     
  In the event there is a catastrophic equipment or information system failure, the aviation supplier will provide electronic files to the Postal Service
identifying all D R Tags the aviation supplier scanned that were lost. The aviation supplier will notify the Contracting Officer and the COR as soon as the aviation supplier becomes aware of such a failure.   
  If the Postal Service cannot produce D R Tags, an emergency contingency will be developed and implemented. Such a plan will include specifications
for operational and information technology issues, as well as payment.

indefinite quantity with adjustments contract for the purchase of commercial services pursuant to 39 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 601 et seq.      This is not a requirements-type contract.        Clause B-9: Claims and Disputes (March 2006)
(Tailored)         

b.  
  Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or relating to this contract must be resolved under this clause.     

c.  
   Claim,  as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of
money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the aviation supplier seeking the payment of money exceeding
$100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified as required by subparagraph d.2 below. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act. The submission may be converted
to a claim under the Act by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount is not acted upon in a reasonable time.     

d.  

1.  
  A claim by the aviation supplier must be made in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Postal Service against the
aviation supplier is subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.         

2.  
  For aviation supplier claims exceeding $100,000, the aviation supplier must submit with the claim the following certification:     
    I certify that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge
and belief, that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the aviation supplier believes the Postal Service is liable, and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the aviation supplier.

3.  
  The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the aviation supplier with respect to the claim.     

e.  
  For aviation supplier claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the aviation supplier, render a decision within 60 days of
the request. For aviation supplier-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the aviation supplier of the date by which the decision will be made.     

f.  
  The Contracting Officer s decision is final unless the aviation supplier appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.     

g.  
  When a CDA claim is submitted by or against an aviation supplier, the parties shall make a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute, including an exchange of relevant
information toward a mutual resolution. Accordingly, by mutual consent, the parties may agree to use an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process to assist in resolving the claim. A certification as described in d(2) of this clause must be
provided for any claim, regardless of dollar amount, before ADR is used. If either party declares the matter to be at an impasse, the dispute will be resolved through the CDA process as contemplated by Clause B-9.     

h.  
  The Postal Service will pay interest in the amount found due and unpaid from:     

1.  
  The date the Contracting Officer receives the claim (properly certified, if required); or     

2.  
  The date payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment.     

i.  
  Simple interest on claims will be paid at a rate determined in accordance with the  Interest  clause.     

j.  
  The aviation supplier must proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising
under the contract regardless of the initiating party, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.          Clause
B-10: Pricing of Adjustments (March 2006) (Tailored)        When costs are a factor in determining any contract price adjustment under the
Changes clause, the process set forth in Clause 4-1.c will be followed. For any other provision of this contract, the parties agree to use the process set forth in  Attachment 10: Pricing  and in the Payment Processing sections of Part 1 for
negotiating the adjustment.        Clause B-15: Notice of Delay (March 2006) (Tailored)     
  Immediately upon becoming aware of any difficulties that might delay deliveries under this contract, the aviation supplier will notify the Postal Service
in writing. The notification must identify the difficulties, the reasons for them, and the estimated period of delay anticipated. Failure to give notice may preclude later consideration of any request for an extension of contract time.   
    Clause B-22: Interest (March 2006) (Tailored)        The Postal Service will pay interest on late payments and unearned prompt payment discounts in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. 3901 et. seq., as amended by the Prompt Payment Act
Amendments of 1988, P.L. 100-496. The aviation supplier will pay interest on any payment to the Postal Service at a rate equivalent to the prevailing Contract Disputes Act interest rate.

a.  
  Classification of Irregularities     
  The following classifications of irregularities are those that preclude the Postal Service from accomplishing its mission. The damage
caused from these irregularities result in actual damage and degradation to its brand, and therefore, is associated with liquidated damages as stated:       

1.  
  Failure to Protect        Failure to
protect the mail consists of: failure to protect or safeguard the mail from inclement weather, from damage caused by the mechanized sort, from acts of the aviation supplier s employees or contractors, and from loss, depredation, or other
hazards while in the control or custody of the aviation supplier.       

2.  
  Theft of Mail        The theft of
mail can cause immeasurable damage to the Postal Service, both in terms of actual economic loss to our customers and to the competitive standing of our products and services. The aviation supplier will support law enforcement efforts to prevent
theft of mail, and will support enforcement officials in the apprehension of those who may be perpetrating such crimes.       

b.  
  Damages and Liquidated Damages     
  The following liquidated damages for damaged and unprotected mail are applicable to the associated classifications of irregularities:

1.  
  Damaged and Unprotected Mail     
  Liquidated damages may be assessed for damaged and unprotected mail. For purposes of this section, damaged mail will consist of mail
pieces whether inside or outside of Postal Service MTE. This category includes but may not be limited to:       

i.  
  Failure to Protect   Causing Damage to Mail        Failure to protect causing physical damage to the U.S. Mail or MTE for which there may be damage assessed equal to the actual costs incurred by the Postal Service necessary to remedy the situation and
forward the mail onward to its next processing or delivery operation. Such actual costs may include items such as administrative time at an appropriate hourly rate for documenting the irregular condition and implementing the damage, labor time used
to repossess the mail, unpack, sort, dry, repack / repackage, and re-dispatch to a subsequent destination or processing operation.      If actual damages are not ascertainable, a liquidated damage may be assessed as follows, taking into account the actual damage that may typically result from such situations:   

Per Letter Tray:  
        
  [ * ] per letter tray  

Per Flat Tub:  
        
  [ * ] per flat tub  

Per Mail Sack or Pouch:  
        
  [ * ] per sack or pouch  

Per Outside Parcel:

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

ii.  
  Failure to Protect Dropped or Abandoned Pouch or Piece        When U.S. Mail is discovered unprotected in an unsecured location or on the airport ramp, Liquidated Damages may be assessed at $50.00 per incident.   

c.  
  Investigative Costs for Theft of Mail        In cases where a mail theft is committed by the aviation supplier s or its subcontractor s personnel, actual investigative costs to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and/or the Office of the
Inspector General may be assessed as actual damages. These costs will be reasonably determined and may begin accruing only when a specific investigation begins on the basis of probable cause. The costs of routine surveillance not associated with a
specific theft or series of thefts will not be assessed. In addition to allocable investigative expenses, the Postal Service may assess actual damages for loss of product value resulting from insurance claims where payouts to postal customers can be
traced to the incident(s).      In addition to the above, in cases where mail theft occurs and the Postal Service determines that
the aviation supplier s failure to properly execute the mail handling employee screening requirements set forth in the Contract was a proximate cause of the theft, and that by reason of the theft it is necessary to conduct a complete audit of
the aviation supplier s adherence to the screening requirements with respect to the employment of other employees subject to those requirements, the Postal Service may assess an administrative damage in the amount of $5,000 in lieu of actual
costs associated with that audit.      Depending upon the circumstances of the incident, the Vice President, Network Operations, in
consultation with the Postal Inspection Service or Office of the Inspector General, and the Contracting Officer, may determine that damages pursuant to this section are not appropriate, and may waive all or a portion of the amounts that may
otherwise be due the Postal Service hereunder. Factors such as the seriousness of the misconduct, the aviation supplier s level of cooperation in investigations, implementing corrective actions, and efforts directed at loss recovery will be
considered in reaching that determination.        Clause B-80: Laws and Regulations Applicable (March 2006) (Tailored)     
  This contract and the services performed under it are subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The aviation supplier
assumes sole responsibility to faithfully discharge all duties and obligations imposed by such laws and regulations, and shall obtain and pay for all permits, licenses, and other authorities required to perform this contract. The aviation supplier
shall hold harmless, save, and defend the Postal Service from any consequence of the aviation supplier s failure to abide by all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations (including but not limited to regulations promulgated by
the DOL and IRS) relating to the contract and throughout the term of the contract and any subsequent renewal periods.        Clause B-81:
Information or Access by Third Parties (March 2006) (Tailored)        The Postal Service retains exclusive authority to release any or all
information about mail matter in the custody of the aviation supplier and to permit access to that mail in the custody of the aviation supplier. All requests by non-postal individuals for information about mail matter in the custody of the aviation
supplier or for access to mail in the custody of the aviation supplier must be referred to the Contracting Officer or his or her designee.   
    Clause B-82: Access by Officials (March 2006) (Tailored)        The aviation supplier shall deny access to the cargo compartment of aircrafts or a vehicle containing mail therein to state or local officials except at a postal facility or in the presence of a postal
employee or a Postal Inspection Service officer, unless to prevent immediate damage to the aircraft, vehicle, or their contents. If authorized Federal law enforcement seeks access to the cargo compartment of aircrafts or vehicles contained mail
therein, the aviation supplier shall notify the Postal Inspection Service before permitting access, unless to prevent immediate damage to the aircraft, vehicle, or their contents.

3.  
   Security Plan . When applicable, and unless waived in writing by the Contracting Officer, the aviation supplier must work with the Postal Service to develop and
implement a security plan that addresses the protection of customer or employee information. The plan will be incorporated into the contract and followed by the aviation supplier, and must, at a minimum, address notification to the Postal Service of
any security breach. If the contract does not include a security plan at the time of contract award, it must be added within 60 days after contract award.         

4.  
   Breach Notification . If there is a breach of any nature in the security of Postal Service data, including customer or employee data, the aviation supplier must

Postal Service and must adhere to the Postal Service policies set out in Postal Service Management Instruction AS-350-2004-4, Marketing E-mail. Aviation suppliers wishing to conduct marketing email campaigns to postal employees must first obtain the
prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.

records relating to the services provided under this agreement. The aviation supplier must turn over all such records upon request but may retain copies of documents produced by the aviation supplier.   
    Clause 6-1: Contracting Officer s Representative (March 2006)        The Contracting Officer will appoint a Contracting Officer s representative (COR), responsible for the day-to-day administration of the contract, who will serve as the Postal Service s point of

workweek on work subject to the provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, unless the laborer or mechanic receives compensation at a rate not less than one-and-one-half times the laborer s or mechanic s basic rate of
pay for all such hours worked in excess of 40 hours.         

b.  
   Violation, Liability for Unpaid Wages, and Liquidated Damages . In the event of any violation of paragraph a above, the aviation supplier and any subcontractor

each day on which the employee was required or permitted to work in violation of paragraph a above.         

c.  
   Withholding for Unpaid Wages and Liquidated Damages . The Contracting Officer may withhold from the aviation supplier, from any moneys payable to the aviation
supplier or subcontractor under this or any other contract with the same aviation supplier, or any other federally assisted contract subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act held by the same aviation supplier, sums as may
administratively be determined necessary to satisfy any liabilities of the aviation supplier or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages pursuant to paragraph b above.     

d.  
   Records . The aviation supplier or subcontractor must maintain for 3 years from the completion of the contract for each laborer and mechanic (including watchmen
and guards) working on the contract payroll records which contain the name, address, social security number, and classification(s) of each such employee, hourly rates of wages paid, number of daily and weekly hours worked, deductions made, and
actual wages paid. The aviation supplier or subcontractor must make these records available for inspection, copying, or transcription by authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer and the Department of Labor, and must permit such
representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job. (The Department of Labor information collection and record keeping requirements in this paragraph d have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control
numbers 1215-0140 and 1215-0017.)         

e.  
   Subcontracts . The aviation supplier must insert paragraphs a through d of this clause in all subcontracts, and must require their inclusion in all subcontracts
at any tier.          Clause 9-7: Equal Opportunity (March 2006) (Tailored)     
  During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows:   

1.  
  The contractor may not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The contractor will take
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following:
Employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in
conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the Contracting Officer setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.     

2.  
  The contractor, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive
consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

3.  
  The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a
notice, provided by the agency Contracting Officer, advising the labor union or workers  representative of the contractor s commitments under section 202 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and must post copies of the
notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.         

4.  
  The contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order (EO) 11246 of September 24, 1965, as amended, and of the rules, regulations, and relevant orders
of the Secretary of Labor.         

5.  
  The contractor will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order, 11246 of September 24, 1964, and by the rules, regulations, and orders of the
Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to his books, records, and accounts by the contracting agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations, and orders.

6.  
  In the event of the contractor s non-compliance with the non-discrimination clauses of this contract or with any of such rules, regulations, or orders, this
contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended, in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and
such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.     

7.  
  The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7) in every subcontract or purchase order under this contract unless exempted by rules,
regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with
respect to any subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance,  provided ,  however , that in the event the contractor becomes
involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interest of the United States.
         Clause 9-9: Equal Opportunity Preaward Compliance of Subcontracts (March 2006) (Tailored)     
  The aviation supplier may not enter into a first-tier subcontract for an estimated or actual amount of $1 million or more without obtaining in writing
from the Contracting Officer a clearance that the proposed subcontractor is in compliance with equal opportunity requirements and therefore eligible for award.        Clause 9-10: Service Contract Act (March 2006)         

a.  
  This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended (41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.), and to the following provisions and all other applicable provisions of
the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor issued under the Act (29 CFR Part 4).         

b.  

1)  
  Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the aviation supplier or any subcontractor must be: a) paid not less than the minimum monetary
wages and b) furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor or an authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.     

         Page 55 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

a)  
  If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contracting Officer must require that any class of service employees not listed in it and to be employed under
the contract (that is, the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) be classified by the aviation supplier so as to provide a reasonable relationship (that is, appropriate level of skill
comparison) between the unlisted classifications and the classifications in the wage determination. The conformed class of employees must be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits determined under this clause. (The information
collection requirements contained in this paragraph b have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)         

b)  
  The conforming procedure must be initiated by the aviation supplier before the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees. A written report of the
proposed conforming action, including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved or, if there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves, must be submitted by the
aviation supplier to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employees performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer must review the proposed action and promptly submit a report of it, together with the
agency s recommendation and all pertinent information, including the position of the aviation supplier and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. Within 30 days
of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action, render a final determination in the event of disagreement, or notify the Contracting Officer that additional time is necessary.     

c)  
  The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division will be transmitted to the Contracting Officer, who must promptly notify the aviation
supplier of the action taken. The aviation supplier must give each affected employee a written copy of this determination, or it must be posted as a part of the wage determination.     

d)  

i.  
  The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates bearing a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single
formula. The approach used may vary from determination to determination, depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices ranking various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job
factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way various jobs are rated under federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same
locality. Basic to the establishment of conformable wage rates is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications on the basis of the skill required and the duties performed.     
         Page 56 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

ii.  
  If a contract is modified or extended or an option is exercised, or if a contract succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously
conformed pursuant to this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (that is, adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average
(mean) percentage increase change in the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract that are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the
previously applicable wage determination. If these conforming actions are accomplished before the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the aviation supplier must advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken, but the
other procedures in b.2(c) above need not be followed.         

iii.  
  No employee engaged in performing work on this contract may be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended.         

e)  
  The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined pursuant to b.2(a) and (b) above must be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first
day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date the class
of employees began contract work is a violation of the Service Contract Act and this contract.         

f)  
  Upon discovery of failure to comply with b.2(a) through (e) above, the Wage and Hour Division will make a final determination of conformed classification, wage
rate, and / or fringe benefits that will be retroactive to the date the class of employees commenced contract work.         

3)  
  If, as authorized pursuant to section 4(d) of the Service Contract Act, the term of this contract is more than one year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits
required to be paid or furnished to service employees will be subject to adjustment after one year and not less often than once every two years, pursuant to wage determinations to be issued by the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards
Administration of the Department of Labor.         

c.  
  The aviation supplier or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined conformably to it by furnishing
any equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential payments in cash in accordance with the applicable rules set forth in Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4, and not otherwise.     

d.  

1)  
  In the absence of a minimum-wage attachment for this contract, neither the aviation supplier nor any subcontractor under this contract may pay any person performing
work under the contract (regardless of whether they are service employees) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this provision relieves the aviation supplier or any subcontractor
of any other obligation under law or contract for the payment of a higher wage to any employee.     
         Page 57 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          
   2)       

a)  
  If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Service Contract Act, under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality, and service
employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the aviation
supplier nor any subcontractor under this contract may pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not the employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits
provided for in the agreement, to which the employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under the
agreement.         

b)  
  No aviation supplier or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of section 4.1(b) of 29 CFR Part 4 apply or
unless the Secretary of Labor or an authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in section 4.10 of 29 CFR Part 4, that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in the agreement vary substantially from those prevailing for
services of a similar character in the locality, or determines, as provided in section 4.11 of 29 CFR Part 4, that the agreement applicable to service employees under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm s-length
negotiations.         

c)  
  If it is found in accordance with the review procedures in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that wages and/or fringe benefits in a predecessor aviation
supplier s collective bargaining agreement vary substantially from those prevailing for services of a similar character in the locality, and/or that the agreement applicable to service employees under the predecessor contract was not entered
into as a result of arm s-length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. This determination will be made part of the contract or subcontract, in
accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Board of Service Contract Appeals, as the case may be, irrespective of whether its issuance occurs before or after award (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case
of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, it will be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision.     

e.  
  The aviation supplier and any subcontractor under this contract must notify each service employee starting work on the contract of the minimum monetary wage and any
fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to the contract, or must post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) must be posted in a prominent and accessible place at
the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)     

f.  
  The aviation supplier or subcontractor may not permit services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions
provided by or under the control or supervision of the aviation supplier or subcontractor that are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees engaged to furnish these services, and the aviation supplier or
subcontractor must comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925.

   g.       

1)  
  The aviation supplier and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act must maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work records containing the
information specified in (a) through (f) following for each employee subject to the Service Contract Act and must make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment
Standards Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor (approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control numbers 1215-0017 and 1215-0150):     

a)  
  Name, address, and social security number of each employee.         

b)  
  The correct work classification, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of fringe benefit payments in lieu thereof, and total
daily and weekly compensation of each employee.         

c)  
  The number of daily and weekly hours so worked by each employee.         

d)  
  Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.     

e)  
  A list of monetary wages and fringe benefits for those classes of service employees not included in the wage determination attached to this contract but for whom wage
rates or fringe benefits have been determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative pursuant to paragraph b above. A copy of the report required by b.2(b) above is such a list.     

f)  
  Any list of the predecessor aviation supplier s employees furnished to the aviation supplier pursuant to section 4.6(1)(2) of 29 CFR Part 4.

2)  
  The aviation supplier must also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.

3)  
  Failure to make and maintain or to make available the records specified in this paragraph g for inspection and transcription is a violation of the regulations and this
contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification of the aviation supplier, must take action to suspend any further payment or advance of funds until
the violation ceases.         

4)  
  The aviation supplier must permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working
hours.         

h.  
  The aviation supplier must unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Service Contract Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction
(except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. Payments must be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay
period under the Act may not be of any duration longer than semimonthly.         

i.  
    The Contracting Officer must withhold or cause to be withheld from the Postal Service aviation supplier under this or any other contract with the
aviation supplier such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the aviation supplier or subcontractor. In the event of failure to
pay employees subject to the Act wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Postal Service may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the aviation supplier, suspend any further

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

payment or advance of funds until the violations cease. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the
contract work. In this event, the Postal Service may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the aviation supplier in default with any additional cost.     

j.  
  The aviation supplier agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. The term  aviation supplier,  as used in this clause in any
subcontract, is deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term  aviation supplier.          

k.  
  Service employee means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional
capacity, as those terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29,  Code of Federal Regulations , as of July 30, 1976, and any subsequent revision of those regulations. The term includes all such persons regardless of any contractual
relationship that may be alleged to exist between an aviation supplier or subcontractor and them.        l.   

1)  
  If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished service employees employed by the aviation supplier or a subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a
collective bargaining agreement that is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the aviation supplier must report this fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and
accrual of these wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and furnish a copy of the agreement. The report must be made upon starting performance of the contract, in the
case of collective bargaining agreements effective at the time. In the case of agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance, they must be reported promptly after their
negotiation. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)         

2)  
  Not less than 10 days before completion of any contract being performed at a Postal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of a succeeding
contract and subject to a wage determination containing vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a aviation supplier (predecessor) or successor (section 4.173 of Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), the incumbent aviation
supplier must furnish to the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the aviation supplier s or subcontractor s payroll during the last month of contract performance. The list must also contain
anniversary dates of employment on the contract, either with the current or predecessor aviation suppliers of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer must turn over this list to the successor aviation supplier at the commencement of the
succeeding contract. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)         

m.  
  Rulings and interpretations of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4.     
  n.       

1)  
  By entering into this contract, the aviation supplier and its officials certify that neither they nor any person or firm with a substantial interest in the aviation

o.  
  Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and
exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act before its amendment by Public Law 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of government business:

1)  
  Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, or physical or mental deficiency or injury may be employed at wages lower than the
minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Service Contract Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and
procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator
(29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).         

2)  
  The Administrator will issue certificates under the Service Contract Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped
clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two Acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe
benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).     

3)  
  The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in Parts 525 and 528 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal
Regulations.         

p.  
  Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide
apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a state, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, Employment
and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee not registered as an apprentice in an approved program must be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman
classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices may not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman s rate
contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification may not be greater than the ratio permitted to the aviation supplier for its entire workforce
under the registered program.         

q.  
  An employee engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month tips may have the amount of tips credited by the
employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of this credit may not exceed $1.24 per
hour beginning January 1, 1980, and $1.34 per hour after December 31, 1980. To utilize this proviso:         

1)  
  The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized;     
         Page 61 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

2)  
  The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips
received);         

3)  
  The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct
wages and tip credit (approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1214-0017); and         

4)  
  The use of tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act.

r.  
  Disputes arising out of the labor standards provisions of this contract are not subject to the  Claims and Disputes  clause but must be resolved in accordance with
the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR Parts 4, 6, and 8. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the aviation supplier (or any of its subcontractors) and the Postal Service, the U.S. Department of
Labor, or the employees or their representatives.          Clause 9-12: Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract
Act Price Adjustment (February 2010)         

a.  
  The aviation supplier warrants that the contract prices do not include allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for which adjustment is provided under
this clause.         

b.  
  The minimum prevailing wage determination, including fringe benefits, issued under the Service Contract Act of 1965 by the Department of Labor (DOL), current at least
every two years after the original award date, current at the beginning of any option or renewal period, or in the case of a significant change in labor requirements, applies to this contract and any exercise of an option or renewal of this
contract. When no such determination has been made as applied to this contract, the minimum wage established in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to any exercise of an option or renewal of this contract.     

c.  
  When, as a result of the determination of minimum prevailing wages and fringe benefits applicable (1) every two years after original award date, (2) at the
beginning of any option or renewal period, or (3) in the case of a significant change in labor requirements, an increased or decreased wage determination is applied to this contract, or when as a result of any amendment to the Fair Labor
Standards Act enacted after award that affects minimum wage, and whenever such a determination becomes applicable to this contract under law, the aviation supplier increases or decreases wages or fringe benefits of employees working on the contract
to comply, the aviation supplier and the Contracting Officer will negotiate whether and to what extent either party will absorb the costs of the wage change. Any resulting change in contract price is limited to increases or decreases in wages or
fringe benefits, and the concomitant increases or decreases in Social Security, unemployment taxes, and workers  compensation insurance, but may not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.

d.  
  The aviation supplier or Contracting Officer may request a contract price adjustment within 30 days of the effective date of a wage change. If a request for contract
price adjustment has been made, and the parties have not reached an agreement within thirty days of that request, the Contracting Officer should issue a unilateral change order in the amount considered to be a fair and equitable adjustment. The
aviation supplier may then either accept the amount, or the aviation supplier may file a claim under Clause B-9:  Claims and Disputes  unless the Contracting Officer and aviation supplier extend this period in writing. Upon agreement of the
parties, the contract price or unit price labor rates will be modified in writing. Pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date, the aviation supplier must continue performance.

right to examine any directly pertinent books, papers, and records of the aviation supplier.          Clause 9-13: Affirmative

relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to the act.         

d.  
  The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices in a form to be prescribed by the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs, provided by or through the Contracting Officer. Such notices shall state the rights of applicants and employees as well as the contractor s obligation under the law to take affirmative action
to employ and advance in employment qualified employees and applicants with disabilities. The contractor must ensure that applicants and employees with disabilities are informed of the contents of the notice (e.g., the contractor may have the notice
read to a visually disabled individual, or may lower the posted notice so that it might be read by a person in a wheelchair).         

e.  
  The contractor will notify each labor organization or representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other understanding that the
contractor is bound by the terms of section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is committed to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment individuals with physical or mental disabilities.

orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to section 503 of the Act, as amended, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs may direct to enforce such provisions, including action for noncompliance.          Clause 9-14: Equal Opportunity for Disabled Veterans, Recently Separated Veterans, Other Protected Veterans, and Armed Forces Service Medal Veterans (February 2010) (Tailored)     

a.  
  The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because he or she is a disabled veteran, recently separated veteran, other
protected veteran, or Armed Forces service medal veteran in regard to any position for which the employee or applicant for employment is qualified. The contractor agrees to take affirmative action to employ, advance in employment and otherwise treat

of this contract, including those not generated by this contract and including those occurring at an establishment of the contractor other than the one where the contract is being performed, but excluding those of independently operated corporate
affiliates, with the appropriate employment service delivery system where the opening occurs. Listing employment openings with the state workforce agency job bank or with the local employment service delivery system where the opening occurs will
satisfy the requirement to list jobs with the appropriate employment service delivery system.     
         Page 64 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

c.  
  Listing of employment openings with the appropriate employment service delivery system pursuant to this clause shall be made at least concurrently with the use of any
other recruitment source or effort and shall involve the normal obligations which attach to the placing of a  bona fide  job order, including the acceptance of referrals of veterans and nonveterans. The listing of employment openings does not
require the hiring of any particular job applicants or from any particular group of job applicants, and nothing herein is intended to relieve the contractor from any requirements in Executive orders or regulations regarding nondiscrimination in
employment.         

d.  
  Whenever a contractor, other than a state or local governmental contractor, becomes contractually bound to the listing provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this clause,
it shall advise the state workforce agency in each state where it has establishments of the name and location of each hiring location in the state. As long as the contractor is contractually bound to these provisions and has so advised the state
agency, there is no need to advise the state agency of subsequent contracts. The contractor may advise the state agency when it is no longer bound by this contract clause.     

e.  
  The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this clause do not apply to the listing of employment openings which occur and are filled outside of the 50 states, the District
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Wake Island, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands.     

f.  
  As used in this clause:         

1.  
   All employment openings  includes all positions except executive and senior management, those positions that will be filled from within the contractor s
organization, and positions lasting three days or less. This term includes full-time employment, temporary employment of more than three days  duration, and part-time employment.     

2.  
   Executive and senior management  means: (1) Any employee (a) compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week (or $380 per week,
if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities; (b) whose primary duty is management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or of a customarily
recognized department or subdivision thereof; (c) who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees; and (d) who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to
the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight; or (2) any employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity interest in the enterprise in which the employee is
employed, regardless of whether the business is a corporate or other type of organization, and who is actively engaged in its management.         

3.  
   Positions that will be filled from within the contractor s organization  means employment openings for which no consideration will be given to persons
outside the contractor s organization (including any affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies) and includes any openings which the contractor proposes to fill from regularly established  recall  lists. The exception does not
apply to a particular opening once an employer decides to consider applicants outside of his or her own organization.         

g.  
  The contractor agrees to comply with the rules, regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to the Act.

h.  
  In the event of the contractor s noncompliance with the requirements of this clause, actions for noncompliance may be taken in accordance with the rules,
regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to the Act.         

i.  
  The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices in a form to be prescribed by the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance, provided by or through the Contracting Officer. Such notices shall state the rights of applicants and employees as well as the contractor s obligation under the law to take affirmative action to employ
and advance in employment qualified employees and applicants who are disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, other protected veterans, or Armed Forces service medal veterans. The contractor must ensure that applicants or employees who are
disabled veterans are informed of the contents of the notice (e.g., the contractor may have the notice read to a visually disabled individual, or may lower the posted notice so that it might be read by a person in a wheelchair).

j.  
  The contractor will notify each labor organization or representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract understanding,
that the contractor is bound by the terms of the Vietnam Era Veterans  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, and is committed to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified disabled veterans, recently
separated veterans, other protected veterans, and Armed Forces service medal veterans.         

k.  
  The contractor will include the provisions of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order of $100,000 or more, unless exempted by the rules, regulations, or
orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to the Vietnam Era Veterans  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect
to any subcontract or purchase order as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance may direct to enforce such provisions, including action for noncompliance.          Contract Term        The contract base period of performance will be October 1, 2013,
through September 30, 2020, with two, five year renewal periods to be exercised by mutual agreement of the parties. The Night Network will begin operation on September 30, 2013; the Day Network will begin operation on October 1, 2013.

and an officer of the aviation supplier authorized to bind the company.        Assignment     
  Neither Party shall, directly or indirectly (whether by succession, merger, or otherwise) assign, delegate, novate, or otherwise transfer this Contract or
any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written approval of the other. However, the aviation supplier may assign this contract to any of its internal business affiliates upon written notice to the Postal Service.

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          
     Force Majeure        Both the Postal Service and the aviation supplier shall be excused from their obligations for volume guarantees or service performance, respectively, under this Contract, and neither Party shall be liable
to the other or any other person or entity for loss, damage, delay, mis-delivery or non-delivery of shipments transported pursuant to this Contract, resulting in whole or in part from any of the following:   

a.  
  When there occurs a State or Federal government-declared State of Emergency and / or instructions by a government agency that has actual or apparent powers or authority
(including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)) to order airport closures or limitations on airport activity;     

b.  
  When the failure to meet contractual obligations results in whole or in part from public enemies, terrorist acts, criminal acts of any person or entity, public
authorities acting with actual or apparent authority (including U.S. Postal Inspectors), civil commotion, hazards incident to a state of war, national disruptions in transportation networks or operations (of any mode) of the aviation supplier,
Postal Service, or any other entity, strikes, natural disasters, or disruption or failure of third-party communication and information systems; or         

c.  
  When there exist any conditions that present a danger to each Party s personnel.     

d.  
  In every case the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the party claiming that its performance is excused. Each Party is
required to continue and attempt to recommence performance to the greatest extent possible without delay.        It is the
responsibility of the Party asserting the Force Majeure event to formally declare that a Force Majeure event has taken place within twenty-four (24) hours of the event. The party declaring the Force Majeure event must document the circumstances
of the event in writing to the Contracting Officer, who will review the information with the Manager, Air Transportation Operations, and relevant aviation supplier officials. In the absence of a formal request for relief under this clause, all
appropriate volume guarantees and performance standards will remain in force. Except for the calculation of the service levels, nothing in this section shall relieve or excuse the aviation supplier of its service obligations. Subsequent to a Force
Majeure event being declared, the declaring party must provide reasonable, written documentation with sufficient detail to support the declaration.      If, as a result of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events, the aviation supplier is excused from performance, and the Postal Service is excused from meeting its minimum volume commitment for the
identified period, the Parties will meet to agree upon the pro-rata adjustments to be made.      On days where mail volume is withdrawn, withheld,
or not transported under this provision, the minimum volume commitment for the identified period will be reduced for that period by the amount of that volume.        Frequency Adjustment        If, during the term of this contract, the Postal Service
decides to reduce, in whole or in part, the number of delivery days, for any mail type it provides, to fewer than six (6) per week, the Postal Service reserves the right to effectuate a change in delivery days by adjusting the Statement of Work
of this contract, including, but not limited to, the annual number of operating days or the frequency of service hereunder. The parties agree that such an adjustment does not constitute a partial termination of the contract, nor will it give rise to
an equitable adjustment.      If the number of delivery days is reduced, in whole or in part, to five (5) and the Postal Service decides to
reduce the number of operating days under this contract, in whole or in part, to five (5), the parties agree to reduce the Contract Volume Minimum calculation. The Contract Volume Minimum calculation
  
         Page 68 of 100

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          
   
will be reduced by the average daily volume for the previous twelve (12) months excluding the weeks of Peak associated with the removed day of service without adjustment to the tier
structure, the contract rate, or be subject to any other price-related adjustment. The monies associated with the volume removed from the calculation will be eliminated.      If the number of delivery days is reduced to fewer than five (5), and the Postal Service decides to reduce the number of operating days under this contract, in whole or in part, to fewer than five (5),
the parties will negotiate an equitable adjustment if necessary.      No later than 120 days prior to the effective date of such reduction in
delivery days, the parties shall commence discussions as to how to implement the change. Within 90 days of such notice, the supplier must implement the changes outlined above.        Notices        Any notice, report, demand, acknowledgement or other communication which
under the terms of this Contract or otherwise must be given or made by either Party, unless specifically otherwise provided in this Contract, shall be in the English language and in writing, and shall be given or made by express delivery service
with proof of delivery, certified air mail (return receipt requested). The parties may also send a copy of the same communication through electronic mail, facsimile with acknowledgement of receipt/proof of receipt, or personal delivery. If a party
sends a copy of the official correspondence by electronic mail or facsimile, the correspondence shall not be deemed received until the receiving party confirms receipt.      Such notice, report, demand, acknowledgement or other communication shall be deemed to have been given or made in the case of express delivery service with tracking and tracing capability on the date of
signature of the proof of delivery, and in the case of certified mail on the fifth business day in the place of receipt after the date sent.   
  The notice address for the Postal Service shall be:      U.S. Postal Service      Air Transportation CMC   
  Attention: Manager      475 L Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P 650      Washington, DC 20260-0650

    Severability         

a.  
  If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Contract is held by a court or Board of competent jurisdiction or by a request, direction or indication of an
agency or department of a Governmental Body having subject matter jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions shall continue in full force and effect unless the rights and obligations of the parties have been
materially altered or abridged by such invalidation or unenforceability.         

b.  
  If a material provision of this Contract is materially altered or abridged as the result of a final and binding order of a Governmental Body having subject matter
jurisdiction, then the Postal Service and the aviation supplier will meet to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually satisfactory modification to this Contract. If the Parties are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, then either
Party may declare the negotiations to be at an impasse and the parties shall resolve the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this contract.

c.  
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree to make their best efforts to oppose any changes requested by a Governmental Body to any material provision of this
Contract.          Third Party Governmental Delays        If, during the term of this contract, a governmental entity with subject matter jurisdiction enacts laws, promulgates regulations, or issues orders mandating that the aviation supplier screen mail
dispatched for transportation by aircraft within the United States for bombs, explosives, or other hazardous materials, and aviation supplier does not have a method for otherwise complying at no additional cost to the Postal Service, either party
may, at no cost to the other party, suspend performance under the contract during the period in which such screening is actually required to be accomplished.      Within fourteen (14) days of the enactment of any law, promulgation of any regulation, or issuance of any order referenced above, the parties shall commence negotiations in an attempt to modify this
contract to address any adverse impacts and / or other concerns asserted by one or both parties that may arise as a result of additional screening requirements.      If the parties cannot agree upon such a modification within 180 days, or within such longer period as the parties may mutually agree, the contract and all orders hereunder may be terminated at no cost to
either party.        Waiver of Breach        No waiver of breach of any of the provisions of this Contract shall be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provision.

    Attachment 9    
   Wage Determination        October 31, 2012       Due to the size and complexity of this solicitation, it is
impracticable to attach all relevant wage determinations to the solicitation packet. In lieu of a physical attachment, the Postal Service has worked with the Department of Labor to provide instructions to potential contractors for accessing the wage
determination(s) on the Department of Labor website. The instructions are as follows:      Current wage determinations can be found at
www.wdol.gov. This is the official Department of Labor website from which to access wage determinations. To access wage determinations, enter the website and click  Selecting SCA WDs  under the column heading  Service Contract
Act.  Use the drop down menu to select the state and county for the designated wage determination, and then click  Continue.  Answer  No  for the question  Were these services previously performed at this locality under
an SCA-covered contract?  Answer  No  for the question  Are the contract services to be performed listed below as Non-Standard Services?  Click on the Printer Friendly Version for a full view and printable Wage
Determination. Identify the SCA wage determination(s), including determination number, revision date, and state and counties that were used to determine that the rates offered are in compliance  on Attachment 13: Service Contract Act Wage
Determinations .* The revision numbers of the wage determinations listed in the solicitation index of wage determinations should be used in the comparisons. For all the identified SCA eligible labor categories, map the SCA equivalent labor
category title (titles/descriptions available at http://www.wdol.gov. Click on the  library  link, then download the SCA Directory of Occupations, 5th Edition). Also identify the Wage Determination number that the labor categories in your
offer are predicated. Note that the applicable revision number for all Wage Determination numbers is the revision number identified in the solicitation index of wage determinations. In those instances where the aviation supplier has a non-standard
classification (a standard wage does not fit the work category) that requires a special SCA wage determination, the aviation supplier must contact the Postal Service Contracting Officer at:   
  Manager, Air Transportation CMC      475 L  Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P650      Washington, DC 20260-0650   
  Although the aviation supplier assumes sole responsibility to faithfully discharge all duties and obligations with regards to wage determinations imposed
by the Department of Labor, the Postal Service will assist the aviation supplier upon the aviation supplier s request, to the extent necessary, in selecting the appropriate wage determinations.   
  The aviation supplier should review the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations to confirm whether the positions the aviation supplier wishes to
offer fit into the currently published occupation titles under the wage determination. If the position will not fit into any of the currently published occupation titles, please review the instructions in the wage determination entitled  The
process for preparing a conformance request.  In accordance with the Department of Labor instructions (that can be found at www.wdol.gov) in each wage determination, entitled Conformance Process, any class of service employee that is not listed
therein and that is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) must be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e.,
appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are
determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the

performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the
contract.       

*  
  Given the desire of the offerors to seek additional information from the Department of Labor regarding the applicability of the Service Contract Act to the contract(s)
that may result from this solicitation, the completed submission of  Attachment 13: Service Contract Act Wage Determination  may be delayed until a mutually agreeable date prior to contract award. As a condition of acceptance of the
offeror s proposal(s), the offeror must explicitly state that the proposed pricing will hold firm irrespective of any determination made by the Department of Labor.

with a determined number of coverings of loosely woven material for covering the live animal shipments in weather events.      The Postal Service
shall ensure that its Terminal Handling Suppliers follow the procedures established by the aviation supplier for the proper loading and securing of live animal shipments.      For the Day and Night Networks, all bee shipments must be tendered separately from all other shipments. Bee shipments are prohibited on the aviation supplier s Feeder Network.

by the aviation supplier. Live animal shipments will be maintained in an upright position throughout the transportation process to prevent fatality. The Postal Service will not accept or load any shipment that appears to be damaged. The Postal
Service will ensure four (4) inches of air space around the perimeter of stacks of boxes. The  spacers / pallets  used between the stacks of live animals will be provided by the Postal Service.

   The live animals cannot be left in direct sunlight for extended periods. Additionally, the live animals
cannot be left in drafty areas or exposed to exhaust fumes. Live animals cannot be placed near dry ice shipments. If for any particular trunk flight for any origin or destination air stop on the Night Network there is more than 1,000 pounds of dry
ice, any live animal shipments will be rolled to the following Day Network operation. If it is necessary to roll live animal shipments to the following Day Network operation, the aviation supplier will not incur a reduction in payment for the
applicable live animal shipments. On the Day Network, live animal shipments have priority over dry ice. Live animal shipments cannot be covered with any plastic. Cargo or mail cannot be placed on top of live animals.

1.0 Supplier Eligibility    
    
    FedEx views the Postal Service Transportation Agreement   the current contract between FedEx
and the Postal Service   as a strategic alliance providing the Postal Service with cost effective and reliable service while providing FedEx increased asset utilization.     
   Federal Express Corporation (FedEx), a wholly owned subsidiary of FedEx Corporation, submits this proposal in support of the United States Postal Service s (Postal Service) request for proposal (RFP)
number 5A-12-A-0024. This solicitation is for the purchase of air transportation and ancillary services for mail to and from destinations within the contiguous 48 states, and non-contiguous areas, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the
Virgin Islands. We have had the privilege of providing the same services over the past 12 years. As this proposal volume demonstrates, FedEx is fully capable of providing continued reliable service and is committed to continuing our history as a
supportive business partner of the Postal Service going forward. Since 2001, the Postal Service has benefited from the operational efficiencies of our nationwide service in improving its on-time performance record.   
  Our proposal proves that we are the reliable, most cost effective, and dependable business partner for the Postal Service in support of this contract.
FedEx was founded as an airline and operates the world s largest, most capable fleet of cargo aircraft. This fleet amply meets the Postal Service s aviation requirements with reliable and dependable service.   
  As PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) noted and the Postal Service presented in its January 7, 2001  Justification for Noncompetitive Purchase with
Federal Express Corporation  ( Justification ), FedEx  is uniquely  qualified to support the Postal Service as a sole source contractor for air transportation services of U.S. Mail. We remain uniquely qualified to provide
the required Air Cargo Network (ACN) services going forward for the next 7 years.       1.1 14 CFR Part 121 Air Carrier Certification
       Figure 1-1  provides proof that FedEx meets the 14 CFR Part 121 Air Carrier Certification requirements. We are authorized to operate
as an air carrier and conduct common carriage operations in accordance with the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.

1.2 Flight Origins and Destinations (Attachments 2, 3, 4)    
  FedEx will meet the Postal Service s flight origin and destination requirements requested in Attachments 2, 3, and 4 of the RFP to transport mail on
all flights and between all origins and destinations. Our response is included in Attachment 12, Tender and Delivery Time Commitment. As we have consistently shown in our 12 years of outstanding performance, we are fully capable of meeting the
requirements.       1.3 Transport of Live Animals (DMM 601.9.3)       FedEx s policy for transporting live animals is in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) 601.9.3, Live Animals. We have transported more than [ * ] pieces of
live and perishable items over the past 12 months. We have a proven record of successfully handling the challenges of transporting  lives  ranging from baby chicks, to bees, to pandas.   
   1.4 Transport of Hazardous Material (DMM 601.10.0)       FedEx will transport hazardous materials (HAZMAT) for parcels that meet the air transportation requirements established in DMM 601.10.0 and other Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. FedEx has
accepted Postal Service Inaccessible Dangerous Goods (IDG) since October 2006.      Planned dangerous goods shipments from the Postal Service are
IDG shipments only. Current acceptance procedures for all dangerous goods must be followed when receiving dangerous goods (DG) shipments from the Postal Service. All dangerous goods will be inspected by a dangerous goods specialist before the
shipment can be accepted into the FedEx system. Operations will ensure that a dangerous goods specialist is available at the tender locations to inspect and accept dangerous goods tendered by the Postal Service.   

1.5 Transport of Perishables (DMM 601.9.0)       FedEx will transport perishables in accordance with the provisions of DMM 601.9.0. Transporting perishables presents multiple challenges because of the special packaging and handling required. The
packaging, handling, and transport equipment for perishable foods varies considerably, and this complicates loading decisions. The length of time a product will be in transit also affects loading decisions. FedEx will take every precaution to ensure
that all of the transit requirements for the individual commodity are met for maximum shelf life.       1.6 Scanning and Data Exchange
(Attachment 7)        Dispatch and Routing Tags       FedEx certifies that it is capable of scanning Postal Service bar-coded Dispatch   Routing (D R) tags ( Figure 1-2 ) that are Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)-compliant (pursuant to the
guidelines set forth in Attachment 7 of the RFP) to facilitate the exchange of data with the Postal Service. Under the current contract, we scan on average more than [ * ] tags per day.

Figure 1-2. Sample        D R Tag        Bar codes ensure accurate    
   and timely data capture.

EDI Compliance       FedEx will transmit and receive status and operational data according to the EDI standards specified in the solicitation, Attachment 7, Electronic Data Interchange Service Requirements. Additionally, we
will transmit payment information using the Attachment 7 standards for financial data. We will use the standards shown in  Figure 1-3  for transactions of volume and relevant scans with the Postal Service.

     Purpose     

CARDIT   
      
  To convey detailed information about domestic shipments.

  To receive status information at the handling unit level for domestic mail shipments.   
 
   INVOIC ADV   
      
  Message claiming payment for goods and services supplied under agreed upon conditions; serves also as specification for Debit Note and Credit Note messages. Postal Service
implementation is to provide invoice advice to its transport providers of the items, which comprise amounts payable for transportation services.   
 
   CLAIMS   
      
  Message claiming payment for goods and services supplied under agreed-upon conditions; serves also as specification for Debit Note and Credit Note messages. Postal Service
implementation is to provide mechanism for its transport providers to report claims for the mail handling items which comprise amounts payable for transportation services.   
    EDI based on UN/EDIFACT format is technology that is ideal for the high volume of transactions that
will be processed on this contract. FedEx owns the world s largest private digitized network, FedExNet     ,
that allows us to easily accommodate large data streams. We will use FedExNet     , a proprietary private
value-added network (VAN) for business-to-business data exchange. We have successfully used the FedExNet      VAN
for the Postal Service since 2001 to transmit and receive operational and status data, as well as payment data. We are familiar with the Attachment 7 EDI requirements and standards as we have used CARDIT and RESDIT protocols extensively since 2005
for international postal customers.      We will transmit the status and operational data, as well as payment data, over the
VAN, as shown in  Figure 1-4 . Primary files on the FedEx side reside in the Scanning Database which stores and transmits scans and service files (shown as SRS, Summary Reporting System) and the Transportation Agreement Revenue Database which
stores invoice and reconciliation files (shown as REV). With EDI, Postal Service will receive the invoice and reconciliation data from FedEx via a secure mailbox on FedEx Net     .         

Figure 1-4. Postal Service-FedEx EDI Network Highlights    
   FedEx has the experience and infrastructure to fully execute Postal Service accepted EDI standards.    
  FedEx will transmit and receive status and operational data according to the EDI standards as required in the solicitation, Attachment 7, Electronic Data
Interchange Service Requirements. Additionally, we will transmit payment information using the Attachment 7 standards for financial data. Available data will be transmitted at 15-minute intervals in the appropriate EDI format.   
   1.7 Eligibility Status       FedEx is
qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations. FedEx has not been suspended, debarred, or otherwise declared ineligible to receive an award of business. Additionally, we are registered on the System for Award
Management (SAM) as a qualified and eligible Federal Contractor.

2.0 Supplier Capability    
    
    As one of the most reliable, dependable airlines, FedEx has the largest air cargo fleet in the
world, with a record of successfully supporting the Postal Service since 2001. We have ample capabilities and resources to meet or exceed the requirements of this contract.     

FedEx will continue to offer the Postal Service best-in-class mail solutions that include reliable service,
advanced technology, operational strength, and network efficiency. As the world s largest express transportation company, FedEx offers transportation solutions to 100% of the U.S. population. Within the FedEx corporate culture, our main focus
is on each customer s requirements and how we can help improve customer operational efficiencies. Our services and programs help the Postal Service optimize and streamline U.S. domestic transportation processes in the short term and long term
through cooperative continuous improvement projects.      FedEx s highest priority is to focus on our customers. Our founder, Frederick W.
Smith, began FedEx in 1973 with several concepts relatively new to the business world. One of these concepts introduced a corporate culture that embraced and focused   one hundred percent   on the unique needs of each of our customers.
This corporate culture is still embedded in each activity that every FedEx employee performs and for which they are trained. In the same way, innovation, performance, and customer satisfaction are at the forefront of the Postal Service s
objectives. FedEx has also embraced these strategic objectives and has demonstrated an ongoing determination to assist the Postal Service in optimizing and streamlining its network. A few of our industry-recognized awards are highlighted in
 Figure 2-1 . Our record of reliability has earned FedEx the reputation as one of the  World s Most Admired Companies  ( Fortune  magazine). In 2012, FedEx ranked 6th in the  Fortune  list   the 11th consecutive
year that we have been ranked in the top 20 on the list.   

Figure 2-1. FedEx Has Received Many Awards    
   We have consistently won awards across all areas of our company s performance.

FedEx has all the resources required
to more than adequately perform the work required under the Postal Service s ACN solicitation. As the long-time contractor of similar services for the Postal Service, FedEx has the capability to continue operations on the effective date of
award as required by the delivery schedule.      The FedEx outstanding differentiators for the Postal Service are summarized in  Figure 2-2 .
Our superior capabilities are further validated and supported by the certification of our Quality Management System to the International Organization for Standards (ISO) 9001:2008 standard and our recognition as a recipient of the prestigious
Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award   we were the first service organization to win this award  .

Air Cargo Network:  FedEx has the world s largest cargo aircraft fleet to meet the Postal Service s aviation requirements with reliable and dependable
service.  
      
        With more than 634 aircraft, FedEx has the world s largest fleet
of cargo aircraft.         We are the only company with proven experience supporting
requirements of size, scope, and scale of the Postal Service ACN procurement.  
      FedEx is the only aviation supplier with staffed operating bases at all ACN Day Network
airports.         FedEx is the only aviation supplier to the Postal Service that
operates 24/7 with no exclusion for holiday surge and weekend support.         Our ISO
9001:2008 Certification was renewed for 2012.         The FedEx fleet includes more
than 26 trunk and more than 31 feeder spare aircraft that are strategically placed throughout North America to protect service.    

Management:  FedEx possesses the skill, financial depth, and management tools required to engage and deliver on cost, schedule, and performance expectations.  
      
        FedEx uses our Quality Driven Management (QDM) approach. Our methods
are built on the proven premise that higher quality lowers costs, improves service levels, and enhances the customer experience.         Over time, QDM has contributed to FedEx being the 6th most admired company on Fortune s World s Most Admired Companies list and No. 7 on the Reputation Institute s
list of socially responsible firms in the United States.         FedEx s leading
edge technologies (scanning, data transmission, and communications) will deliver superior aviation support to the Postal Service.         FedEx was the first service company to win the Malcolm Baldrige Quality award, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to service quality.    

Past Performance:  FedEx has operated with the Postal Service for 12 years.  
      
        We have successfully met Service Level Requirements for the Postal Service throughout our 12-year service
history, as shown in Figure 1.3.    

Transition:  An award to FedEx ensures the Postal Service a no-risk, no-cost contract transition.  
      
        Our knowledge and understanding of the Postal Service mission, operations, culture, and technology, and
our business partner approach means a non-disruptive, no-risk transition to the ACN contract.    

Innovation and Investment:  FedEx is an innovation leader in air cargo logistics.  
      
        FedEx is ahead of plan to increase the fuel efficiency of our pickup
and delivery fleet by 20% between 2005 and 2020.         In FY12, approximately half
of our $4 billion in capital expenditures is related to modernizing our air fleet.  
      FedEx and the Postal Service invented the Transportation Agreement network design,
significantly improving the performance and reducing the cost of the air transport service, proving that our vendor-customer team excels in innovative practices.    
     2.1 Ability to Meet Required Delivery Schedule    

FedEx will meet the Postal Service delivery schedule with the world s largest cargo aircraft fleet,
more than [ * ] pilots, operating facilities and equipment across the nation, and support staff in place to maintain the services as described in the following sections. FedEx has a proven record of providing superior service to the Postal Service
for the 82 Day Network locations and 146 Night Network locations, carrying volumes at levels ranging from a low of [ * ] cubic feet to a high of [ * ] cubic feet.

FedEx strengthened our competitive advantage by adding larger, more fuel-efficient 777s. We have
already deployed more 777s than any other U.S.-based express cargo carrier.

FedEx is recognized for the ability of our network to adapt to changing Postal Service needs and global
trends. We perform ongoing evaluation of our extensive flight and route schedules at all times of the year to achieve flexibility to meet the needs of the Postal Service and to address the changing needs of the marketplace. The FedEx Postal
Transportation Management Department (PTM) coordinates with FedEx s Air Ground Freight Service (AGFS), which operates the air cargo network, and with our Global Network Planning (GNP) and Global Operations Control Center (GOCC), which plan and
manage flight operations, including the movement of Postal Service cargo. The FedEx aviation network also has extensive redundancy and contingency planning that draws on our aviation resources of jet aircraft, feeder aircraft, 3 U.S. domestic major
sort locations (5 domestic major sort locations for the Night Network), [ * ] FedEx-staffed ramp locations furnished with appropriate cargo handling equipment, and multiple data centers.      FedEx has an in-house Meteorology Department with a current staff of [ * ] whose average experience is more than [ * ] years. This department monitors terminal forecasts for domestic destinations and
alternate airports to support flight operations to meet Postal Service operational needs. The Meteorology Department, created in 1986, has issued guidance on en-route hazardous weather conditions, such as the potential for icing, turbulence, and
other meteorological conditions that may adversely impact daily operations. This accurate, timely data provides an advantage that enables FedEx to anticipate routing changes and make adjustments, thereby avoiding or minimizing impacts on flight
schedules.       2.2 Air Fleet Equipment Description       FedEx has the world s largest cargo air fleet.  Figure 2-3  describes the current FedEx air fleet available to meet the Postal Service requirements as of October 8, 2012.

2.2.1 Age of Air Fleet       The age of our aircraft is shown in  Figure 2-4 . The aircraft we use are proven, highly reliable  work horses.  Our aircraft mechanics are experienced in troubleshooting and routine
maintenance of the aircraft to ensure the safety of our pilots and the mail. Additionally, we have an ongoing fleet modernization plan, provided in Section 2.2.3, outlining the retirement of our oldest aircraft and introduction of newer, more
efficient aircraft. Our modernization plan is aligned with our corporate initiatives under our Sustainability Plan (Section 6.0).       Figure 2-4. Totals of FedEx Air Fleet Models and Average Age of Each Model (as of Oct. 28, 2012)        We depend on our proven aircraft to provide reliable service.        

1.  
  Total is derived by weighting each of the aircraft averages in terms of number of aircraft.     

2.2.2 Fuel Efficiency of Air Fleet         Our fuel efficiency, shown in  Figure 2-5 , will continue to improve as a result of our aircraft modernization plan and strategic utilization of the air transport fleets .    
   2.2.3 Aircraft Modernization Plan       Our
plan to replace our older aircraft in the current fleet with 20% more fuel-efficient and green airplanes by 2020 is ahead of schedule. After only 6 years of a 15-year plan, we have completed 69% of our goal to reduce aircraft emissions intensity by
20% by 2020. Because we are ahead of the schedule, we have raised the standards so that our goal is to now reduce aircraft emissions intensity by 30% by 2020. Because we are committed to reducing aircraft emissions and increasing fuel efficiency, we
invested $4 billion in capital expenditures, about half related to modernizing the air fleet during FY 12.

United States Postal Service       Air Cargo Network       Volume 1       November 6, 2012    

Our strategy to      compete collectively, operate independently, manage
collaboratively      provides flexibility in sizing our operating companies to align with varying macro-economic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change.
We use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the domestic and global economy. For example, in May 2012, we decided to retire from service 24 aircraft and related engines. The decision to retire these aircraft will better align our
U.S. domestic air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. FedEx is also shortening the depreciable lives of additional aircraft and related engines to accelerate the retirement of selected aircraft models.   
   Figure 2-6  presents our projections of each aircraft type at the end of our fiscal year over the next 7 years. We have agreed to purchase 46 new
B767F aircraft, with the first three arriving in FY 14. The B767Fs were selected to reduce fuel and maintenance costs, as we continue to improve the efficiency and technology of our aircraft fleet.   
  [ * ]       Figure 2-6.
FedEx Aircraft Modernization Schedule       FedEx has an aggressive schedule to upgrade our aircraft fleet for improved reliability, faster
transit time, reduced maintenance, and better fuel performance.       
     2.3 Ground Handling and Sorting Operations       Our ground handling and sorting operations are fully capable of meeting the requirements of this solicitation. FedEx can process mail for movement via aircraft, tug and dolly, containerized trucks, and
bulk trucks from our facility to the Postal Service facility. This includes Priority Mail (PML), Express Mail (EML), First Class Mail (FCM), and Registered Mail (RML). Our team members will take great care in handling all packages that enter our
sorting system, to be sure that they are scanned and then secured in the appropriate containers, trailers, or aircraft. In  Figure 2-7 , we present the highlights of these operations, and additional details are provided in Volume 2 of this
proposal.

Figure 2-7. FedEx Air Transport Mail Delivery Service Process    
   FedEx has developed a series of mature processes to move air cargo from origin to destination, meeting    
   the contractual tender times.       FedEx leads the industry in scanning and tracking technology. Packages typically are scanned during our pickup, sort, and delivery processes by trained handlers and by automated overhead scanners and
scanning systems. Scanning enables FedEx and the Postal Service to track the movement of packages from pickup to delivery for an added level of security. Using a variety of wireless data collection devices, we scan package bar codes at each hand-off
point, capturing a variety of shipment information:       

Dispatch and routing number  
        Origin/destination location
information   
     
      Ship date  
        Exception scans   
     
      Type of service  
        Proof of
delivery.    
     2.4 Integrity and Business Ethics Record       FedEx has a longstanding commitment to compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever we operate, striving to maintain a high standard of business and personal ethics. Every FedEx employee,
officer, and director is required to comply with the policies set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. FedEx contractors and global service participants performing services on behalf of FedEx or operating under the FedEx brand name also
comply with those portions of the code that apply to them. Our officers, directors, and managers have the additional responsibility of promoting the principles set forth in this code and fostering a culture in which ethical conduct is recognized,
valued, and exhibited by all team members. Our commitment to doing the right thing depends on the ability to set the proper tone and to address suspected violations promptly with care and respect. All senior managers and all members of management
above senior manager have to annually recertify under our Code of Business Conduct Questionnaire.      We also have an independent Board of
Directors committed to the highest quality of corporate governance. During the past few years, we have added a number of highly qualified, independent directors to the Board, including  R. Brad Martin , the former CEO of Saks Incorporated, and
 Joshua Cooper Ramo , Vice Chairman of Kissinger Associates, Inc. The Board has taken significant steps to enhance its accountability to stockholders in recent years. For example, in 2012, stockholders approved our proposal to amend the FedEx
certificate of incorporation to allow holders of 20 percent or more of FedEx common stock the right to call special meetings of stockholders. The Board also recently adopted a  lead independent director  governance structure.   
  Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, in light of best practices, and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code, which apply to all of our
directors, officers, and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available in the Corporate Governance section of the Investor Relations page of our website at  investors.fedex.com . We post any
amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code to the extent that such disclosure is required, on our website in the corporate governance section of the Investor Relations page.

2.5.2 Experience       In 2000 the Postal Service approached FedEx to help design a solution to the problems in its Transportation Network. Rising cost and unacceptable service levels were impairing the growth of Priority and
Express Mail. Over the following year, FedEx and the Postal Service jointly designed and developed a Shared Network system. The system was implemented in August 2001 and was projected to save the Postal Service in excess of [ * ] dollars over the [
* ] and drastically improve service. The network increased the number of locations served on both Day and Night Networks. [ * ].

2.5.3 Accounting and Operational
Controls       FedEx has developed a proprietary system for tracking volume and invoicing specifically for the Postal Service. FedEx also has an
online communication system for reporting operational updates and status, providing accurate and timely data. Additional information for operational controls can be found in Section 3.0 of this volume. During the course of our current Postal
Service Transportation Agreement Contract, we have never had an accounting irregularity.      As a publicly traded corporation, FedEx s
internal controls over financial reporting are audited annually by Ernst   Young to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and accounting standards. Our latest audit was completed on May 31, 2012. FedEx s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The results of the annual audit can be found in our 2012 Annual Report; no
exceptions were noted. PTM has also gone through several internal audits and has received an Exceptional rating from our Internal Audit Department.       2.5.4 Technical Skills       FedEx employs staff with varying skills and qualifications from IT
analysts, to industrial and mechanical engineers, to on-site maintenance mechanics, to package handlers. Each of our ramp and hub locations operates as a  mini-hub  in that it has all the required IT infrastructure and staff to run the
facility, which requires a vast number of skills. The following are a few areas of expertise necessary for successful execution of this contract:       

Pilots.  We have more than [ * ] pilots, each with a minimum of [ * ] hours total fixed-wing time as pilot-in-command (PIC). All of our pilots
possess the Commercial Pilot Certificate and Multi-Engine and Instrument ratings as required by the FAA. Many are also retired military pilots with honorable discharge from their respective military branches. FedEx pilots are required to possess
knowledge of theory of flight, air navigation, meteorology, flying directives, and aircraft operating procedures.          

Aircraft Mechanics.  More than [ * ] mechanics who maintain the Boeing, Airbus, and McDonnell Douglas aircraft fleets. Their duties include
performing standard safety checks, reviewing the aircraft s maintenance logbook for any planned maintenance to be done that day, and performing engine repair.      

Package Handlers.  More than [ * ] handlers and support staff in AGFS who sort, load, and unload aircraft containers in a safe and efficient
manner. FedEx handlers must work under stringent time schedules, process potentially high volume of mail, and properly load and unload containers.          

IT Analysts.  More than [ * ] IT professionals who operate one of the world s largest computer and telecommunications networks. The network
includes more than [ * ] networked computers and tens of thousands of hand-held computers that record shipments. Our data center processes more than [ * ] information management system transactions daily. Our IT analysts hold industry-recognized
certifications, including Microsoft Certified IT Professional (MCITP), Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE), Project Management Institute s Project Management Professional (PMP), and Certified Information Systems Security Professional

3.0 Management Plan    
    
    FedEx will successfully manage the ACN contract by leveraging its knowledge and understanding of the
Postal Service s mission, operations, culture, and technology requirements.     
   FedEx recognizes that to be successful we must
have a management plan that addresses normal daily operations and is capable of handling unscheduled and unexpected events. Updates to this plan will be provided to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of any changes made by the Vice President of
PTM. At least annually, FedEx will review and verify for the Postal Service that it has a current management plan. In addition to the day-to-day key personnel, FedEx has and will train all employees to a level of knowledge and familiarity to ensure
that normal operations and all contingency plans will be exercised without delay to address the unexpected or unscheduled events in accordance with the training plan.       3.1 Daily Operations Management Plan       FedEx is one of the 5 largest airlines in the world
and it is one of the most reliable. This means that we have the resources to meet all Postal Service aviation requirements. We have the people, processes, and tools to meet all the management requirements of this solicitation. Volume 2 of this
response discusses the contingency plans in place to meet any issues.       3.1.1 Late Arriving Aircraft and Trucks (Originating and
Destinating)        Ability to Conduct Two Operations   Originating and Destinating    
  In the event of late arriving aircraft and trucks, FedEx will have the ability to perform origin and destination services simultaneously, if necessary.
FedEx conducts and will continue, 2 daily operations, the day (Tuesday Saturday) and the night (Monday Friday). The day service is primarily for deferred services, Priority Mail, and First Class Mail. The night service is primarily for
expedited services and Express Mail. Since FedEx has the largest overnight network in the world, we have available capacity that can be utilized for the movement of Postal Service shipments as necessary during the day, and we have the ability to
alter the movement and distribution of services within our multi-hub network. We build redundancy into our operations to provide maximum flexibility. FedEx has the manpower and equipment at our ramps and hubs to recover late arriving aircraft and
trucks. We can also divert aircraft to alternate hub locations, if that contingency proves necessary.       3.1.2 Early Arriving Aircraft and
Trucks       For any aircraft or truck that arrives early, FedEx will offload, stage, and secure the freight, and then notify the Terminal
Handling Service (THS). We will manage the entire network to operate on time.       3.1.3 Mail Arriving Out of Normal Sequence    
  For mail arriving out of sequence, we will make adjustments to accommodate it. This involves alerting the Postal Service of abnormal or delayed arrivals.
FedEx can adjust work schedules according to operational requirements to maximize service to our customers.       3.1.4 Trucks Not On-Site for
Dispatch       FedEx Express operates approximately 52,400 ground transport vehicles including pickup and delivery vans, larger trucks called
container transport vehicles, and over-the-road tractors and trailers. These vehicles are strategically located at service points across the network to support volumes and service delivery requirements and are repositioned to meet mail service
delivery schedules.

3.1.5 Inclement Weather During Operations
    
   FedEx has a superior record in meeting delivery schedules during inclement weather. To proactively address
disruptions caused by weather, FedEx employs on-staff meteorologists whose function is to monitor weather conditions. The FedEx Meteorology Department has been an in-house function since 1986 with a current staff of [ * ] whose average experience is
more than [ * ] years. Our staff has been certified and approved by the FAA to use the Enhanced Weather Information Systems (EWINS) as the primary source of forecasts in support of trunk aircraft operations worldwide. The staff s experiences
range from various military branches, the National Weather Service, and the private sector to provide a well-rounded understanding of all types of weather disruptions that could impact the FedEx operating system.

FedEx Meteorology supports flight
operations, primarily by issuing and monitoring terminal forecasts for domestic destinations, alternate airports, and key international locations. Meteorologists also provide guidance on en-route hazardous weather conditions such as the potential
for icing, turbulence, and other meteorological conditions, which may adversely impact daily operations. Personnel also provide weather support and briefings to FedEx senior management in support of contingency operations worldwide including
hurricanes and typhoons, winter weather events, the spread of hazardous volcanic ash, widespread flooding that affects ground operations and FedEx locations or assets, and solar weather events that could be harmful to crews flying long-haul routes
at high latitudes. Additional information is provided in Volume 2, Section 2.2.1.       3.1.6 Protection of Mail During Inclement Weather
      FedEx protects each shipment from the weather by using containers to transport small packages to the hubs and during loading and unloading
of the aircraft. Plastic covers are used on the skidded freight to protect packages against weather damage. FedEx also uses plastic covers for containers as needed in inclement weather.      FedEx believes preparation is the key to success in irregular operations. Our Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) preparation is well known and respected in the BCDR community. FedEx is a
member of the Supply Chain Risk Leadership Counsel and is an integral part of many local, state, and Federal BCDR planning groups around the United States. We lend our expertise in disaster preparation and contingency execution to many of our
customers and suppliers to assist them in designing the best business resiliency plans possible.       3.1.7 Labor Actions    
  [ * ]       3.1.8 Inadequate Staffing
      FedEx will meet surge demands of all of our customers including the Postal Service, particularly during peak periods or periods of
inclement weather, natural disasters, or when customers demand increases. We have a reserve pool of employees who are on standby to cover all positions. We have more than [ * ] pilots which allows us to meet Peak Week and holiday requirements.

United States Postal Service       Air Cargo Network       Volume 1       November 6, 2012    

FedEx has designed a functional organization to matrix across all areas. FedEx will move employees from
one location to another as needed to supplement existing staffing loads or requirements within a facility as we have done for the Postal Service over the life of the current contract. Our cross-training programs allow us this flexibility, as one
employee can assume the responsibilities of another. The flexibility of our non-union workforce allows FedEx to move employees between functions as the workload demands it.       3.1.9 Inability to Complete All Loading       The FedEx monthly operating plan provides staffing
to meet all tender requirements. We will call staff from other shifts and locations to meet all Postal Service loading requirements as necessary. We also maintain reserve equipment for deployment as needed for contingencies. We have always been able
to complete all loading for the Postal Service.       3.1.10 Overflow Mail       FedEx has provided the Postal Service with 5% flex under the existing agreement and will continue to do so in our proposed operating plan for the day network and 20% flex for the night network. Volume
above these levels is moved on a space-available basis. At the FedEx hub, we will provide adequate lift and will ensure all alternate movements are coordinated between the Postal Service and PTM. FedEx provides priority boarding for all postal
products ahead of all FedEx domestic, non-specialty products.       3.1.11 Less Mail Transportation Equipment (MTE) Than Required
      Since FedEx is not bidding the Terminal Handling Service function, we will depend upon the Postal Service to provide the THS. FedEx will
contact the Postal Service for additional MTEs and will loose-load or palletize as required by the Postal Service s operation plan.   
   3.1.12 Damaged/Non Airworthy Containers    
  FedEx has well-documented procedures for assessing damage and determining the airworthiness of containers (e.g., unit load device, ULD) in our system.
ULDs are subject to primary and secondary inspections according to FedEx operating procedures. We use an  Airworthy ULD Inspection Checklist  that has been developed to provide all personnel working with ULDs a set of criteria for
determining whether a ULD is airworthy. FedEx will provide these procedures and training support to the THS to minimize the loading of non-airworthy containers.      If a damaged ULD is found before the container is loaded, FedEx will provide a replacement container. If the damaged ULD is found after the container is loaded, FedEx will trans-load shipments to another
airworthy container. FedEx also retains a staging lot of ULD reserves at our major sort and ramp locations for use during volume surges within our network (i.e., peak season).       3.1.13 Damaged Surface Containers       If a FedEx surface container is damaged, FedEx will
provide a replacement or notify the Postal Service or the THS provider. We routinely have reserve ULDs that we can access as a contingency. FedEx routinely provides emergency use of our equipment when the THS provider has experienced an equipment
failure and cannot recover in time. This occurs multiple times per year and FedEx has been able to provide the necessary equipment without disruption.       3.1.14 Damaged or Non-Labeled Mail       If a package is damaged, it will be repackaged
according to Postal Service guidelines. When a package is not labeled or the label is damaged, the Postal Service declares a contingency for unassigned mail. This process is followed for any amount of unlabeled mail tendered by the Postal Service to
FedEx (even one piece). These procedures are followed to ensure that the mail volume is directed to the proper labeling operation and does not interfere with normal sort operations.

The Postal Service will contact FedEx ramp personnel to declare a mail contingency      

The Postal Service will separate labeled from unlabeled mail in the tender process      

FedEx will designate, on flight reports, which position(s) have unlabeled mail in the remarks for each container      

The ULDs containing unlabeled mail will be taken to the exception area and labeled via SAMS      
  Re-labeling is an example of our commitment to the Postal Service. In August 2002, the Postal Service approached FedEx requesting that we take over the
re-labeling function at the Memphis hub. Since FedEx has assumed responsibility for relabeling, most if not all pieces move out the same day that they arrive in the sort. FedEx re-labels approximately [ * ] pieces per day on a non-contingency day.
Approximately [ * ] times per month the Postal Service will declare a contingency (e.g., if its SAMS equipment is down in the local market) and the unlabeled handling units are sent to the Memphis hub where FedEx labels the mail. In these
situations, we label between [ * ] and [ * ] handling units of mail and reintroduce them back to the network, thereby allowing the Postal Service to meet mail delivery service for their customers.   
   3.1.15 Plan and Schedule Changes       Plan
changes are coordinated through PTM following the planning schedule, which is defined in the Network Operating Plan sections of Volume 2. In addition, FedEx works with the Postal Service to accommodate last minute modifications to the volume
requests. Tactical schedule deviations for volume, maintenance, weather-related, or other disruptions to service are handled through the FedEx Global Operations Control Center (GOCC). Please see the Contingency Plan section in Volume 2 for more
information.       3.1.16 Loose Load Mail       FedEx handles loose-loaded mail daily per the planning template to meet the local requirements for each Postal Service market. FedEx also accepts loose-loaded trailers.   
   3.1.17 HAZMAT   Acceptable and Non-acceptable Pieces    

FedEx currently accepts HAZMAT in accordance with the DMM 601.10.0 procedures. Details of the FedEx
procedures can be found in Volume 2, Section 1.12.4. We have been handling HAZMAT materials since 2006 and work well with the Postal Service in handling a volume of more than [ * ] shipments per year. We also work with the Department of
Transportation s and the International Air Transport Association s rules and regulations on handling HAZMAT pieces. We have routinely been handling acceptable pieces and have procedures in place to handle any non-acceptable pieces with the
Postal Service.

3.1.18 Handling and Staging of Live Animals    

FedEx has transported live animal shipments through the air and truck network for the Postal Service since
October 2006. As one example of how live animals are handled through the air network, we developed operating policy R2-55-15-2   Postal Service Mail Live Animal Handling and exception Procedures   for our aircraft ramp operations. This
document establishes the practices currently used by the Postal Service and is the result of our collaboration with the Postal Service. It is available upon request. As shown in  Figure 3-1 , we are equipped to transport a wide variety of
animals from pandas to newly hatched chicks and even bees.       

3.1.19   
   Assisting Aviation Supplier in Container Positioning         FedEx will assist the Postal Service or THS provider in on-loading and off-loading containers to and from dollies and trucks.   

3.1.20   
   Assisting Aviation Supplier in Maintaining Open Lines of Communication         FedEx will maintain open communication with the Postal Service, the THS providers, and other aviation suppliers. Depending on the operations, we will have continual, on-going operational dialogues at the
quarterly performance management meetings. We are receptive to additional suggestions to improve our communications. We are committed to continuously improving communications between the Postal Service and FedEx and have demonstrated that commitment
in the past.

   Transporting Lives        FedEx is accustomed to transporting        live animals.

3.1.21 Supplies Maintenance
      FedEx maintains a reserve of supplies; however, if a shortage occurs, FedEx will procure any necessary supplies such as equipment,
maintenance, and material; building maintenance, construction, and repair; repair of machinery; aircraft parts; janitorial services; security guard services; ground transportation; water treatment; and any other services that may be required. FedEx
will abide by its subcontracting plan in procuring these services (Section 7).       3.1.22 Power Losses

Importance Other Factors Impacting FedEx       [ * ]       3.2 Key Personnel       The FedEx PTM organization has been in place since the inception of the
program. As depicted in  Figure 2-8 ,  Paul Herron  and  Ron Stevens  will serve as key personnel for this contract and have been managing our Postal Service contracts since 2001. They routinely communicate with Postal Service
stakeholders on all matters pertaining to conformance with contract requirements in order to meet our service delivery performance goals.   
   Paul Herron, Vice President, Postal Transportation Management       Paul was part of the original FedEx team that, along with the Postal Service, developed the Shared Network Transportation Agreement. He has led the FedEx Postal department since its inception and is
responsible for all FedEx Postal alliances. In this role he interfaces with senior postal executives and has presented to the Board of Governors on a number of occasions. Paul is a 24-year FedEx employee with experience in strategic planning,
finance, system form, air operations, and customer engineering. Paul holds an MBA from the University of Tennessee.       Ron D. Stevens,
Managing Director, Postal Transportation Management       Ron was responsible for establishing the PTM in 2001. Ron was a member of the
negotiating team for the original contract, the current contract negotiated in 2006, five addenda since 2001, and the Drop Box program renewal in 2006. Ron was responsible for the rollout of Global Express Guaranteed (GXG) (our co-branded
international product with the Postal Service) which included developing a process to address all service and billing issues related to GXG.   
  Ron has 26 years of experience with FedEx and has worked in operations and engineering. Ron earned a B.A. Degree in business administration from Columbia
State University. Ron has served as a member of the IATA Airmail Panel since 2007 representing FedEx on issues related to the movement of international mail.      FedEx believes that our ongoing operational partnership with the U.S. Postal Service brings significant advantages to a renewal contract for the Air Cargo Network. These FedEx key personnel demonstrate
their dedication to both FedEx and the Postal Service through their long-term involvement and continued commitment to supporting the Postal Service.       3.3 Training of Personnel       As we state in Volume 2 of this response, contingency situations
such as challenges from blizzards to hurricanes are a way of life for FedEx employees. At any given moment, our staff has to be prepared to respond to contingencies, implement proven plans, and continue service delivery to our customers. Our
employees, from the GOCC contingency planners and managers to the PTM management team to the ramp staff at each FedEx airport location, are trained in dealing with events and circumstances outside of their control. Besides initial and annual
recurring training on the contingency plan and specific planning and response actions of each FedEx airport location, employees also receive additional training when the contingency plan is revised or local procedures are updated. Training is
required for all employees ranging from aircraft pilots, mechanics, general support, IT, environmental health and safety, and logistical staff.   
  Training records are maintained in employee personnel records and include training received, test scores, and certifications. For example, training for
handlers includes safety, dangerous goods, proper T-stacking methods/container loading, ULD inspection, re-wrap of damaged packages, and container close-out slips.       3.4 Updates to Management Plan       The Vice President of PTM will submit any changes to this
plan to the Postal Service Contracting Officer within 10 calendar days. Any changes which impact delivery will be made as well. We will also review any major changes to this plan that are impacted by the Contingency Plan in Volume 2. FedEx will
update the management plan as required and incorporate any appropriate changes into our training program that will be sent to our key personnel. At least annually, we will review and verify with the Postal Service to keep our management plan
current.

4.0 Past Performance    
    
    FedEx is the only company that can show past performance examples demonstrating our proven capabilities to support a
contract of this size, scope, and complexity.     

FedEx has the largest air cargo fleet and a long history of past performance with the Postal Service. We
reach all points and will meet tender and delivery times contained in Attachment 12. This history is steeped in many collaboration efforts to meet the Postal Service mission that can be found in Section 101(a) of Title 39 of the U.S. Code, also
known as the Postal Reorganization Act, which states:         The Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation to
provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people. It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal
services to all communities.      

It is through an understanding of
this mission that FedEx has worked tirelessly in collaboration with the Postal Service to meet all delivery requirements. No other cargo air carrier has the benefit of this long and efficient operational experience with the Postal Service, where
schedules and tender times were optimized and excessive costs were eliminated from the program. We currently hold two Postal Service contracts: the FedEx Postal Service Transportation Agreement and the Global Express Guaranteed Agreement.
Summaries of these contracts are found in Section 4.4 of this volume.   

FedEx services Fortune 500 companies and worldwide industry leaders with high-volume shipping and delivery
requirements. However, our Postal Service Agreement contracts dwarf all other customers  requirements due to the extremely high volume of mail. We provide transportation solutions to the world s top companies in more than 220 countries and
territories. We also hold several Department of Defense (DoD) contracts for similar mail transport through both air and ground methods. For most of our commercial clients, we hold confidentiality agreements to protect the sensitive nature of our
business relationships, so we are not able to disclose their names and the details of their products or services. Our customers consider the use of FedEx services to be a competitive advantage and have not granted legal permission to disclose
details about our relationship; however, a summary of our past performance on non-Postal Service clients is shown in Section 4.5 of this volume.  Figure 4-1  provides a snapshot of our project summaries for evaluation.

     4.1 Record of Conformance to Contract Requirements       FedEx has met all contractual requirements for meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs), delivery, schedule, reporting, and communication on all of our contracts for both Postal Service and non-Postal
customers. FedEx was the Postal Service s largest supplier for FY 11, as it has been for 9 straight years. FedEx has not been suspended, debarred, or otherwise declared ineligible to perform on any Federal contract.   
   4.2 Record of FedEx On-Time Performance    
  FedEx has, and will continue to meet and exceed our delivery times for Postal Service and non-Postal customers. We are able to accomplish this through the
size of our fleet, but also through technological advances in logistics management and well developed contingency plans that are detailed in Volume 2 of this proposal.      Each of our Postal Service and non-Postal clients has unique performance requirements. While one client may have a requirement for delivery within 3 days of tender, others require delivery by 10:30 the
following morning. The differences between delivery commitments make it impossible to directly compare service performance between customers. The Postal Service is the only customer for whom delivery expectation is on the same day as tender for its
deferred product. When possible, we have included our on-time delivery performance for these contracts in our summaries in Section 4.5.   
   Figure 4-2  and  Figure 4-3  show our on-time performance rates for the current Transportation Agreement and the Global Express Guaranteed
(GXG) Agreement.      [ * ]       4.3
Established Productive Business Relations       One of the key success factors in any business relationship is communication. With all of our
customers, we have set up a range of processes to ensure the most effective communication, reporting, and exchange of operational, financial, performance, and administrative information. For our Postal Service contracts, FedEx communicates daily via
electronic reports, face-to-face meetings, and with Postal Service on-site personnel. FedEx uses EDI 214, Version 4010, for the electronic transmission of information.

United States Postal Service       Air Cargo Network       Volume 1       November 6, 2012    

We are continually evaluating and improving our processes and service offerings to meet client needs. FedEx
is a leading innovator in the overnight delivery business because we reward and motivate our team members to deliver on time. We also encourage and implement recommendations from our clients on how to improve our service delivery through routine
collection of customer satisfaction data.   

Since our founding in 1973, we have
operated with a goal of 100% customer satisfaction. Due to our rigorous continuous process improvement program, we are constantly assessing the root cause and reason when we miss this delivery performance metric. That is why we created the Hierarchy
of Horrors and the Service Quality Index (SQI). This is a system of weighted performance indicators that measure the functions of critical importance to the customer based on the degree of customer aggravation.  Figure 4-4  shows the item
description and its associated weight. The total number of  average daily failure points  is multiplied by that component s weight to calculate the SQI.       4.3.1 Cooperation and Commitment to Customer Satisfaction       [ * ]   

4.3.2 Governance and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics    
  FedEx operates under the tenets of our mission statement, which focuses on our customer service:

FedEx Corporation will produce
superior financial returns for its shareowners by providing high value-added logistics, transportation and related information services through focused operating companies. Customer requirements will be met in the highest quality manner appropriate
to each market segment served. FedEx Corporation will strive to develop mutually rewarding relationships with its employees, partners and suppliers. Safety will be the first consideration in all operations. Corporate activities will be conducted to
the highest ethical and professional standards.        Our Board of Directors oversees our corporate governance to ensure our policies and
practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, in light of best practices, and makes whatever changes are necessary to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate
governance. FedEx policies, manuals, and handbooks are important components of our overall compliance and ethics program, and they work in conjunction with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. If an employee has reason to believe that a legal or
ethical violation has occurred, it is his or her duty to report it, and our policies forbid any form of retaliation. Our commitment to doing the right thing depends on our ability to set the proper tone and to address suspected violations promptly
with care and respect.      The unique FedEx operating strategy works seamlessly   and simultaneously   on three levels:   

Operate independently  by focusing on our independent networks to meet distinct customer needs.      

Compete collectively  by standing as one brand worldwide and speaking with one voice.      

Manage collaboratively  by working together to sustain loyal relationships with our workforce, customers, and investors.

5.0 Security Plan    
    
    Through FedEx s extensive human-intelligence network, we are keenly qualified not only to
recognize, but to be proactive in addressing potentially dangerous activity.     
   FedEx has a very robust security organization that
takes every reasonable precaution to protect the mail. This security starts when we take possession of the mail and ends when the mail is tendered to the Postal Service or THS. Our security organization (Section 5.1) helps to ensure the security of
physical mail, information, and persons. Upon contract award, FedEx will work with the Postal Service to review and approve the security plan for implementation across the FedEx Regions as required by the contract. This plan, in compliance with
Provision 4-10 of the RFP, will replace our current security plan from Section F of our Postal Contract Number 07-0454, which addresses all current points in addition to security training procedures for employees (Section 5.6).   

This security plan will include a statement of principles that will be used by the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service ( Inspection Service ) and FedEx to address U.S. Mail investigations and security matters related to this contract ( the Agreement ) between FedEx and the Postal Service. The statement of principles is not intended to be
all-inclusive, but is designed to provide a broad framework that will allow flexibility for the parties to accomplish their respective security and investigative missions. In no event will the statement of principles be construed as an expansion of
FedEx s obligations or the Inspection Service s authority under any applicable law or regulation, or expand either party s rights or obligations under the Agreement. For purposes of the statement of principles, the term
 mail  shall mean any item that is tendered to the aviation supplier by the Postal Service for transportation. The statement of principles is based on open communication and cooperation between the parties at each organizational level, to
the fullest extent possible in postal-related matters.   

5.1 Establish Coordination
      FedEx Vice President of Security US, D. [ * ], is responsible for all Postal Service security matters under the cognizance of our team,
which includes maintaining and updating this plan as required and meeting Postal Service security and contractual requirements or changes per Attachment J of the RFP. [ * ] will work directly with FedEx Regional Directors and the Postal Service
Inspection Service, Deputy Chief Inspector, Headquarters  Operation, Kenneth W. Newman to address all policy issues and any investigative or operational issues not resolved at the local level.   
  FedEx Regional Directors are familiar with Postal Service security requirements and procedures. They will be responsible for the implementation,
monitoring, reporting, and training the security staff on Postal Service specific security requirements.  Figure 5-1  shows FedEx-designated Regional Directors who are currently performing, and will continue to perform security management.
     [ * ] will work directly with [ * ], FedEx Managing Director of PTM, on all security matters related to this contract. Security s flat
organization and direct approach establishes clear lines of communication, with minimal bureaucracy in coordinating and managing security actions.      FedEx Customer Security Services (CSS) is responsible for security at FedEx. CSS provides comprehensive, strategic security programs that are based on proactive analysis of potential threats, innovative
technology solutions, and aggressive investigations. CSS develops and implements coordinated contingency plans throughout FedEx that are focused on universal consequence management for catastrophic events.

5.2 Implementation, Administration, and Maintenance Activities    
  The FedEx security plan combines our stringent corporate policies with the Postal Service security policies to ensure the highest levels of security for
all mail transported under this contract. Our security plan ( Figure 5-2 ) encompasses the right people, processes, and tools to accomplish the required security activities.   

5.2.1 Communication       FedEx Security will notify the appropriate Inspection Service division of any known theft, vandalism, or criminal activity involving the mail while in the custody of FedEx, by written notification. The
Inspection Service division will notify the appropriate FedEx Security Director of any criminal activity or security issues related to FedEx or Postal Service customers and employees occurring on Postal Service owned or leased property. Both parties
will cooperate and assist, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and on a commercially reasonable basis, with relevant security and investigative information related to the transportation and handling of the mail on Postal Service owned or
leased property.      The security of the U.S. Mails is discussed in Volume 2, Section 1.3.18 of our proposal.

Figure 5-1. Security Process, Procedures, and Policies    
   FedEx security plan complies with Postal Service requirements.

5.2.2 Investigations
      FedEx Security will notify the Inspection Service of all investigative and security issues involving the mail in the custody of FedEx by
written notification. The Inspection Service is responsible for conducting all criminal investigations of the mail while in the FedEx system and for criminal activities directed at FedEx customers, or employees on Postal Service owned or leased
property. The dedicated resources referenced in the coordination elements of this Agreement will be responsible for ensuring timely notification of, and cooperation with the Inspection Service for all matters related to investigations and other
requirements of the Postal Service Inspection Service.       5.2.3 Criminal and Administrative Proceedings    
  FedEx Security (subject to the receipt of a properly issued subpoena or other similar  compulsions to appear ) and Inspection Service personnel
will serve as witnesses in criminal and administrative proceedings that result from these investigations. We will comply with all Federal, state, and local authorities.

5.2.4 Access to FedEx Operations, Facilities, Personnel and Loss Data    
  Subject to Noninterference (Section 5.2.10), FedEx Security will provide the Inspection Service access to our facilities, operations, and records when
necessary for investigations involving the mail. We understand that the Inspection Service will provide reasonable advance notice to FedEx Express for access for its investigative or security purposes.   

FedEx Security will coordinate interviews of its employees with the Inspection Service relevant to their
investigations involving the mail, as required. FedEx Security will be present at any non-custodial or witness interviews of any FedEx employee conducted by Postal Inspectors, but not at custodial interviews.   
  Investigative reports prepared by FedEx Express Security may be provided to the Inspection Service in response to a validly issued subpoena after the
FedEx investigation has been completed. FedEx management will make independent determinations about the discipline or discharge of any FedEx employee. The Inspection Service will not attempt to dictate, direct, or carry out such actions.

5.2.5 Surveillance Operations
      FedEx Security will provide access to, and the information obtained from our close circuit television (CCTV) systems for investigation
purposes. We will assist the Inspection Service with the installation of temporary CCTVs for investigations in compliance with Federal and state laws governing video surveillance investigations and reasonable expectations of privacy in the
workplace.       5.2.6 Undercover Operations       FedEx Security may, subject to Section 5.2.10, Noninterference, authorize the placement of Inspection Service undercover personnel in its facilities where deemed necessary for investigations
involving the mail. The Postal Service will defend and indemnify FedEx for any loss, damage, or other liability arising from the use of undercover personnel in FedEx facilities.       5.2.7 Contingency Planning and Notification       FedEx Security will ensure that the
Inspection Service is listed as a party to be notified in its critical incident or contingency plans related to the loss, destruction, or delay of the mail caused by catastrophic losses of an aircraft or other vehicle transporting the mail, or a
FedEx facility. FedEx Security will cooperate with the Inspection Service in the recovery of the mail where necessary.       5.2.8 Overgoods

by third parties for records maintained in this system will be processed in accordance with requirements of the Privacy Act. All public disclosures of investigations information, including media
requests or press releases, will be coordinated between the Inspection Service and FedEx Media Relations in accordance with a mutually agreed communications plan.       5.2.10 Noninterference       It is our understanding that the Inspection Service agrees that in
the exercise of its rights under this protocol it will not disrupt or interfere with FedEx operations.       5.2.11 Modifications
      FedEx will review this plan annually and will make modifications based on the mutual agreement of FedEx and the Inspection Service.
      5.3 Conformance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Local Airport Authority
      FedEx complies with all security requirements for personnel, facilities, and program security as stated in the RFP. We are cognizant of
the FAA, TSA, and local airport authority rules and will continually work with these organizations to ensure compliance with the regulations. Our security plan follows the vision of TSA s Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement Air
Cargo Division for a layered solution designed to protect against security breaches, by using a combination of process along with information and technology-based solutions, while preserving the integrity of the mail supply chain against threats to
air cargo security.      FedEx will continue to meet with FAA and TSA on security matters that affect our aircraft when not at the airport. In
March 2011, we met with TSA to discuss new security protocols developed in conjunction with U.S. intelligence authorities and other air carriers on rules specifically for cargo planes carrying only mail, as requested by shippers such as the Postal
Service. These new protocols were issued based on TSA Security Directive and Emergency Amendment in the wake of the plot to attack U.S. air cargo originating from Yemen in October 2010.       5.4 Protection and Safeguard of U.S. Mails       Except as otherwise permitted by law or
provided herein, mail, while in the custody of FedEx, or our employees or agents, will not be opened, searched, or seized unless expressly authorized by a Postal Inspector. In situations where other law enforcement agencies request access to the
mail, a properly executed Federal search warrant is required. FedEx shall attempt to notify a Postal Inspector of any warrants served for mail in the custody of FedEx before coordinating the warrant execution.   
  Address information from the mail in the custody and control of FedEx may only be recorded or disclosed to another law enforcement or government agency
upon expressed approval by a Postal Service Inspector, except as required for operational purposes regarding the sorts and transportation of the mail. FedEx shall notify a Postal Inspector of all requests from law enforcement for such information.
     In situations where FedEx has reason to believe that mail contains dangerous and injurious contents that pose potential danger to FedEx
employees, equipment, products, or facilities, FedEx will take actions necessary to secure the item and minimize the risk. The Inspection Service will be immediately notified and FedEx and the Inspection Service will coordinate the disposition of
the item.

5.5 Personnel Screening Procedures       FedEx is committed to providing the Postal Service with qualified staff that has passed our stringent screening process. To ensure that we comply with Postal Service Security Investigations Service Center
(SISC) and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personnel security screening and reporting requirements, FedEx conducts a thorough screening (Section 5.5.1) of all candidates for employment.      We will provide the Postal Service with exceptional data protection based on security measures implemented in a proactive and planned manner. Our security best practices mandate an integrated approach to
the protection of assets. Administrative, operations, personnel, physical, and technical security solutions must interact to achieve the overall goal of protecting Postal Service data and all other information assets that come under our control. Our
successful data security approach addresses both deliberate and inadvertent data loss, compromise, corruption, and denial of use.       5.6
Personnel Security Training       FedEx will train all support staff in the Postal Service Security Policies and Procedures, the use and support
of security tools and products, security compliance requirements, and the penalties of noncompliance. We will conduct random, unannounced security audits of our facilities to ensure compliance with security procedures. We maintain an extensive
Security Awareness, Training, and Education (SATE) program to ensure that all employees are aware of their responsibilities, the sensitivity of the information to which they will have access, and the standards of conduct required of each employee.
Mandatory annual and semi-annual training courses are accessible online.       5.7 Security Breach Procedures    
  Our approach to security breach management is based on our extensive experience in industry best practices, which is focused on:   

Incident Recording.  All incidents will be recorded.      

Categorization and Prioritization.  Security breaches will be matched against existing problems or known errors in an attempt to identify
previous solutions or workarounds that expedite resolution. Failing that, breaches will be prioritized to ensure assignment of adequate resources for investigation and diagnosis.      

Investigation and Diagnostics.  Security breach details and checks will be assessed against existing intelligence to identify an approved
resolution.          

Escalation.  If escalation is required, subject matter experts (SMEs) will work to develop workarounds or solutions.

Workaround and Incident Closure.  The security breach knowledge base will be updated and customers will be contacted via surveys to gauge
satisfaction.          

Restoration of Service.  Communication will be maintained between the customer and security personnel through all phases of security breach
management to restore service to normal Postal Service operations.

6.0 Sustainability Plan    
    
    FedEx is committed to operating and innovating in new ways that not only benefit our Postal Service
customer, but our industry.     
   This FedEx Sustainability Plan presents the details of our corporate sustainability initiatives and
supporting metrics. We will work collaboratively with the Postal Service to develop initiatives to improve services and meet their guidelines. As shown in our attached corporate sustainability plan, FedEx is concerned for the environment, has
proactively taken steps to mitigate our fleet footprint, and reports periodically on our environmental efficiency.      FedEx is familiar with the
Postal Service sustainability goals and implementation initiatives, and our Sustainability Plan is responsive to the Postal Service plan. The Postal Service produces an annual Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, including key performance
indicators (KPI) on greenhouse gas emissions, facility energy use, transportation fuel use, and solid waste recycled. We collect and report on those KPIs annually. As a self-funded Federal agency, the Postal Service is not required to meet all of
the Federal sustainability requirements in Executive Orders 13423 and 13514 or Presidential Memoranda for fleet management and bio-based purchasing, but where possible, the Postal Service voluntarily sets specific objectives that follow the Federal
goals. Our Sustainability Plan also follows this guidance. The Postal Service reports annually on the following goals:       

Reduce total postal vehicle petroleum fuel use by 20% by FY 15.          6.1 Environmental Initiatives       FedEx is a symbol for leadership in global sustainability
efforts. We think this sets us apart from other companies. FedEx actively works with government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), manufacturers, suppliers, and other fleet operators to introduce fuel-efficient and low-carbon,
alternative-fuel technologies, and to promote the transformation of transportation through our advocacy for electrification. FedEx is a leader among U.S.-based logistics and transportation companies in this regard. We welcome the opportunity to
provide consultative services to, and benchmarking opportunities for the Postal Service to share best practices and information about our most successful projects. The Postal Service has benchmarked with FedEx previously on this issue and FedEx will
continue to work with the Postal Service in the future. FedEx will follow all Department of Transportation, International Air Transport Association and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for fleet modernization recommendations, fuel
efficiency, and other climate change criteria.       6.1.1 Collaborative Efforts with Postal Service    
  As part of this solicitation, FedEx proposes the following efforts to meet or exceed the goals that it has established for itself. It will also be able to
meet or exceed all Postal Service objectives.       6.2 Current Sustainability Initiatives and Metrics    
  FedEx is committed to sustainability efforts and has a number of efforts in progress. The FedEx annual Global Citizenship Report (GCR) presents our
initiatives and metrics. EarthSmart@Work, a program in the FedEx key focus area of Environment and Efficiency, is responsible for setting, implementing, and achieving goals to minimize our impact on the environment.   
   INITIATIVES.  Through FedEx s EarthSmart@Work Program, we have the following initiatives, which are highlighted from the 2011 GCR:

United States Postal Service       Air Cargo Network       Volume 1       November 6, 2012    

Greenhouse Gas Emissions.  Our current emissions goals include:      

Reducing aircraft emissions intensity by 30% by 2020, on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis, from a baseline year of 2005. This represents an
increase in our global aircraft emissions intensity goal by 50% from the original target established in 2005.          

Increasing FedEx Express vehicle efficiency by 20% by 2020, including by supporting new technology, from a baseline year of 2005.

Getting 30% of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by the year 2030 and expanding on-site generation of, and continuing procurement of renewable energy
for our facilities.          

Aircraft.  Decreasing aircraft CO   2    emissions intensity by 30% by 2020, on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis from a baseline year of 2005. This
represents an increase in our global aircraft emissions intensity goal of 50% from the original target established in 2005.          

Fuel Sense   Optimization of flight planning, aircraft weight reduction, and flight efficiencies are a few of the 30 Fuel Sense programs. Fuel
Sense helped cut our jet fuel consumption by 40.5 million gallons and CO   2    emissions by nearly 388,000 metric tons in FY 11.          

We are also introducing Boeing 777F aircraft, which use 18% less fuel than the MD-11 aircraft and provide greater payload capacity. In addition, we are
planning to introduce the new Boeing 767 aircraft into our fleet in FY 13, which will further contribute to our ability to meet our newly revised aircraft emissions intensity reduction target.      

Vehicles.  Improving vehicle fuel efficiency of the FedEx Express surface delivery vehicle fleet by 20% by 2020   including support of new
technology   using 2005 as the baseline year.          

Zero-emission, all-electric vehicles   The FedEx zero-emission, all-electric fleet of vehicles reduces emissions and fuel usage in major
metropolitan areas. Coupled with the restructuring of routes and right-sizing of our fleet, these FedEx vehicles have helped us save 75 million gallons of fuel to date and have reduced our fuel consumption in North America, Europe, and Asia by
more than 25%.          

Alternative fuel vehicles (hybrid-electric and all-electric)   FedEx Express has increased the size of its alternative-fuel fleet by 18% in FY 12,
with a total of 364 hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) and 118 electric vehicles (EVs) in service by the end of FY 12. These vehicles have saved 345,000 gallons of fuel and logged 12.1 million miles since being introduced into our fleet. We also
continue to retrofit conventional internal combustion engine vehicles to make our local delivery vehicles more fuel efficient through our Vehicle Refresh Plan.      

Alternative Aviation Fuel.  Getting 30% of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by 2030   FedEx is collaborating with the aviation industry
to develop alternative fuel for long-distance transport. Working with The Nature Conservancy, we have brought together leading experts to help us consider every angle of the issue. We are consulting with the FAA and the Departments of Agriculture,
Defense, and Energy. We are collaborating with specialists from the emerging alternative fuels industry, airplane manufacturers, airlines, and conservation organizations. Emissions reduction, energy conservation, affordability, and the preservation
of land and the world s food supply   all these factor into the selection process. Our goal is to source 30% of our aviation fuel from alternatives by 2030.      

Solar Facilities. Greening our facilities through the generation and continuing procurement of renewable and alternate energy   Currently,
we have 6 solar energy facilities   5 in the U.S. and one in Europe   which together have reduced CO   2    emissions by an estimated 6,858 metric tons.          Environmental Management
System.  Implementing an Environmental Management System to provide a formal process to improve environmental efficiency and performance to achieve ISO 14001 certification. Currently 51 of our facilities have achieved this certification. 
       Recycling.  Through our EarthSmart@Work programs, we are finding ways to responsibly recycle everything from paper to motor oil.
FedEx Ground is leading the charge to reduce landfill waste through Ground Green, an EarthSmart@Work initiative. We are working in conjunction with the EPA Waste Wise program on this comprehensive campaign that encourages team members to recycle
everything from paper to cardboard to wood pallets. Since the program s inception in 2006, waste removal costs are down 25% in one district alone, and millions of pounds of goods have been saved from the landfill.

Carbon-Neutral Envelope Shipping.  For every FedEx Express envelope shipped, we will offset the
carbon emissions related to our transport, no matter where we travel, at no cost to the customer. The annual estimated carbon offset through this program is equivalent to planting 2,179,487 seedlings and letting them grow for 10 years. 
       Paper and Packaging.  For more than a decade, FedEx has worked to minimize the environmental impact of our packaging wherever
possible, by using recycled content and maximizing recyclability. Today, most FedEx packaging is recyclable and contains recycled materials. For example, the FedEx Express Overnight Envelope is composed of 100% recycled cardboard. Changes in the
recycled content of our legal-sized reusable FedEx Envelope, which uses dual tear strips to extend its usefulness, resulted in an annual paperboard reduction of 100,000 pounds.  Figure 6-1  presents our progress in this area.

Products        Figure 6-1. FedEx Commitment   Recycled Material        FedEx Express
commits to using recycled material in our packaging products and envelopes.    

Noise Abatement.  FedEx founder
and CEO Frederick W. Smith says,  Concerning noise control, FedEx and many carriers have worked for years to reduce noise through quieter aircraft and better abatement procedures such as reduced power climbs and improved descent patterns. 
      METRICS.  FedEx tracks the following metrics and reports on the progress through in annual GCR. The following are highlights:

Enterprise CO  2    Emissions    (in metric tons). We report on total direct greenhouse-gas emissions which are directly proportional to economic growth.

Aircraft Emissions  (in metric tons). We increased our global aircraft CO   2    emissions intensity reduction goal by 50% to a 30% intensity reduction by 2020, still using FY 05 as the baseline year.

Vehicle Fuel Efficiency.  Our goal for 2020 is to improve the fuel efficiency of the FedEx Express surface delivery vehicle fleet by 20%, using
2005 as the baseline year.          

Electric and Hybrid Electric Fleet.  We increased our global EV and HEV fleet to 482 vehicles, an increase of nearly 18%. The fleet has logged
almost 12.1 million miles, saving approximately 345,000 gallons of fuel.          

Solar Electricity.  We have generated more than 18 GWh of solar electricity since we built our first solar facility. We now have 6 solar energy
facilities, 5 in the U.S. and 1 in Europe. These 6 facilities alone have reduced our CO   2    emissions by an estimated 6,858 metric tons.          

Renewable Energy Credits.  In FY 11, FedEx Office      purchased 33,333 Renewable Energy Credits (REC) to offset emissions associated with the electricity we used in FY 11 and to support efforts to generate electricity
from renewable sources. Each REC purchased represents 1,000 kWh of electricity produced by a renewable energy facility.          

Waste Streams.  In FY 11, the majority of our waste (95.32%) consisted of nonhazardous and municipal solid waste, much like regular
household garbage. The remaining waste streams included hazardous waste, which is dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment;  universal waste,  which includes batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment,
and light bulbs; and e-waste.

United States Postal Service       Air Cargo Network       Volume 1       November 6, 2012    

Recycling  (in millions of pounds and percentages). We recycle and reuse a significant amount of waste, and we look for new technologies to help
us increase this amount. In FY 11, we recycled 6.4 million more pounds of the waste generated at our facilities and increased the percentage of waste recycled to 36%.      

ISO 14001 Certification.  ISO 14001 provides a framework for a holistic, strategic approach to an organization s environmental policy,
plans, and actions. FedEx is evaluating the feasibility of obtaining ISO 14001 certification in additional facilities as 51 of our facilities in Europe meet those requirements.      

FSC Certified Paper.  We seek to buy paper for our FedEx Office Print and Ship Centers from suppliers that have been certified by the Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC), which helps ensure responsible forest management. In FY 11, we increased the percentage of FSC-certified paper used in our FedEx facilities to 80%.

7.0 Subcontracting Plan (Provisions 3-1, 4-1, 4-2, Clauses 3-1, 3-2)    
    
    FedEx provides the Postal Service with the best value for every dollar we spend on subcontracted
goods and services.     
   The FedEx subcontracting plan for the Postal Service ACN contract is compliant with Clauses 3-1 and 3-2 of
the RFP. It also fulfills the requirements of the Postal Service s Supplying Principles and Practices (SP Ps). We are committed to ensure that small, minority, or small woman-owned businesses (SMWOB) are fairly represented under this
contract. We will provide subcontracting activity reports under this contract on a calendar-quarter basis as described in Clause 3-2 of this solicitation within 15 calendar days after the end of the quarter, or more frequently, if the Postal Service
Contracting Officer (CO) requires.      We understand that this plan must be approved by both the Postal Service and FedEx prior to the award of a
contract. Additionally, all subcontracts regardless of type will include the clauses required by the Postal Service. FedEx understands that it cannot enter into any first-tier subcontract to a Postal Service ACN contract for an estimated or actual
amount of [ * ] or more without obtaining written clearance from the Postal Service CO that the proposed subcontractor is in compliance with the equal opportunity requirements and is eligible for award.

Call center/help desk management.          7.4 Method Used to Develop Subcontracting Goals       FedEx has a disciplined and logical
process and methodology to develop our subcontracting goals. Our purchasing agents develop, on an annual basis, a sourcing plan that identifies the commodities and services that are under contract with projections for bid during the following
calendar year. We will consider factors such as volume by service type, subcontractor performance, and customer ordering projections. Based on the calculated dollar amounts, we compare our current budgeted subcontract dollars to the projected
spending, and arrive at our average percentages for the next year. Our subcontractor goals are consistent with, and accurately reflect FedEx s actual subcontracting report for the electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).   
   7.5 Method Used to Identify Potential Sources       FedEx uses several proven methods to advertise to potential sources. We monitor Web sites to meet our subcontracting goals, including those of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, SBA
Matchmaking Sessions, SBA.gov, Mid-South Minority Business Council, FedEx Supplier Contact Management System, and System for Award Management (SAM) which is formerly the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Outreach efforts include involvement
with trade associations, business development organizations, conferences, and trade fairs to locate small, minority, and woman-owned business sources. We provide encouragement to subcontractors through workshops, seminars, and training, and
monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program s requirements. These efforts demonstrate FedEx s commitment to ensuring that businesses, other than large businesses, have an equitable opportunity to compete and participate
in subcontracts.       7.6 Indirect Cost Statement       Indirect costs have been included in the dollar and percentage subcontracting goals stated above in  Figure 7-1 , in Section 7.1. The method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect
costs to be incurred with small business concerns is calculated based on the previous year s subcontractor spend, factored with estimates for the coming year.      We require that our supply chain specialists include at least one SMWOB concern in all RFPs for indirect costs. If a small business concern is not included, an exception form detailing why one was not
included must be submitted and signed by the Vice President for the applicable engagement.       7.7 Subcontracting Program Administrator
      Our subcontracting program administrator and alternate are presented in  Figure 7-2 .

Figure 7-2. Subcontracting Program Administrator    
   
    To effectively implement this plan for efficient contract performance, the subcontracting program administrator will
perform the following functions:       

Assist with SMWOB concerns, by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules, to
facilitate participation by such concerns. Where FedEx s lists of potential small subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business concerns an opportunity to compete over a period of time.

Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of small concerns in all  make-or-buy  decisions.

  Efficiency FEDEX DOESN T JUST WANT TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HOW THE WORLD IS CONNECTED We want to connect the world responsibly and resourcefully. The commercial transportation industry has no single solution for reducing its
environmental footprint. But FedEx is committed to operating and innovating in new ways that can help our business as well as our industry. Environment and Efficiency is one of four specific areas where we document our progress each year. Along with
Economics and Access, Community and Disaster Relief, and People and Workplace, we offer data, information, and examples in our annual Global Citizenship Report of how we live up to our responsibilities. FedEx team members contribute to our progress
in these four important areas, their actions speaking just as loudly as the numbers that mark our progress. FedEx was the first U.S. transportation-logistics company to set long-term goals to reduce aircraft emissions. In 2005, we set goals to
reduce aircraft emissions 20 percent by 2020, to increase FedEx Express vehicle efficiency by 20 percent by 2020, and to expand on-site renewable energy generation and the procurement of renewable energy credits. FedEx was the first company in the
U.S. transportation-logistics industry to establish a Citizenship Blog, to report global Scope 1 (direct) greenhouse-gas emissions in 2008, and to disclose climate risks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. For more information on risks
reported, see pages 19 and 71 of our Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K 2012. Our current emissions goals include: Reducing aircraft emissions intensity 30 percent by 2020, on an emissions per available-ton-mile basis, from a baseline year
of 2005  this represents an increase in our global aircraft emissions intensity goal by 50 percent from the original target established in 2005. Increasing FedEx Express vehicle efficiency by 20 percent by 2020, including via support of new
technology, from a baseline year of 2005. Getting 30 percent of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by the year 2030. Expanding on-site generation of and continuing procurement of renewable energy for our facilities. Seeking LEED (Leadership in
Energy   Environmental Design) certification on all new FedEx Express buildings in the U.S. Our strategy for reaching these goals includes: Minimizing our environmental footprint while serving our customers and growing our business. Maximizing
efficiencies. Supporting innovation for eco-technologies. Providing leadership in responsible environmental stewardship. Helping connect the world in responsible and resourceful ways. We continue to look at and identify our areas of exposure with
regard to greenhouse-gas emissions and other environmental factors. We then determine the level of potential impact and set appropriate plans and goals needed to shrink our environmental footprint. Finally, we continually monitor our progress toward
minimizing our impact and achieving our goals. Many departments are involved in issues of environmental stewardship. Their collective efforts are led by Mitch Jackson, Vice President for Environmental Affairs and Sustainability. In 2011, we
reconstituted our governance oversight with the FedEx Enterprise Sustainability Council (FESC), a senior officer-level council that develops and guides implementation of our sustainability strategy. Sustainability Impact Teams were also established
under the FESC management structure to ensure that our various operating companies can discuss, plan, and act in harmony on our sustainability strategy. We also actively work with government agencies, NGOs, manufacturers, suppliers, and other fleet
operators to introduce fuel-efficient and low-carbon, alternative-fuel technologies, and to promote the transformation of transportation through our advocacy for electrification. FedEx has done more than any other U.S.-based logistics and
transportation company in this regard. FedEx was the first company in the U.S. transportation-logistics industry to push for commercial-vehicle, fuel-economy legislation, which was enacted in the Energy Independence   Security Act of 2007. And
we helped create a set of principles to inform and support this first-ever national greenhouse-gas/fuel-efficiency program for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles the only company in our industry to do so. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR APPROACH TO
CARBON LEGISLATION, SEE THE FOLLOWING: FedEx addresses the feasibility of the concept of a price on carbon emissions  blog.fedex.designcdt.com/node/810. Frederick W. Smith addresses the carbon tax debate while speaking at the Global Green

  Efficiency EARTHSMART . FEDEX SOLUTIONS FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE WORLD. FedEx works to achieve our ambitious goals through EarthSmart, the FedEx roadmap fat operating in an increasingly sustainable way and engaging our team members,
customers, suppliers, vendors, and the communities where we operate to help us reduce the environmental impact of our daily business operations. We introduced EarthSmart in 2009 as a way to underscore our commitment to minimize our impact on the
environment. Our aim is to find or create new ways not only to improve our own company s environmental performance, but also to point the way for other companies in our own industry and beyond. EarthSmart includes three pillars: EarthSmart
Innovations: Customer and FedEx solutions related to services and assets. EarthSmart   Work: Workplace employee-engagement programs. EarthSmart Outreach: Philanthropic and volunteer efforts. INTRODUCING FEDEX CARBON-NEUTHAL ENVELOPE SHIPPING In
April 2012, FedEx introduced our latest EarthSmart innovation FedEx carbon-neutral envelope shipping. For every FedEx Express18 envelope shipped, FedEx will offset the carbon emissions related to its transport, no matter where it travels. The
program helps improve the carbon footprint not only at FedEx, but also for our customers  businesses. But unlike our competitors, we won t charge customers a fee to offset the carbon produced when they ship an envelope. Annual Estimated
Carbon Offset We calculate the emissions it takes to transport an envelope to its destination, and we pay an offset provider to offset those emissions for every envelope we carry. The annual estimated carbon offset by this program is equivalent to
planting 2,179,487 seedlings and letting them grow for 10 years. We work with BP Target Neutral, a not-for-profit offset provider whose projects reduce, replace, and neutralize carbon. Currently, BP Target Neutral invests in six large carbon-offset
projects, which will offset the carbon FedEx emits transporting envelopes. Projects are located in: China-micro hydro; The Netherlands biogas; Tanzania-reforestation; Thailand-landfill-to-gas, Turkey-wind power; and U.S.-landfill-to-gas. For

  Efficiency GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ENTERPRISE CO2 EMISSIONS Our Scope 1 and 3 CO2 emissions increased slightly in FY11 due to increased shipping volumes, which came with improved global economic conditions and strong demand for our services.
However, we have made progress in decoupling economic growth from our direct greenhouse-gas emissions during that time period. Our Scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2 absolute emissions increased by 4 percent in FY11 compared with FY10, while still remaining at 3
percent below FY09 levels. In FY11, we increased out total annual revenue by 13 percent over FY10. Enterprise CO2 Emissions (in metric tons) GREENING OUR FLEET AIRCRAFT EMISSIONS We calculate aircraft emissions intensity metrics by dividing the
total CO2 emissions of our company-operated aircraft by the available ton miles (ATM), or the tons of carrying capacity by miles traveled. Aircraft Emissions DEFINING SCOPE EMISSIONS Our Scope 1 emissions include those generated by our
company-operated aircraft and surface vehicle fleets, and on-site combustion of diesel, natural gas, and other fuels used at our hub, station, and office locations. Our Scope 2 emissions are indirectly generated through our consumption of purchased
electricity, heat, and steam at our facilities and FedEx Office Print and Ship Centers In FY11, our Scope 2 emissions decreased slightly due to ongoing energy efficiency initiatives at our facilities (see  Greening Our Facilities  for more
information). Our Scope 3 emissions comprise other indirect emissions, including those from FedEx Express feeder aircraft contract operators and the fuel we sell to FedEx Ground independent contractors. We compiled our greenhouse emissions inventory
using data and emissions factors in accordance with WorId Resources Institute technical guidance. In previous years, we tracked and reported this data on a calendar-year basis. However, in order to be consistent with how we report on other data in
this report, we are transitioning to a fiscal-year reporting basis for this metric going forward. Our previous goal by 2020 was to reduce our CO2, emissions intensity or emissions per available ton mile by 20 percent as compared with our 2005
performance. We are pleased to announce that FedEx has increased our global aircraft emissions intensity goal by 50 percent to a 30 percent intensity reduction by 2020, still using FY05 as the baseline year. In FY11, we reduced aircraft CO2
omissions intensity by 4 percent, bringing our cumulative reduction to 13.8 percent compared with FY05. The majority of this reduction was due to replacement of older, more-inefficient aircraft. By 2015, we will have replaced all our less-efficient
727s with more fuel-efficient and greater payload 757 aircraft. We are also introducing Boeing 777 aircraft, which use 18 percent less fuel than the MD-11 aircraft and provide greater payload capacity. In addition, we are planning to introduce the
new Boeing 767 aircraft to our fleet in FY13, which will further contribute to our ability to meet our newly revised aircraft emissions intensity reduction target. Other operational activities play a significant role, and these advancements are
managed under our Fuel Sense program. We have programs to optimize fuel usage from gate to gate, starting with preflight. For example, aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU) usage is managed by providing ground support equipment 2011 GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP

  Efficiency in parking positions. To supplement ground support equipment, gate stands provide power from either a power converter or a portable power unit, and portable air conditioning carts keep the aircraft cool in hot summer months. This
equipment is monitored in real time and information is provided to all the stakeholders, from ground support teams that can track the portable units in real time and dispatch them to the required gate to the flight crewmembers so they can determine
when to start the APU. We also have gate-to-gate programs to facilitate taxiing with one less engine and for optimized profile descent (also known as continuous descent approach) prior to landing. These procedures provide a repeatable and
predictable trajectory that both Air Traffic Control and crewmembers can use to minimize fuel usage. We also have a mechanism for crewmembers to share new ideas and provide feedback on their individual contributions to the program. Whether on the
ground or in the air in every phase of the flight, preflight, taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, landing, and taxi, we look for programs to optimize fuel usage and reduce emissions. At FedEx, small changes through individual contributions a
mount to a big impact in emission reductions over many daily operations worldwide. VEHICLE FUEL EFFICIENCY Our goal for 2020 is to improve the fuel efficiency of the FedEx Express surface/delivery vehicle fleet by 20 percent, using 2005 as the
baseline year. We are happy to announce that we are still on track to meet that target, having achieved a 16.6 percent improvement in the FedEx Express vehicle fleet between FY05 and FY11. Vehicle Fuel Efficiency The FedEx Express pickup and
delivery vehicle fleet follows a three-tired approach to improve vehicle fuel efficiency: Reduce, Replace, and Revolutionize. This means we develop vehicle technologies for the future while making the best use of the conventional vehicles we operate
today. FedEx Express has increased the size of its alternative-fuel fleet by 18 percent in FY12, with a total of 364 hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) and 118 electric vehicles (EVs) in service by the end of FY12. These vehicles seved 345,000 gallons
of fuel and logged 12.1 million miles since being introduced to our fleet. We also continue to retrofit conventional internal-combustion-engine vehicles to make our local delivery vehicles more fuel efficient through our  Vehicle Refresh
Plan  Our engineers use detailed analysis techniques to understand the power and torque requirements of our various route profiles. Matching the right vehicle to each respective route yield significant economic and environmental returns. This
program has saved over 75 million gallons of fuel since its inception. Electric and Hybrid-Electric Fleet EARTHSMART @ WORK: WORKPLACE EMPLOYEE-ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS Fuel Sence: Optimization of flight planning, aircraft weight reduction, and flight
efficiencies are a few of the 30 different Fuel Sense programs. Fuel Sense helped cut our jet fuel consumption by 40.5 million gallons and CO emissions by nearly 388,000 metric tons in FY11. Reduce, Replace and Revolutionize: Includes restructuring
FedEx Express routes to reduce miles driven and vehicles needed, matching vehicles to routes by energy requirements, and using smart changing algorithms to control the impact on the electric grid. To learn more about our EarthSmart programs, go to

350,000-square-foot solar-powered facility in Oakland, Calif, was the largest commercial solar rooftop installation at the time it was built in 2005. More than 5,700 solar electric panels cover the 81,000 square feet of roof space, producing 904
kilowatts of power In 2008, FedEx Freight introduced two solar-power installations at facilities in Whittier and Fontana, Calif., both systems providing a substantial portion of the facilities  annual electricity needs In late 2009, FedEx
Ground installed the nation s then largest rooftop solar-electric system at its distribution huh in Woodbridge, N J Capable of producing approximately 26 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, the system provides up to 30 percent of the
hub s annual energy needs. the solar-electric system at the FedEx Express facility in Cologne, Germany, went online in 2010 and has produced nearly 1.8 gigawatt hours of power to dale. In May 2011, the 1.13 megawatt FedEx Ground Railto, Calif.,
solar electricity system went online and meets approximately 30 percent of that facility s annual electricity needs. The FedEx Express Oakland, Calif, huh is also using Bloom Energy fuel Cell technology for electric generation. FedEx installed
live 100 kilowatt fuel cells at the hub, which can run on almost any hydrocarbon fuel ethonol, biodieseI, methane, and natural gas. These fuel cells require no combustion, producing virtually no NOx, SOx, or other smog forming participates. Dunning
on natural gas, the fuel cells provide each facility with MO kilowatts of electricity by Converting natural gas to electricity. They thereby reduce the strain and dependency on the local electrical distribution grid and further our strategic

United States Postal Service Air Cargo Network Volume 1 November 6, 2012 PAPER AND
PACKAGING RFSPONSIBLY SOURCFED PAPER We seek to buy paper for cur FedFx Office* Print and Shin Centers from suppliers that have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which helps ensure responsible forest management. In FY11, we
increased the percentage of FSC certified paper used in our FedEx Office Print and Ship Centers to 80 percent FSC-Certified Paper At our 1,800-plus FedEx Office locations in the U.S. Canada, and internationally, we provide consumers sustainable
solutions to choose from through our diverse portfolio of paper product offerings More than 70 percent of our paper products contain recycled content. We also offer tree-free paper selections made from natural plant fivers such as cotton. Through
FedEx Office, we provide services to efficiently transmit digitized information, so customers can have document professionally printed and finished closer to where they are needed, reducing the resources required to physically transport shipments
  and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I addition all of the FedEx operating companies are working to increase the amount of responsibly sourced paper used for internal operations. For instance, in FY11 we increased the percentage of paper
produced from recycled content that we track to 16 percent from 6 percent, resulting in an overall increase of 141 percent for that type of paper consumed on our offices and facilities. This increase was due both to improved reporting of recycled
paper usage by our key supplier as well as enhanced product offerings to meet the demand for recycled paper content across the enterprise. PACKAGING For more than a decade, we have worked to minimize the environmental impact of our packaging
wherever possible by using recycled content and maximizing recyclability. At the FedEx Packaging Lab, our engineers use the latest materials and tools to solve shipping challenges, including environmental ones, and today, most FedEx packaging is
recyclable and contains recycled materials. The iconic FedEx Express overnight envelope is composed of 100 percent recycled content and are recyclable. FedEx 10-kilogram and 25-kilogram boxes contain a minimum of 70 percent recycled content and
recyclable. FedEx boxes sold at our retail locations contain a minimum of 20 percent recycled content and are recyclable. Most FedEx Paks contain 60 percent recycled content and are recyclable at select location. With a continued focus on saving
energy and reducing materials, we have made minor changes to our packaging with major results. For example, in 2001 we reduced the amount of plastic in the FedEx envelope pouch by almost 500,000 pounds per year. In 2003, we introduced a legal-size
reusable envelope that uses dual tear-strips to extend the usefulness of the product while cutting waste. In 2004, we increased the recycled content of the FedEx Pak from 25 percent to 60 percent. And as recently as this year, we changed the
material of the legal-size reusable FedEx Envelope, which resulted in an annual paperboard reduction of 100,000 pounds. EARTHSMART @ WORK:WORKPLACE EMPLOUEE-ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS LEAF: FedEx Freight LEAFs educate and encourage team members to conserve

United States Postal Service Air Cargo Network Volume 1 November 6. 2012 In 2009, FedEx
Ground started using a special machine that shreds used cardboard packaging into a flexible packing material called  cardboard shred   This cardboard shred now replaces traditional packing materials such as Styrofoam peanuts and bubble
wrap, and it diverts tons of used cardboard from landfills These machines can also cut the cardboard shred into a variety of sizes, allowing for repacking of different size boxes, and are portable enough to fit easily in local sorting stations where
space is limited Since 2009, FedEx Ground has placed 40 of these machines at key hubs and stations so far, with an annual estimated rate of return of 13 percent on this investment by eliminating the need to purchase new packing materials. In
addition, the boxes used to send paper reams to FedEx Office locations are made of top tier green materials. The paper board utilized for these boxes is a chip paper board that is 100 percent recycled, 101 percent recyclable, and 100 percent made
from post-consumer reclaimed fiber. And it is printed with water and soy based inks. This product is certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council, as are the facilities that manufacture the box. for more information on our sustainable solutions, go

1.0 Day Network Operating Plan    
    
    FedEx, which has the world s largest cargo aircraft fleet, will build upon our 12 years of
successful support of the United States Postal Service to meet its Air Cargo Network requirements for mail delivery with consistently reliable and dependable service.     
   FedEx will provide a Postal Service Day Network that will deliver all air transportation and ancillary services to all required service points identified by the Postal Service in the Air Cargo Network
(ACN) solicitation from Day 1 of the contract. We possess the immediate capacity to provide this service six days per week at the historical non-peak and peak volume levels identified in Attachment 2, Air Stops   Projected Volumes of
the solicitation. As illustrated in  Figure 1-1 , this network includes all 82 required Day Network service points and 3 FedEx hubs.       

Figure 1-1. FedEx Air Cargo Day Network    
   FedEx understands the Postal Service culture, processes, routing, and tender requirements better than any other air freight company.
       Single Vendor Network Benefits       Use of a single carrier will provide the Postal Service with needed efficiencies and cost savings. In a multiple-carrier environment, capacity is deployed less efficiently, adding cost and additional
handling unnecessarily. For example, if the planned volume could be accommodated on a single scheduled movement with one carrier, splitting this volume over two carriers would require scheduled conveyances from both carriers, which adds cost and
inefficiency. With multiple carriers, the costs of monitoring and coordinating activities would increase for the Postal Service. Policies and procedures for the carriers would inevitably differ, creating opportunities for errors, confusion, and
potential delay of mail delivery.      FedEx and the Postal Service have established and will maintain a shared aviation network that has enabled
the Postal Service to significantly improve the service provided to its customers while continuously reducing the cost. For the past 12 years, FedEx, as the majority carrier, has transported

Express, Priority, and First Class mail to and from all of the points covered in this solicitation. Since 2006, we have also carried HAZMAT, live, perishable, and registered mail. As the largest
carrier for the Postal Service, FedEx has provided this service at historical volume levels through peak days of more than [ * ] to low-volume days covering non-widely observed holidays.      Since the inception of the Postal Service Shared Network, the Postal Service has enjoyed greatly improved service to their customers, stability in their network provider, and reduced costs. The
structure of having one carrier responsible for the vast majority of the volume provides the Postal Service with the most cost efficient, simple and reliable air transportation network. At current Postal Service volume levels, other than a few
large volume locations, there is not enough mail to warrant the redundancies under a two-vendor network operational concept.     FedEx has been a
collaborative business partner with the Postal Service for the past 12 years, and has been extremely responsive to requests for increasing volume, expanding service coverage, adding new products with unique handling characteristics, and maintaining
cost controls. We believe that a single-provider network, with its operating efficiencies, extensive network connections, service capabilities and lower cost structure, will provide the greatest long-term benefits for the Postal Service,
particularly at a time of fiscal need and budget awareness across the nation. FedEx has the aircraft, equipment, capacity, network reach, and management capability to continue serving the Postal Service in an efficient and low-cost, single-vendor
operation well into the future.      The ongoing strategic alliance between FedEx and the Postal Service under the Postal Service Transportation
Agreement (Transportation Agreement) brings noteworthy advantages to a renewal contract for the ACN. The Postal Service and FedEx jointly developed many of the processes and procedures that are currently being employed in the Transportation
Agreement network. No other air cargo carrier has the benefit of this long and efficient operational experience with the Postal Service. FedEx has worked with the Postal Service to optimize schedules and tender times, eliminate excessive cost, and
increase efficiencies, as shown in  Figure 1-2 .       Figure 1-2. FedEx Key Differentiators    
   FedEx has a number of key differentiators for operation of the Postal Service Air Cargo Network.    

FedEx Key Services    
     
     Differentiators     

Air Cargo Network:  FedEx has the world s largest cargo aircraft fleet to meet the Postal Service s aviation requirements with reliable and dependable
service.  
     
          With more than 634 aircraft, FedEx has the world s largest fleet of cargo
aircraft.    

We are the only company with proven experience supporting requirements of

FedEx Key Services    
     
     Differentiators     

Transition:  An award to FedEx ensures the Postal Service a no-risk, no-cost contract transition.  
     
           Our knowledge and understanding of the Postal Service mission, operations, culture, and
technology, and our business partner approach means a non-disruptive, no-risk transition to the ACN contract.    
 
         Innovation and Investment:  FedEx is an
innovation leader in air cargo logistics.   

FedEx is ahead of plan to increase the fuel efficiency of our pickup
and delivery fleet by 20% between 2005 and 2020.    

In FY12, approximately half of our $4 billion in capital expenditures
is related to modernizing our air fleet.    

FedEx and the Postal Service invented the Transportation Agreement
network design, significantly improving the performance and reducing the cost of the air transport service, proving that our vendor-customer team excels in innovative practices.    
     On-Time Delivery for the Postal Service       FedEx has achieved service levels outlined in the                    [ * ]   
  Transportation Agreement in alliance with the Postal Service since 2001. Throughout that time, our extensive cargo Day Network transport system has
demonstrated our capacity and capability to handle the historical volumes required by the Postal Service on weekdays and weekends, and during non-peak and peak periods. FedEx has delivered high-quality services that have consistently met or exceeded
Postal Service mail delivery service requirements as shown in  Figure 1-3 .      Each of the FedEx Day Network airports across the nation is
currently staffed with all necessary personnel to manage the receipt, outbound loading, and inbound delivery of Postal Service cargo. FedEx accomplishes this through an advanced hub-and-spoke system that ensures meeting delivery time requirements in
all 82 ramp locations. FedEx is the only air cargo carrier that serves all 82 Postal Service locations and, as we have stated, FedEx has the world s largest air cargo fleet with 634 aircraft serving airports in more than 220 countries and
territories in all regions of the world. We can provide the capacity the Postal Service has outlined in Attachment 2 when and where it is needed without relying on availability of commercial, wet lease, or dry lease aircraft. In addition, FedEx is
continuously upgrading our fleet to offer needed capacities more efficiently and economically.       Program and Operational Support for the
Postal Service       The FedEx Postal Transportation Management Department (PTM), as described in Volume 1, Section 2.5, has been in place
since the inception of the contract relationship in 2001 and is a dedicated Program Management Office (PMO) whose single mission is service to the Postal Service. FedEx Managing Director Ron Stevens has directed this department since the inception
of the FedEx Postal Service strategic alliance. This department was created as the interface for the Postal Service and designed to be a one-stop shop for all things Postal. Regardless of the issue, the Postal Service communicates with a single
department. We recruited the best engineers in the country from our Air, Ground and Freight Services (AGFS) Division; knowledgeable in both ramp and hub operations and the planning process to support the Postal Service. These engineers, who are
strategically domiciled around the country and aligned with the Postal Service Areas, work daily with the Postal Service on tactical issues affecting service. They work with Global Network Planning (GNP) and the Global Operations Control Center
(GOCC) on issues regarding additional lift requirements as required. The PTM engineers also work closely with local management and the Terminal Handling Service (THS) providers on all operational issues. When an exception occurs, the PTM engineers
develop a corrective action and communicate it to the Postal Service in the local, area, and headquarters groups.      The engineers are also
responsible for developing and communicating the processes for any changes. The group has two dedicated engineers responsible for building the planning matrix each month. They work closely with the Postal Service planners on the volume request for
each schedule period and act as a secondary check on lane-level volume from one operating period to the next. PTM also has a dedicated Service Assurance Manager and two Operations Administrators. They provide reports and status updates

throughout the day on flight and sort activity as well as issues that may impact service, such as
contingency plans for weather events e.g. hurricanes and winter storms. The PTM team has experienced little turnover within the group since its inception. We feel this consistency in leadership at the management and engineer level has contributed to
on-going success of this alliance.      PTM coordinates with the FedEx AGFS Division, which operates the air cargo network, and with GNP and GOCC
that plan and manage flight operations, including the movement of Postal Service mail. AGFS operates the cargo system through its main Memphis World Hub and through four subordinate organizations that operate FedEx ramps at airports within their
respective regions.      PTM coordinates with AGFS headquarters in Memphis, TN, and with the field ramp location managers. AGFS has an extensive
management team to oversee the actual flight and logistics operations as illustrated in  Figure 1-4 . This figure shows the customer-focused FedEx team supporting the Postal Service, leveraging the capabilities of AGFS, and managed by ramp
managers at each service point to deliver mail. PTM also coordinates with GNP and GOCC for Postal Service mail scheduling as well as flight operations for the Day Network.   

Figure 1-4. Customer-Focused FedEx Mail Service Delivery Team    
   PTM coordinates with FedEx s AGFS, which operates the air cargo network and, with GNP and GOCC that, plan and manage flight
operations, including the movement of Postal Service mail.       PTM is the focal point for the Postal Service for planning and managing
delivery services, which are carried out by AGFS and the ramp managers and staff at each service point. This coordination involves managing freight volumes requested by the Postal Service, planning each monthly operating period, and daily
operational activity such as loading and launching aircraft, receiving, and tendering freight to the Postal Service or THS at the destination. Also critical to movement of Postal Service mail is the GOCC, as it operates the aviation services that
move the mail.      Packages are scanned and the scan data is transmitted to system collection points constantly as they move through the system.
This allows comprehensive reporting of results of each day s activity. PTM, GNP, and AGFS work together using well-defined and comprehensive communication channels.

Operating the most sophisticated air cargo network in the world requires immediate communication, the
ability to modify logistics operations swiftly and accurately, and total command of an exceptionally large fleet of aircraft. This is a complex management task, performed by demanding, outstanding, and talented professionals.   
   1.1 Tender and Delivery Times by Air Stop    
    
    FedEx is the only aviation supplier with staffed operating bases at all ACN Day Network airports.
    
   Specific tender and delivery times by air stop, including number and type of aircraft, are listed in Attachment 12, Tender and
Delivery Time Commitment. FedEx has an exemplary record over its 12-year history on the job. FedEx has consistently met or exceeded the tender time delivery requirement as shown in  Figure 1-3 . Even during our most challenging operating period
in December, with volume surges at twice our non-peak demand and extreme weather, FedEx still met the Postal Service on-time delivery requirement.       1.2 Operational Components of the SOW    
    
    FedEx has consistently met service level requirements for the Postal Service throughout our 12-year
service history.     
   Throughout our 12-year alliance with the Postal Service, FedEx has worked with the Postal Service to develop
many of the processes that are now used to perform aviation support under the Transportation Agreement.  Figure 1-5  illustrates the proven process flow from acceptance at the origin to delivery at the destination that we will use on the ACN
contract.         

Figure 1-5. FedEx Air Transport Mail Delivery Service Process    
   FedEx has developed a series of mature processes to move the air cargo from origin to destination, consistently meeting the contractual
delivery times.       As shown in  Figure 1-5 , FedEx accepts the cargo at the origin ramp and flies it to the FedEx hub airport, where it
is distributed to its correct outbound container and loaded onto an aircraft to fly to the destination airport. Each lane is managed through established scanning procedures to ensure the correct routing of the mail from origin to destination. A
 lane  describes the origin point to destination point routing of the mail, for example from origin city A to destination city B, e.g., from Atlanta to Albuquerque. The main processes in the transport of the mail as specified in the
solicitation are:

    FedEx has developed and will continue to use mature key processes for the Postal Service ACN that
have been thoroughly tested and proven over the 12-year history of the relationship.     
    Figure 1-6  compares the key
processes for the ACN contract to select processes of the current Transportation Agreement contract. We have developed these processes over time in collaboration with the Postal Service and will modify or continue processes as provided under the new
ACN contract. These service processes reflect how FedEx efficiently and effectively takes possession of, sorts (if necessary), transports, scans, loads, and delivers mail for the Postal Service.

With responsibility for scheduling and management across the FedEx Express global network, GNP and GOCC work closely with
PTM to ensure on-time delivery of the mail. The GOCC ( Figure 1-7 ) is fully staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year with highly skilled and experienced airline operations management specialists.  
      The GOCC is one of the most sophisticated control centers in the transportation
industry, with state-of-the-art facilities, information systems, and communications, and proven plans and processes based on real-world contingency management experience and expertise. All day, every day, the GOCC team responds to and overcomes
challenges, including severe weather systems, flight delays, emergency maintenance events, and even natural disasters. The GOCC supervises and protects FedEx team members and assets while correcting situations that could impact mail delivery service
to the Postal Service.   

Figure 1-7.
FedEx s GOCC       Our Global Operations Control Center is state-of-the art in managing a large airline fleet traversing
the nation and the world.     

FedEx has the facilities, tools, processes, and staff to effectively respond to contingency situations. We were an
industry leader in collaborating with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in responding to the events of September 11, 2001 and the restoration of aviation support for the Postal Service. FedEx belongs to the Domestic Events Network
(DEN), which was established on the morning of September 11. DEN is a 24/7 unclassified interagency telephone conference   sponsored by the security arm of the FAA   dedicated to real-time coordination of air security issues.
     FedEx has a back-up center located in Collierville, TN, that operates the network in live mode every Monday so that this contingency control
center remains fully capable of assuming operational control of our global network in an emergency.

1.3.2 Facility Support and Administrative Functions    
  The goal of facility management at FedEx is to enable on-time delivery of Postal Service mail and all non-postal FedEx products. PTM ensures, through its
coordination with AGFS, that local facility support and administration functions are present at each airport local ramp, ensuring mail movement, hub support, scanning and data capture, billing support, communications, and other functions. The PTM
Department, described in Section 1.0, coordinates all necessary administrative and facility support at each of the FedEx ramp and hub locations throughout the network.      As an example, FedEx facility support includes on-site maintenance staff at each of our ramp and hub locations. We have more than [ * ] ground support and material handling equipment mechanics at
FedEx ramps and hubs across the country. We have a planned and executed preventive maintenance program and an equipment replacement plan and schedule to ensure that equipment is operational, capable, and available to support service delivery
requirements. We ensure that gate space for our aircraft, loading and surface handling equipment, scanning equipment, and other facility requirements as established in Section 1.3.8, are available.   
   1.3.3 Monitor Performance       The Postal
Service and FedEx have developed, over the years of joint operations, and will continue to provide a series of monitoring control points that provide a high degree of confidence for on-time and reliable mail delivery services. We will continue to
operate these control points. Performance is monitored by PTM through our well-established data capture capability that provides snapshots of our performance at 15-minute intervals, and is summarized to show our performance during the day and at the
end of day, end of week, and end of monthly operating periods. Sections 1.3.5, 1.3.10, and 1.3.15 further describe key points of data capture and distribution that provide performance monitoring input.   
  We have email distribution lists in place for the Day Network which include Postal Service local operators, FedEx local operators, and the area and
national headquarters personnel for both organizations. Emails of the Day Summaries contain the daily recap data and an attached Excel spreadsheet providing delay details and explanatory information. The reports are prepared in a.m. and p.m.
versions and are distributed by the Senior Operations Administrator in PTM with the departmental email ID: PTM_OPS@fedex.com.      We distribute a
Weekly Service Level Report Adjusted, Weekly Analysis Review presentation, and a Saturday Service Level Report to management in several organizations including PTM and Postal Service Air Transportation Operations. We list in Section 1.3.16
in this volume a number of reports that we prepare, including information about the intended audience, a brief description of each report, the distribution timeline, and report frequency.  Figure 1-8  lists some benefits of the FedEx
performance monitoring activities.       Figure 1-8. FedEx Performance Monitoring Benefits to the Postal Service

Monitoring of national weather daily from the FedEx Meteorological Department  
      
  Establishes the ability to adjust Day Network flight schedules, re-routing, and hub operations to maximize on-time delivery of mail   
     1.3.4 Provide Feedback to the Postal Service       FedEx has Operations Administrators who track performance daily. We provide updates on Postal Service transport parameters with regard to system performance throughout the day, with recaps at the end of
each operation. Thus, feedback to the Postal Service occurs on both a formal and informal basis, with our PTM informally discussing both normal and unusual operations with their counterparts in the Postal Service and formally through the documented
reports that we describe in Section 3.3.16.       1.3.5 Ensure the Integrity of Data Entry    
  FedEx has eliminated manual data entry to reduce keying errors. In addition, we perform root cause analysis for abnormalities discovered in the data. We
have developed a program that validates the accuracy of Dispatch and Routing (D R) numbers to eliminate duplicate entries. The Error Correction (EC) program searches D R tags that have been identified as not being billed because no container
has been assigned.      The EC program goes into the PSALMS EC website, does a screen scrape of the D Rs, and downloads them into an Excel
document. The program then downloads a Truck Dispatch Report (TDR) and Flight Dispatch Report (FDR) data base and a (Postal Service Alliance Leveraging Multiple Synergies) PSALMS billing file to search against. It takes the D R and does the
search to see if the unbilled D R tag can be found on the TDR/FDR to identify a container that it can be assigned to. If the D R is found, it is then compared to D Rs already billed that are located in the PSALMS billing file. If there
is a comparable D R found, then the D R is a duplicate and the D R is not billed again. If the D R is not found in the billing file, the container found is assigned and the D R is billed using that container.   
  If the D R is not found in the TDR/FDR database, the program goes into a master database to get the corresponding scans. If the scanned data reveals
a DECONS, the D R is deemed invalid and the D R is not billed. If there is no DECONS scan and there is a CONS scan, then the CONS number is recorded and is used by the program to go into FAMIS to do an additional search of TDR and FDR data.
If the program cannot find a container to assign the D R tag to, then it is noted as  Research Required  and the engineers do more research on the D R.      [ * ]       1.3.6 Coordinate the Exchange of Information    
  FedEx has a series of comprehensive daily, weekly, and monthly reports that coordinate information across the FedEx and Postal Service organizations.
FedEx will communicate daily with the Postal Service through electronic reports, using EDI 214, Version 4010, as well as face-to-face meetings with on-site ramp personnel.      Daily reports include: [ * ]      Weekly reports include: [ * ]

      Monthly meetings between the Postal Service, THS, and FedEx will continue to communicate all planned changes in aircraft, tender times,
and other operational issues. PTM Operations Administrators communicate mission-critical information via reporting and special alerts regarding sort-down times, actual and variance to plan, and inbound and outbound flight and truck exception
activity in and out of all hubs and major sort locations. They also communicate ad hoc and alternate move activity. Flight schedules and area operating plans identify changes to Postal Service headquarters, area offices, and the local operating
teams. FedEx and the Postal Service also hold local meetings at ramp locations to manage and correct local issues.       1.3.8 Correct Type and
Quantity of Equipment    

FedEx will continue to provide a Unit Load Device (ULD) matrix monthly, which lists the planned ULD
equipment by day and by week for the month. This information is in the Planning Matrix which will be sent to Postal Service headquarters, the THS operator, and the local Postal Service representative in each market.   
  FedEx also maintains spare aircraft, crews, ULDs, vehicles, and operating equipment which are strategically positioned to ensure on-time operations and
to ensure that we meet the Postal Service s operational requirements.  Figure 1-10  lists our ramp and ground equipment that is used to load, move, and manage all air cargo, including Postal Service mail.

1.3.9 Assist in Unloading or
Loading ULDs to or from Surface Transportation       FedEx will continue to assist in unloading or loading ULDs to and from all surface
transportation. FedEx has more than [ * ] ramp personnel across the network. FedEx personnel work with THS operators and subcontractors to ensure that the ULDs arriving at the origin or destination ramp are transferred to and from aircraft and
trucks expeditiously. We have accommodated this assistance requirement over our 12-year history with the Postal Service and our personnel comply with this requirement routinely to move the mail. Our local ramp managers and staff have solid working
relationships with the THS subcontractors at each ramp location, and those relationships operate to make the Postal Service processes work without interruption to ensure that we meet daily schedule demands.

1.3.10 Scan Material Handling Units (Required) or Postal MTE    
  FedEx performs scans on all handling units to ensure the chain of custody and accountability for all Postal Service handling units tendered to FedEx. All
handling units will be scanned consistent with our established best practices. FedEx will perform possession scans, load scans, hub sort scans, hub nest scans, and delivery scans. Scan data will be aggregated and transmitted via electronic EDI to
FedEx and Postal Service information technology systems. No scanning of Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) is required as FedEx is not performing the THS function.       1.3.11 Process Mail for Dispatch from the Aviation Supplier s Facility to the Postal Service Facility       Upon request from the Postal Service, FedEx will process mail for movement via aircraft, tug and dolly, containerized trucks, and bulk trucks as necessary, from our facility to the Postal Service
facility.      Day Sort Operations processes mail that arrives inbound to the hub from the field operations each day. This includes Priority Mail
(PML), Express Mail (EML), First Class Mail (FCM), and Registered Mail (RML). During the week, any EML that was tendered and labeled as day product will be processed by the Day Sort Operations. Any EML that is not scanning correctly will be taken
immediately to the Postal Service Re-Label Area. The Postal Service Re-Label Area has been given instructions on how to handle EML with distribution table problems.       1.3.12 Close-Out, Receive, and Dispatch All Surface Vehicles       FedEx will continue to work
closely with all THS providers to close out, receive, and dispatch all surface vehicles. Our streamlined approach will be managed by the FedEx ramp manager at each service point.

1.3.13 Handle Overflow Volumes per Postal Service General Directions    
  FedEx will continue to work closely with the THS and the Postal Service to accept overflow volumes of mail. Our ramp managers, in collaboration with
Postal Service managers, will make every effort to accept and process all overflow volumes when possible. FedEx ramp managers at service point locations will coordinate with Postal Service staff to identify overflow situations as early as possible,
develop solutions to handle the overflow volumes, and resolve the overflow situation quickly and effectively with zero to minimal impact on mail delivery service schedules.       1.3.14 Cooperate With All Aviation Suppliers in the Transportation Service Chain       At both
the PTM management level and the local ramp manager level, FedEx will cooperate with all suppliers in the transportation chain including air carriers, air cargo companies, airport staff, and THS service providers.   
  Areas of cooperation will include items such as sharing ground handling equipment when one party has equipment breakdowns, sharing joint-use ramps, and
working collaboratively to deal with contingency events or irregular operations that would endanger on-time performance.       1.3.15 Enter Data
Timely and Accurately       FedEx has developed a series of processes that depend on accurate and timely collection of data. The foundation for
quickly capturing data in a highly accurate manner is the electronic identification of cargo as it moves from its origin to its destination. Bar code scanning establishes the foundation for FedEx s near-100% accuracy and high speed of data
capture for fast-paced and time-sensitive processes ( Figure 1-11 ).      These data capture techniques and system updates allow customers to
determine the progress of their cargo from origin to destination. The accuracy of the data capture also allows the network performance reports to be prepared and submitted to the Postal Service. FedEx has been at the forefront of the industry in the
development of these rapid data capture technologies and has applied them to all processes in the Postal Service network.       1.3.16 Prepare
Required Reports       FedEx has prepared and submitted all required and requested reports over the life of the current Postal Service contract.
As requested by the Postal Service, FedEx will continue to provide these reports under the Air Cargo Network contract. Reports submitted under the current contract will be continued as is, or modified as required by the solicitation. These reports
include:      [ * ]      In addition to
these reports, FedEx will also provide new reports that are required to meet Postal Service requirements. In all reports, we will be diligent in providing accurate, timely information to enable Postal Service oversight and management of the ACN
contract.       1.3.16.1 Daily Mail Condition Report       [ * ]

  [ * ]       1.3.17 Perform Verification of
Security Seals on Surface Transportation       FedEx will continue to verify all security seals on surface transportation prior to leaving our
facility, as we have done since 2001. This will be a physical inspection of security seals on each trailer upon receipt by FedEx. The verification inspection will also be done prior to tendering the mail to the THS provider or Postal Service. The
FedEx ramp manager at each ramp will ensure that all security seals are verified and logged by ramp staff. The process involves verifying the integrity of the seal on the back of the trailer and noting it on the Truck Dispatch Report paperwork.
      1.3.18 Ensure the Security of All Mail       It is the mission of FedEx to protect and safeguard all mail from the time it is tendered to FedEx until the time FedEx tenders it to the THS or Postal Service. We accomplish this through a combination of
training of staff, physical protection of facilities, and scanning of mail up to nine times from tender to FedEx through tender to THS or Postal Service. We also run background checks on all employees, and we conduct drug screening to ensure we have
a drug-free workplace to decrease the likelihood of security incidents related to the mail while it is in our possession.      We provide initial
and annual refresher training on mail handling and on the importance of the security of the mail to all FedEx employees involved in the contract. We have physical protection capabilities at each ramp location including closed-circuit video
surveillance, facility access control, intrusion detection, and routine patrols by FedEx or local uniformed security staff. We maintain tight access control at all facilities to ensure that only authorized individuals are allowed into areas
processing mail. Individuals attempting to enter or exit a sorting facility must successfully clear established screening checkpoints. These checkpoints:       

Ensure that the employee/vendor has an active ID badge.      

Screen each employee/vendor for contraband through our x-ray and metal detecting devices.      

Ensure that all customer property remains in designated sorting areas.         Through this combination of security procedures, security equipment, trained FedEx employees, and uniformed security staff, FedEx provides a heightened level of security to protect mail while it is in our
possession.       1.4 Designation (Postal Service Performs Terminal Handling Service (THS)   Day Network)    
    
    During the term of the Transportation Agreement, processes were jointly developed by the Postal
Service and FedEx resulting in well-designed routines that enable critical schedules to be met.     
   For the ACN Day Network
contract, Fed Ex proposes that the Postal Service perform the THS operation.

efficient and effective coordination processes and procedures over our long relationship to expedite the delivery of mail. All FedEx employees, as they do today, will assist Postal Service employees in both the unloading of inbound surface vehicles
and the loading and dispatching of outbound surface vehicles. FedEx routinely transmits reports to the Postal Service (see Section 1.3.16 for report details) on mail delivery status and operational issues. Regularly scheduled meetings enable a
broader audience to discuss a wide range of topics, while daily communications focus on tactical issues such as extra volume and late tender. Daily interface between the Postal Service and FedEx occurs via email; phone; and face-to-face meetings
among PTM engineers and management, FedEx ramp managers, and local Postal Service contract and operations managers.       1.5.1 Delivery  
Day Network       FedEx will deliver mail to the Postal Service destination ramps on or before the latest delivery time in accordance with
Attachment 12, Tender and Delivery Time Commitment. Since FedEx will not be performing the THS operation, the Postal Service or THS contractors will unload the mail from the ULDs received, scan it, and separate it according to Attachment 5,
Separations, and then transfer it to Postal Service supplied MTE.      A daily FedEx matrix plan will be distributed to hubs and ramps, which will
track changes in volumes and available lift, so that FedEx will be able to accommodate any increases in volume.       1.5.2 Delivery  
Night Network       Not applicable to Day Network.       1.5.3 Saturday Delivery   Day Network       FedEx will deliver mail according to specifics
of mail tendered on Saturday, as outlined in Attachment 3, Operating Plan, Day Network. All destinations are air destinations (service points served by aircraft) unless identified in Attachment 12 as surface destinations (service points served by
truck).       1.6 Boarding Priority    
    
    FedEx will adhere to Postal Service boarding priorities as we have done successfully on the
Transportation Agreement since 2001.     
   In accordance with Postal Service priorities, FedEx will adhere to the boarding priority
described in the following sections.       1.6.1 Boarding Priority   Day Network    
  FedEx will load accepted mail in the following boarding preference order, as specified by the Postal Service.   

1.  
  Registered (CON-CON) Mail         

3.  
  Perishables

7.  
  All other mail        Any repossession of mail by the
Postal Service without exercising the rights outlined in this RFP under Repossession of Mail by the Postal Service will be determined by the Postal Service designee, depending on circumstances.   
   1.6.2 Boarding Priority   Night Network       Not applicable to Day Network.       1.7 Frequency    
    
    FedEx will provide aviation supplier support to meet all Postal Service frequency of service
requirements     
   The frequency of service for the Day Network is based on 6 days of Postal Service delivery, Tuesday through
Sunday. This provides approximately 307 operating days annually (308 in a leap year). Holidays excluded are discussed in Section 1.14.4 of this proposal.       1.8 Mail Assignment and Transport   Day Network    
    
    Mail assignment and transport, the heart of the current Transportation Agreement, will also be the
core of the new ACN contract and will continue to be a focus for feedback and improvement.     
   FedEx will prepare and deliver
flight schedules to the Postal Service at least 30 days in advance of the first day of the operating period. These schedules are developed by PTM and are part of the Network Operating Plan as operational documents that convert the plan into action.
After receipt of flight schedules, the Postal Service will create dispatch routing instructions based on FedEx flight schedules that subsequently are shown on the Postal Service D R tag.      Mail Assignment and Transport Process   Day Network defines how the Postal Service will give FedEx tendered mail and illustrates the steps required in the planning process for assignment and
transport, as shown in  Figure 1-12 .  All Mail Due FedEx Time  is outlined in Attachment 12 and is the time that the last piece of mail tendered must be in FedEx s hands.   

Figure 1-12. Mail Assignment and Transport Process    
   This process, jointly developed by the Postal Service and FedEx, facilitates on-time delivery.

1.10 Aviation Provider Planned Accommodation   Day Network    

With the largest air cargo fleet in the world, FedEx is better able to
absorb changes in Postal Service volumes and can provide greater flexibility to the Postal Service than any other air cargo carrier.      
    FedEx will guarantee up to 105% of the planned capacity in the Day Network for each origin daily. Should tendered mail
exceed 105% of planned capacity, FedEx has the option to refuse the excess; however, throughout the current relationship, FedEx frequently has handled volumes tendered by the Postal Service exceeding its guarantee. Such flexibility is part of our
commitment to providing the most dependable, reliable, and customer-focused service to the Postal Service.       1.11 Aviation Provider Planned
Accommodation   Night Network       Not applicable to Day Network.       1.12 Treatment of Exceptional Types of Mail        

Over the past 6 years, FedEx has integrated the special handling
requirements associated with the increasing amounts of exceptional types of mail into our normal daily operations.      
    Since 2006, the volume of exceptional mail types, including lives, perishables, and HAZMAT, has increased continuously.
FedEx provides rigorous training in the handling of exceptional types of mail as part of the training for new employees and annual refresher training.       1.12.1 Treatment of Live Mail       For live mail handling, FedEx will continue to use a
multi-step process that covers all aspects of receipt, verification of live mail viability, inspection, scanning, loading, and unloading of both perishable and live mail. The FedEx guidelines include all requirements outlined in the Postal Service
Domestic Mail Manual 601, Subsection 9.3.      Prior to contract award, as specified in the Statement of Work, FedEx and the Postal Service
will negotiate an attachment that lays out the specifics of transportation of perishable and live mail. Because FedEx has been handling these exceptional types of mail for six years, we expect minimal issues.   
   1.12.2 Treatment of Perishables    
  Perishable mail is treated in the same manner as that described in Section 1.12.1.       1.12.3 Treatment of Registered Mail       To accurately track each piece of Registered Mail,
FedEx will provide the Postal Service with the following information:       

Aircraft number          

Aircraft compartment location          

Actual flight departure time          

Any accident or irregularities          

D R tags indicating final destination air stop.         FedEx will send an email alerting the Postal Service of Registered Mail that has failed to make its planned dispatch; we will then await instructions from the Postal Service.

1.12.4 Treatment of Hazardous Material (HAZMAT)    
  FedEx follows and will continue to follow all applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, OSHA and FAA rules
and regulations in the handling of HAZMAT. We provide extensive training to certify Dangerous Goods Specialists to ensure that all Postal Service HAZMAT will be handled in accordance with regulatory requirements. FedEx personnel take annual
refresher training on the handling of HAZMAT, which means that all FedEx personnel have up-to-date information on any changes to procedures or policies as well as the review of current procedures. FedEx will comply with all Postal Service
requirements for the tagging and treatment of HAZMAT as follows:       

Tagging of hazardous materials          

ORM-D Air  is for air and surface transport;  ORM-D  is for surface transport only.      

Division Class 6.2  is permitted only for medical/veterinary use, research or laboratory certification for public health. The shipper must pack
these goods to withstand shocks, pressure changes, and other handling conditions.          

Division Class 9  is for miscellaneous materials presenting hazards during transport (solid dry ice, elevated temperature substances,
environmentally hazardous substances, lifesaving appliances, and asbestos).          

Hazardous and Dangerous Goods and all other hazardous material.      

Assignment of hazardous materials          

Must be tendered at least 2 hours prior to final tender time of flight.      

There is no surcharge.          

Manifest copy and items must be handed to a FedEx representative 2 hours prior to closeout time of flight.      

Verification of postal manifest includes checking the number of pieces, weight, inclusion of appropriate shipper s certification in aircraft load
manifest, and completeness of pilot notification paperwork.          

Documentation of refusal to handle HAZMAT includes name, address of mailer and FedEx location, type and amount of HAZMAT, and reason for refusal.

Procedures for HAZMAT spills, releases, incidents, and emergencies. In the 12 years that FedEx has worked with the Postal Service, there have been NO
exceptions to these procedures:          

While the HAZMAT is in the possession of FedEx, but not onboard aircraft, damaged HAZMAT items must not be loaded.      

For items causing injury, illness, significant property damage, or disruption of operations, FedEx will complete PS Form 1770 and submit to the Postal
Service.          

If there is an incident while onboard aircraft, FedEx must complete DOT Form F 5800.1. Within 24 hours, a copy of the form must be sent to the COR.
Such incidents include HAZMAT cargo spills that come into contact with mail.          1.13 Offshore Capacity Requirement  
Day Network        

FedEx staffed ramps at all required offshore airports enables us to meet
all offshore capacity requirements from Day One of the contract.      
    Capacity to handle the mail volume is critical within the continental United States, but capacity for offshore deliveries
to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands is equally critical. FedEx has, and will continue to provide, at a minimum, the daily volumes required in the solicitation, shown in  Figure 1-13 .

    Mail destined for St. Thomas and St. Croix, Virgin Islands, is handled through San Juan, Puerto Rico. FedEx will
accommodate any increase in capacity through the planning process and by mutual agreement with the Postal Service.       1.14 Volume Commitment
  General Information        

Throughout the 12-year Transportation Agreement relationship, FedEx has
generally had sufficient capacity to handle whatever volume the Postal Service required.      
    FedEx will continue our 12-year record of successfully supporting the Postal Service s dynamic volume requirements
and of meeting service level agreements (SLAs) for aviation services. Our knowledge and understanding of the Postal Service mission, operations, culture, and technology provides a non-disruptive, no-risk option for the Postal Service   no
learning curve, no initial training for existing employees, no changes in processes. Essentially, all activities will continue in the manner that the Postal Service has enjoyed since the beginning of the strategic alliance with FedEx.   
  FedEx has the fleet, pilots, facilities, and support staff   including [ * ] A P-certified aircraft mechanics   to immediately
support future Postal Service volume schedules and forecasts. From Day 1 of the new contract, FedEx can handle any Postal Service volume based on historical volumes. A one-day sample from a peak week in December 2011 that clearly shows our ability
to support Postal Service volume schedules and forecasts is shown in  Figure 1-14 .       Figure 1-14. Daily Volume
Commitment versus Actual Volume        FedEx has the capacity in its fleet to support any practical volume that the Postal
Service can request, as evidenced by this December example from 2011.

  FedEx has the capacity and capabilities to meet the minimum contract volume of [ * ] cubic feet per operational day. The volume is estimated by
averaging the actual (or anticipated) volume per operational day across the 6-day operating period.       1.14.2 Operating Period Volume Minimum
  Day Network       FedEx understands and agrees with the volume minimums for the Day Network with the Postal Service performing all THS
operations.       1.14.3 Aviation Supplier Performs THS Operation       The Postal Service will perform THS operations for the Day Network.

Network.       1.15 Operating Periods       FedEx will plan and operate the Day Network in accordance with Attachment 1, Postal Service Operating Periods. Because FedEx has been providing services for 12 years based on Transportation Agreement
operating periods very similar to those specified in Attachment 1, the transition to the new contract will be virtually risk-free and indistinguishable to the Postal Service. FedEx will provide to the Postal Service our monthly operating plan
30 days before the beginning of the operating period, and will specify the specific type of airline ULD per origin/destination, destination of airline ULD   direct (bypass), and destination of airline ULD   mixed (to be sorted at
hub).       1.16 Ordering Process   Introduction        

FedEx will use the proven ordering process used successfully under the
current Transportation Agreement to meet Postal Service peak and non-peak volume requirements.      
    The Postal Service process for ordering air transportation for mail to and from destinations in the contiguous 48 states
and Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands is provided at Day 120 for non-peak periods and Day 150 for peak periods.      Because the
current ordering process is very similar to that outlined in the ACN statement of work (SOW), FedEx has already demonstrated the ability to work within the specified timeframes. Careful planning means that mail tendered to FedEx will arrive on time
at the proper service point, thus maintaining the Postal Service s historical record for quality service.

1.16.1 Ordering Process   Non-Peak   Day Network    
  The non-peak Day Network ordering process will begin with the Postal Service providing FedEx a request for mail volumes that delineates each lane pair
(origin and destination) based on separate plans for Tuesday/Wednesday, Thursday/Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Volumes by lane pair will be specified in cubic feet.  Figure 1-16  provides further details of this process.   

Figure 1-16. Ordering Process   Non-Peak Day Network    
   Detailed planning and coordination with the Postal Service ensures that FedEx will meet contract delivery schedules and volumes.
      FedEx and the Postal Service agree on the delivery mechanism of orders and responses. For bypass containers allocated in lanes with 110%
capacity of ULD configuration for planned aircraft, the Postal Service and FedEx will agree, during the planning process, that bypass and mixed containers will be built at origin service points.   
   1.16.2 Ordering Process   Non-Peak   Night Network       Not applicable to Day Network.       1.16.3 Ordering Process   Peak   Day Network
      The 4 or 5 weeks that make up each peak operating period include Christmas week so that the requested volume capacity is sufficient to
meet Postal Service volume requirements for holiday mail delivery. Both non-peak and peak volume forecasting specify individual origin and destination lane pairs and are expressed in cubic feet.  Figure 1-17  provides further details of this
process.

1.17 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Including Scanning and Data Transmission    

FedEx has the infrastructure and experience with EDI to provide the Postal
Service with a low-risk solution for rapid transmission of high-volume data streams.      
    FedEx will transmit and receive status and operational data according to the EDI standards as required in the
solicitation, Attachment 7, Electronic Data Interchange Service Requirements. Additionally, we will transmit payment information using the Attachment 7 standards for financial data. We will use the standards shown in  Figure 1-18
 for transactions of volume and relevant scans with the Postal Service.       Figure 1-18. Postal Service Accepted EDI
Standards for Scanning and Data Transmissions        FedEx will use these EDI standards for status and operational data as well
as for payment information transmission with the Postal Service.        

Standard    
      
     Purpose     

CARDIT   
      
  To convey detailed information about domestic shipments.   

RESDIT   
      
  To receive status information at the handling unit level for domestic mail shipments.   

INVOIC ADV   
      
  Message claiming payment for goods and services supplied under agreed-upon conditions; also serves as specification for Debit Note and Credit Note messages. Postal Service
implementation is to provide invoice advice to its transport providers of the items, which comprise amounts payable for transportation services.   

CLAIMS   
      
  Message claiming payment for goods and services supplied under agreed-upon conditions; also serves as specification for Debit Note and Credit Note messages. Postal Service
implementation is to provide mechanism for its transport providers to report claims for the mail handling items which comprise amounts payable for transportation services.   
    EDI based on the UN/EDIFACT format is ideal technology for the high volume of transactions that will
be processed, based on contract requirements. FedEx owns the world s largest private digitized, value-added network (VAN) for business-to-business data exchange, FedExNet     , which allows us to easily accommodate large data streams. We have successfully used the FedExNet      VAN for the Postal Service since 2001 to transmit and receive operational and status data, as well as payment data. We are very familiar with the Attachment 7 EDI
requirements and standards, as we have used CARDIT and RESDIT protocols extensively since 2005 for international postal customers.      The status and operational data, as well as payment data, will be transmitted over the VAN as shown in  Figure 1-19 . Primary files on the FedEx side reside in the Scanning Database, which
stores and transmits scans and service files (shown as SRS, Summary Reporting System) and the PSALMS Revenue Database, which stores invoice and reconciliation files (shown as REV). With EDI, the Postal Service will receive the invoice and
reconciliation data from FedEx via a secure mailbox on FedExNet     .

Scanning and Data Transmission       FedEx will perform all scans in accordance with the solicitation scan requirements. A summary of the scans that we will perform is provided in Section 1.19. We will transmit the required data
elements within 2 hours of a reportable event. Available data will be transmitted at 15 minute intervals in the appropriate EDI format.   
   1.17.1 Surface Visibility Scanning    
  Since the Postal Service will perform THS, surface visibility scans will continue to be performed by the THS providers.   
   1.18 Reports (See Section 1.3.16)        

FedEx will continue to provide all required and requested reports over the
life of the ACN contract.      
    In Section 1.3.16 of this volume, we list the RFP-required reports and other, suggested reports that are useful for
monitoring performance on this contract and that provide input for future volume and schedule planning.       1.19 Performance Requirements and
Measurement

  Reductions in transportation payment for handling units delivered late are shown in  Figure 1-21.    
   Figure 1-21. Parameters for Reduction of Payment        FedEx fully accepts the requirements as stated in the solicitation.        

Quarterly performance reviews with the Postal Service will provide
visibility of contract performance and will improve and enhance communications between the Postal Service and FedEx.      
    FedEx will meet with the Postal Service every quarter, at a minimum, to discuss performance management as stated in the
solicitation. FedEx will submit a list of potential topics for Postal Service consideration and a list of FedEx personnel planning to attend. The minutes of the meeting will be shared between the parties. The following items will be included on the

Payment Processing   Day Network   Per Cube          1.22.1 Rates and Payment General       The basis of all rates and payments is the scans,
beginning with the possession/load scan and ending with the delivery scan at the completion of the FedEx delivery to the Postal Service. FedEx understands that if the delivery scan is not submitted or is not at the correct location, there will be no
payment. FedEx team members take great care in handling our customers  packages. Postal Service shipments enter our sorting system at specific times, are scanned, and then secured in the appropriate containers, trailers, or aircraft.
     The FedEx payment process includes electronic remittance advice and electronic funds transfer (EFT) to reduce much of the cost and paperwork
involved in issuing payments. Both of these tools reduce check processing costs, while ensuring quick and accurate application of payment. Remittance advice file processing is automatically included with the EDI invoices.   
    1.22.1.1 Scan Requirements        FedEx
will comply with all scanning and data transmission requirements as stated in the solicitation. FedEx leads the transportation industry in scanning and tracking technology. Packages are scanned during our pickup, sort, and delivery processes by
handlers and by automated overhead scanners and scanning systems. Scanning enables FedEx and the Postal Service to observe the movement of packages electronically from pickup to delivery for an added level of security and end-to-end tracking of the
mail. Using a variety of wireless data collection devices such as PScan and PowerPad as shown in  Figure 1-22 , we scan D R tags at each hand-off point, capturing a variety of shipment information, including:   

Dispatch and routing number  
          Origin/destination
location information      
      Ship date   
     
        Exception scans  
          Type of

    1.22.1.2 Night Turn Scan Requirements        Not applicable to Day Network.        1.22.1.3 Day Turn Scan Requirements     
  FedEx will comply with all day turn scan requirements as presented in Section 1.19. FedEx will provide scans to allow end-to-end tracking of the
mail.       1.22.2 Payment Processing   Day Network   Per Cube         1.22.2.1 Invoicing        FedEx will comply with the solicitation requirements for
invoicing and payment for the Day Network. Payment will be based on handling units and ULDs (in cubic feet) and completion of scans for the required operating periods. We will include additional charges not covered in the automated payments system
in our monthly invoices. We will produce a weekly invoice based on a service week that begins at 0000 hours Saturday and ends at 2359 on Friday. We will submit the invoice by noon on Wednesday in order to receive payment by Wednesday, 3 weeks
following the receipt of the invoice.        1.22.2.2 Mail Tendered in ULDs        FedEx will comply with the conditions and solicitation requirements for Mail Tendered in ULDs.   
    1.22.2.3 Mail Tendered from Surface Trucks        FedEx will comply with the conditions and solicitation requirements for Mail Tendered from Surface Trucks.        1.22.2.4 Mail Tendered from Ad Hoc Trucks into the Aviation Supplier Hub        FedEx
accepts the conditions and will comply with the solicitation requirements for Mail Tendered from Ad Hoc Trucks into the Aviation Supplier Hub.   
    1.22.2.5 Aviation Supplier Surface Transportation   Not Included in Transportation Payment     
  When the Postal Service requires unplanned surface transportation of mail, we will include a separate rate per mile for highway transportation as included
in Attachment 10, Pricing. We will comply with the conditions and solicitation requirements for Aviation Supplier Surface Transportation   Not Included in Transportation Payment.

1.22.2.6 Economic Adjustment        FedEx will comply with all requirements in the solicitation section on Economic Adjustment. Only the non-fuel line haul rate will be economically adjusted. We will use the economic adjustments in
Attachment 10, Pricing.        1.22.2.7 Hub Sort Scan        FedEx will comply with all requirements in the solicitation on providing Hub Sort Scan at the appropriate hubs as part of our normal process. We agree that the Postal Service will pay for hub sort only
where the sorts are supported by EDI scan information.        1.22.2.8 Re-Labeling Charge     
  FedEx will comply with all requirements and accepts all statements in the solicitation for this section. FedEx understands that the Postal Service will
pay an additional charge for replacing a D R tag that is missing or becomes illegible. The Postal Service will provide equipment to FedEx to perform this function.      Re-labeling is an example of our commitment to the Postal Service. In 2002, the Postal Service approached FedEx, requesting that we take over the re-labeling function at the Memphis hub. From the time
that we assumed responsibility for this area, most, if not all pieces, move out the same day that they arrive at the sort. FedEx re-labels approximately [ * ] pieces per day on a non-contingency day. Approximately [ * ] times per month the Postal
Service declares a contingency (meaning its SAMS equipment is down in the local market) and the unlabeled handling units are sent to the Memphis hub, where FedEx labels the mail. In these situations, we label between [ * ] and [ * ] handling units
of mail and introduce them back into the network, thereby allowing the Postal Service to accomplish mail delivery service to its customers.   
    1.22.2.9 Fuel Adjustment        FedEx
agrees that the Postal Service will make a monthly fuel adjustment to the fuel line haul rate in accordance with the solicitation section on Fuel Adjustment.       1.22.3 Payment Processing   Day Network   Per Pound       FedEx will provide service
paid by the cube for the Day Network, so this optional service will not be provided.       1.22.4 Payment Processing   Night Network  
Per Pound       Not applicable to Day Network.        1.22.4.1 Invoicing        Not applicable to Day Network.

1.23 Reconciliation Process    

FedEx will work collaboratively with the Postal Service to reconcile and
resolve all payment issues as expeditiously as possible.      
    FedEx will comply with the requirements in the solicitation section entitled Reconciliation Process. The Postal Service
Revenue Team and the FedEx Revenue Team have worked together since 2001 to refine many different reconciliation items. Through constant diligence in monitoring the revenue stream for anomalies, we have collaboratively developed the current
reconciliation process. With this knowledge and experience with the Postal Service reconciliation process, FedEx will continue to review and refine the reconciliation process to support the Postal Service s reconciliation requirements and
process on the ACN contract.       1.24 Mode of Transportation to Service Each Air Stop   (Mail Assignment and Transport) as Identified in
Tender and Delivery Specifications Listed in Attachment 3 and Attachment 4        

As one of the most reliable, dependable, and largest air cargo carriers in
the world, with a record of successfully supporting the Postal Service since 2001, we will be able to provide all modes of transportation to service each air stop on Day 1 of the ACN contract.      
    The mode of transportation to service each air stop will be provided in the Monthly Operating Plan, which provides the
details for each operating period. We will tailor our plans, including modes of transportation, to Postal Service needs. In general, for the Day Network (Tuesday through Sunday, excluding Saturday), we use aircraft. On Saturday, we use a combination
of air and truck transport. We provide here an overview of our aircraft and truck fleet.      The FedEx Express aircraft fleet is shown in
 Figure 1-22 . In addition, FedEx has on-call arrangements to lease additional aircraft to handle peak volume and other contingencies.       Figure 1-22. FedEx Express Aircraft Fleet        FedEx has ample capacity to
service each air stop.

  Maximum Operational revenue payload is the lesser of the net volume-limited payload and the net maximum structural payload.     

2  
  This aircraft model will be introduced in 2013 and is included here to show the contribution over the life of the contract.     
  In addition to our aircraft, FedEx Express operates approximately 52,400 ground transport vehicles, including pickup and delivery vans, larger trucks
called container transport vehicles, and over-the-road tractors and trailers. These vehicles are strategically located at service points across the network to support volumes and service delivery requirements and are repositioned to meet mail
service delivery schedules.       1.25 Other Components of the Statement of Work Not Previously Discussed    
  This section presents components of this solicitation which are not discussed earlier or are referenced in Volume 1. We have added this subsection for
easier cross-reference.       1.25.1 Service Points       FedEx currently serves all locations in the Day Network via our extensive U.S. network using three air cargo hubs. Beginning on Day 1, FedEx can furnish all services to all locations specified in the
solicitation in Attachment 3. Because we are the world s largest air cargo carrier and have successfully performed on this contract for the last 12 years, we are uniquely qualified to provide uninterrupted service to the Postal Service through
our infrastructure, support facilities, and continuity of staff.       1.25.2 Management Plan    
  Our Management Plan details are fully presented in Volume 1, Section 3.0. Since the solicitation calls for a full response for all SOW elements, we
have added this reference to facilitate evaluation and use during the contract period.       1.25.3 Repossession of Mail by the Postal Service
      FedEx will fully comply with the solicitation requirement to provide repossession of mail by the Postal Service in the event that the
Postal Service requires mail to be returned. We will actively work with local Postal Service agents or representatives to expeditiously return the mail.       1.25.4 Local Agreements       In accordance with the solicitation, no local agreements, informal
agreements, or working agreements made without appropriate binding authority will bind or obligate the Postal Service or FedEx.       1.25.5
Operating Periods       The FedEx response fully addresses all activities in the operating periods, including planning, transport operations,
and payments. We will offer the full range of services throughout the entire life of the contract.

  In addition to the contingency conditions addressed in Section 2 of this proposal, FedEx knows that there are a multitude of additional situations,
from snow to volcanoes to typhoons, that have the potential to impact our aviation network and our support for the Postal Service. In all cases, GOCC, in close collaboration with PTM, anticipates contingency events, assesses possible impacts,
tailors and implements contingency plans, performs all required actions, and manages the contingency situation through to closure. FedEx s primary objective in dealing with contingencies is to ensure that we continue to provide all required
mail delivery services according to Postal Service contract schedules.       2.9 Training of Employees on Contingency Plan    
  Contingencies, from blizzards to hurricanes to floods, are a way of life for FedEx employees. Our staff has to be prepared at any given moment to respond
to contingencies, implement proven plans, and continue service to our customers. Our employees, from the GOCC contingency planners and managers, to the PTM management team, to the ramp staff at each FedEx airport location, are trained to deal with
events and circumstances beyond their immediate control. FedEx employees receive initial and annual recurrence training for contingency plans and response actions for each FedEx airport location. They receive additional training when contingency
plans are revised or local procedures are updated. Training records are maintained in employee personnel files and include training received, test scores, and certifications

1.0 Night Network Operating Plan    

FedEx, which has the world s largest cargo aircraft fleet, will build upon our 12 years of
successful support of the United States Postal Service to meet its Air Cargo Network requirements for mail delivery with consistently reliable and dependable service.     
    FedEx will provide a Postal Service Night Network that will deliver all air transportation and ancillary services to all
required service points identified by the Postal Service in the Air Cargo Network (ACN) solicitation from Day 1 of the contract. We possess the immediate capacity to provide this service five days per week at the historical non-peak and peak volume
levels identified in Attachment 2, Air Stops   Projected Volumes of the solicitation. As illustrated in  Figure 1-1 , this network includes all 146 required NIght Network service points and 5 FedEx hubs.   

Figure 1-1. FedEx Air Cargo Night Network    
   FedEx understands the Postal Service culture, processes, routing, and tender 
requirements better than any other        air freight company.    
   Single Vendor Network Benefits       Use of a
single carrier will provide the Postal Service with needed efficiencies and cost savings. In a multiple-carrier environment, capacity is deployed less efficiently, adding cost and additional handling unnecessarily. For example, if a late Postal
Service shipment on the day network misses the tender time, the Postal Service would have the option of directing the single carrier to move the product on the night network and enable the mail to be delivered to Postal customers on time. With
multiple carriers, the costs of monitoring and coordinating activities would increase for the Postal Service. Policies and procedures for the carriers would inevitably differ, creating opportunities for errors, confusion, and potential delay of mail
delivery.

1     

FedEx and the Postal Service have established and will maintain a shared aviation network that has
enabled the Postal Service to significantly improve the service provided to its customers while continuously reducing the cost. For the past 12 years, FedEx, as the majority carrier, has transported Express, Priority, and First Class mail to and
from all of the points covered in this solicitation. Since 2006, we have also carried HAZMAT, live, perishable, and registered mail. As the largest carrier for the Postal Service, FedEx has provided this service at historical volume levels through
peak days of more than [ * ] to low-volume days covering non-widely observed holidays.      FedEx has been a collaborative business partner with
the Postal Service for the past 12 years, and has been extremely responsive to requests for increasing volume, expanding service coverage, adding new products with unique handling characteristics, and maintaining cost controls. We believe that a
single-provider network, with its operating efficiencies, extensive network connections, service capabilities and lower cost structure, will provide the greatest long-term benefits for the Postal Service, particularly at a time of fiscal need and
budget awareness across the nation. FedEx has the aircraft, equipment, capacity, network reach, and management capability to continue serving the Postal Service in an efficient and low-cost, single-vendor operation well into the future.   
  The ongoing strategic alliance between FedEx and the Postal Service under the Postal Service Transportation Agreement (Transportation Agreement) brings
noteworthy advantages to a renewal contract for the ACN. The Postal Service and FedEx jointly developed many of the processes and procedures that are currently being employed in the Transportation Agreement network. No other air cargo carrier has
the benefit of this long and efficient operational experience with the Postal Service. FedEx has worked with the Postal Service to optimize schedules and tender times, eliminate excessive cost, and increase efficiencies, as shown in  Figure
1-2 .

Figure 1-2. FedEx Key Differentiators    
   FedEx has a number of key differentiators for operation of the Postal Service Air Cargo Network.    

FedEx Key Services    
      
     Differentiators     

Air Cargo Network:  FedEx has the world s largest cargo aircraft fleet to meet the Postal Service s aviation requirements with reliable and dependable
service.  
      
          With more than 634 aircraft, FedEx has the world s
largest fleet of cargo aircraft.      
        We are the only company with proven experience supporting requirements of
size, scope, and scale of the Postal Service ACN procurement.               FedEx is the only aviation supplier with staffed operating bases at all ACN Night Network airports.  
            FedEx is
the only aviation supplier to the Postal Service that operates 24/7 with no exclusion for holiday surge and weekend support.      
        Our ISO 9001:2008 Certification was renewed for 2012.  
            The
FedEx fleet includes more than [ * ] trunk and more than [ * ] feeder spare aircraft that are strategically placed throughout North America to protect service.    

Management:  FedEx possesses the skill, financial depth, and management tools required to engage and deliver on cost, schedule, and performance expectations.  
      
          FedEx uses our Quality Driven Management (QDM) approach and
methods are built on the proven premise that higher quality lowers costs, improves service levels, and enhances the customer experience.      
        Over time, QDM has contributed to FedEx being the 6th most admired company on
Fortune s World s Most Admired Companies list and No. 7 on the Reputation Institute s list of socially responsible firms in the United States.      
        FedEx s leading edge technologies (scanning, data transmission, and
communications) will deliver superior aviation support to the Postal Service.               FedEx was the first-ever service company to win the Malcolm Baldrige Quality award, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to service quality.    

Past Performance:  FedEx has operated with the Postal Service for 12 years.  
      
          We have successfully met Service Level Requirements for the
Postal Service throughout our 12-year service history, as shown in  Figure 1-3 .          

Transition:  An award to FedEx ensures the Postal Service a no-risk, no-cost contract transition.  
      
          Our knowledge and understanding of the Postal Service mission, operations, culture, and
technology, and our business partner approach means a non-disruptive, no-risk transition to the ACN contract.    

Innovation and Investment:  FedEx is an innovation leader in air cargo logistics.  
      
          FedEx is ahead of plan to increase the fuel efficiency of
our pickup and delivery fleet by 20% between 2005 and 2020.               In FY12, approximately half of our $4 billion in capital expenditures is related to modernizing our air fleet.  
            FedEx
and the Postal Service invented the Transportation Agreement network design, significantly improving the performance and reducing the cost of the air transport service, proving that our vendor-customer team excels in innovative
practices.    

[ * ]    
     On-Time Delivery for the Postal Service       FedEx has achieved service levels outlined in the Transportation Agreement in alliance with the Postal Service since 2001. Throughout that time, our extensive cargo Night Network transport system has
demonstrated our capacity and capability to handle the historical volumes required by the Postal Service on weekdays during non-peak and peak periods. FedEx has delivered high-quality services that have consistently met or exceeded Postal Service
mail delivery service requirements as shown in  Figure 1-3 .      Each of the FedEx Night Network airports across the nation is currently
staffed with all necessary personnel to manage the receipt, outbound loading, and inbound delivery of Postal Service cargo. FedEx accomplishes this through an advanced hub-and-spoke system that ensures meeting delivery time requirements in all 146
ramp locations. FedEx is the only air cargo carrier that serves all 146 Postal Service locations and, as we have stated, FedEx has the world s largest air cargo fleet with 634 aircraft

serving airports in more than 220 countries and territories in all regions of the world. We can provide the capacity the Postal Service has outlined in Attachment 2 when and where it is needed
without relying on availability of commercial, wet lease, or dry lease aircraft. In addition, FedEx is continuously upgrading our fleet to offer needed capacities more efficiently and economically.   
   Program and Operational Support for the Postal Service       The FedEx Postal Transportation Management Department (PTM), as described in Volume 1, Section 2.5, has been in place since the inception of the contract relationship in 2001 and is a dedicated
Program Management Office (PMO) whose single mission is service to the Postal Service. FedEx Managing Director Ron Stevens has directed this department since the inception of the FedEx Postal Service strategic alliance. This department was
created as the interface for the Postal Service and designed to be a one-stop shop for all things Postal. Regardless of the issue, the Postal Service communicates with a single department. We recruited the best engineers in the country from our Air,
Ground and Freight Services (AGFS) Division; they are knowledgeable in both ramp and hub operations and the planning process to support the Postal Service. These engineers, who are strategically domiciled around the country and aligned with the
Postal Service Areas, work daily with the Postal Service on tactical issues affecting service. They work with Global Network Planning (GNP) and the Global Operations Control Center (GOCC) on issues regarding additional lift requirements as required.
The PTM engineers also work closely with local management on all operational issues. When an exception occurs, the PTM engineers develop a corrective action and communicate it to the Postal Service in the local, area, and headquarters groups.
     The engineers are also responsible for developing and communicating the processes for any changes. The group has two dedicated engineers
responsible for building the planning matrix each month. They work closely with the Postal Service planners on the volume request for each schedule period and act as a secondary check on lane-level volume from one operating period to the next. PTM
also has a dedicated Service Assurance Manager and two Operations Administrators. They provide reports and status updates throughout the day on flight and sort activity as well as issues that may impact service, such as contingency plans for weather
events e.g. hurricanes and winter storms. The PTM team has experienced little turnover within the group since its inception. We feel this consistency in leadership at the management and engineer level has contributed to on-going success of this
alliance.      PTM coordinates with the FedEx AGFS Division, which operates the air cargo network, and with GNP and GOCC that plan and manage
flight operations, including the movement of Postal Service mail. AGFS operates the cargo system through its main Memphis World Hub and through four subordinate organizations that operate FedEx ramps at airports within their respective regions.
     PTM coordinates with AGFS headquarters in Memphis, TN, and with the field ramp location managers. AGFS has an extensive management team to
oversee the actual flight and logistics operations as illustrated in  Figure 1-4 . This figure shows the customer-focused FedEx team supporting the Postal Service, leveraging the capabilities of AGFS, and managed by ramp managers at each
service point to deliver mail. PTM also coordinates with GNP and GOCC for Postal Service mail scheduling as well as flight operations for the Night Network.

Figure 1-4. Customer-Focused FedEx Mail Service Delivery Team    
   PTM coordinates with FedEx s AGFS, which operates the air cargo network and, with GNP and GOCC that plan and manage flight
operations, including the movement of Postal Service mail       PTM is the focal point for the Postal Service for planning and managing
delivery services, which are carried out by AGFS and the ramp managers and staff at each service point. This coordination involves managing freight volumes requested by the Postal Service, planning each monthly operating period, and daily
operational activity such as loading and launching aircraft, receiving, and tendering freight to the Postal Service at the destination. Also critical to movement of Postal Service mail is the GOCC, as it operates the aviation services that move the
mail.      Packages are scanned and the scan data is transmitted to system collection points constantly as they move through the system. This
allows comprehensive reporting of results of each day s activity. PTM, GNP, and AGFS work together using well-defined and comprehensive communication channels. Operating the most sophisticated air cargo network in the world requires immediate
communication, the ability to modify logistics operations swiftly and accurately, and total command of an exceptionally large fleet of aircraft. This is a complex management task, performed by demanding, outstanding, and talented professionals.
      1.1 Tender and Delivery Times by Air Stop        

FedEx is the only aviation supplier with staffed operating bases at all ACN Night Network
airports.     
    Specific tender and delivery times by air stop, including number and type of aircraft, are listed in Attachment 12,
Tender and Delivery Time Commitment. FedEx has an exemplary record over its 12-year history on the job. FedEx has consistently met or exceeded the tender time delivery requirement as shown in  Figure 1-3 . Even during our most challenging
operating period in December, with volume surges at twice our non-peak demand and extreme weather, FedEx still met the Postal Service on-time delivery requirement.

1.2 Operational Components of the SOW    

FedEx has consistently met service level requirements for the Postal Service throughout our 12-year
service history.     
    Throughout our 12-year alliance with the Postal Service, FedEx has worked with the Postal Service to develop many of the
processes that are now used to perform aviation support under the Transportation Agreement.  Figure 1-5  illustrates the proven process flow from acceptance at the origin to delivery at the destination that we will use on the ACN contract.

Figure 1-5. FedEx Air Transport Mail Delivery Service Process    
   FedEx has developed a series of mature processes to move the air cargo from origin to destination, consistently meeting the contractual
delivery times.       As shown in  Figure 1-5 , FedEx accepts the cargo at the origin ramp and flies it to the FedEx hub airport, where it
is distributed to its correct outbound container and loaded onto an aircraft to fly to the destination airport. Each lane is managed through established scanning procedures to ensure the correct routing of the mail from origin to destination. A
 lane  describes the origin point to destination point routing of the mail, for example from origin city A to destination city B, e.g., from Atlanta to Albuquerque. The main processes in the transport of the mail as specified in the
solicitation are:

been thoroughly tested and proven over the 12-year history of the relationship.     
     Figure 1-6  compares the key processes for the ACN contract to select processes of the current Transportation
Agreement contract. We have developed these processes over time in collaboration with the Postal Service and will modify or continue processes as provided under the new ACN contract. These

1.3.1 Coordination and Oversight of FedEx Operations
    
   With responsibility for scheduling and management across the FedEx Express global network, GNP and GOCC
work closely with PTM to ensure on-time delivery of the mail. The GOCC ( Figure 1-7 ) is fully staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year with highly skilled and experienced airline operations management specialists.   
  The GOCC is one of the most sophisticated control centers in the transportation industry, with state-of-the-art facilities, information systems, and
communications, and proven plans and processes based on real-world contingency management experience and expertise. All day, every day, the GOCC team responds to and overcomes challenges, including severe weather systems, flight delays, emergency
maintenance events, and even natural disasters. The GOCC supervises and protects FedEx team members and assets while correcting situations that could impact mail delivery service to the Postal Service.

Figure 1-7. FedEx s GOCC    
   Our Global Operations Control Center is state-of-the art in managing a large airline fleet traversing the nation and the world.

FedEx has the facilities, tools,
processes, and staff to effectively respond to contingency situations. We were an industry leader in collaborating with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in responding to the events of September 11, 2001 and the restoration of aviation
support for the Postal Service. FedEx belongs to the Domestic Events Network (DEN), which was established on the morning of September 11. DEN is a 24/7, unclassified interagency telephone conference   sponsored by the security arm of the
FAA   dedicated to real-time coordination of air security issues.      FedEx has a back-up center located in Collierville, TN, that operates
the network in live mode every Monday so that this contingency control center remains fully capable of assuming operational control of our global network in an emergency.       1.3.2 Facility Support and Administrative Functions       The goal of facility management at
FedEx is to enable on-time delivery of Postal Service mail and all non-postal FedEx products. PTM ensures, through its coordination with AGFS, that local facility support and administration functions are present at each airport local ramp, ensuring
mail movement, hub support, scanning and data capture, billing support, communications, and other functions. The PTM Department, described in Section 1.0, coordinates all necessary administrative and facility support at each of the FedEx ramp
and hub locations throughout the network.      As an example, FedEx facility support includes on-site maintenance staff at each of our ramp and
hub locations. . We have more than [ * ] ground support and material handling equipment mechanics at FedEx ramps and hubs across the country. We have a planned and executed preventive maintenance program and an equipment replacement plan and
schedule to ensure that equipment is operational, capable, and available to support service delivery requirements. We ensure that gate space for our aircraft, loading and surface handling equipment, scanning equipment, and other facility
requirements as established in Section 1.3.8, are available.       1.3.3 Monitor Performance    
  The Postal Service and FedEx have developed, over the years of joint operations, and will continue to provide a series of monitoring control points that
provide a high degree of confidence for on-time and reliable mail delivery services. We will continue to operate these control points. Performance is monitored

by PTM through our well-established data capture capability that provides snapshots of our performance at 15-minute intervals, and is summarized to show our performance during the day and at the
end of day, end of week, and end of monthly operating periods. Sections 1.3.5, 1.3.10, and 1.3.15 further describe key points of data capture and distribution that provide performance monitoring input.   
  We have email distribution lists in place the for the Night Network which include Postal Service local operators, FedEx local operators, and the area and
national headquarters personnel for both organizations. Emails of the Day Summaries contain the daily recap data and an attached Excel spreadsheet providing delay details and explanatory information. The reports are prepared in a.m. and p.m.
versions and are distributed by the Senior Operations Administrator in PTM with the departmental email ID: PTM_OPS@fedex.com.      We distribute a
Weekly Service Level Report Adjusted and a Weekly Analysis Review presentation to management in several organizations including PTM and Postal Service Air Transportation Operations. We list in Section 1.3.16 in this volume a number of
reports that we prepare, including information about the intended audience, a brief description of each report, the distribution timeline, and report frequency.  Figure 1-8  lists some benefits of the FedEx performance monitoring activities.

  Establishes the ability to adjust Night Network flight schedules, re-routing, and hub operations to maximize on-time delivery of mail   
     1.3.4 Provide Feedback to the Postal Service       FedEx has Operations Administrators who track performance daily. We provide updates on Postal Service transport parameters with regard to system performance throughout the day, with recaps at the end of
each operation. Thus, feedback to the Postal Service occurs on both a formal and informal basis, with our PTM informally discussing both normal and unusual operations with their counterparts in the Postal Service and formally through the documented
reports that we describe in Section 3.3.16.       1.3.5 Ensure the Integrity of Data Entry    
  FedEx has eliminated manual data entry to reduce keying errors. In addition, we perform root cause analysis for abnormalities discovered in the data. We
have developed a program that validates the accuracy of Dispatch and Routing (D R) numbers to eliminate duplicate entries. The Error Correction (EC) program searches D R tags that have been identified as not being billed because no container
has been assigned.

The EC program goes into the PSALMS EC website, does a screen scrape of the D Rs, and downloads them
into an Excel document. The program then downloads a Truck Dispatch Report (TDR) and Flight Dispatch Report (FDR) data base and a (Postal Service Alliance Leveraging Multiple Synergies) PSALMS billing file to search against. It takes the D R and
does the search to see if the unbilled D R tag can be found on the TDR/FDR to identify a container that it can be assigned to. If the D R is found, it is then compared to D Rs already billed that are located in the PSALMS billing file.
If there is a comparable D R found, then the D R is a duplicate and the D R is not billed again. If the D R is not found in the billing file, the container found is assigned and the D R is billed using that container.   
  If the D R is not found in the TDR/FDR database, the program goes into a master database to get the corresponding scans. If the scanned data reveals
a DECONS, the D R is deemed invalid and the D R is not billed. If there is no DECONS scan and there is a CONS scan, then the CONS number is recorded and is used by the program to go into FAMIS to do an additional search of TDR and FDR data.
If the program cannot find a container to assign the D R tag to, then it is noted as  Research Required  and the engineers do more research on the D R.      [ * ]       1.3.6 Coordinate the Exchange of Information    
  FedEx has a series of comprehensive daily, weekly, and monthly reports that coordinate information across the FedEx and Postal Service organizations.
FedEx will communicate daily with the Postal Service through electronic reports, using EDI 214, Version 4010, as well as face-to-face meetings with on-site ramp personnel.      Daily reports include:      [ * ]      Weekly reports include:      [ * ]      Planning reports are provided monthly and include:      [ * ]   
  The reports are prepared in a.m. and p.m. versions and distributed by the Senior Operations Administrator in PTM with the departmental Email ID:

hubs and major sort locations. They also communicate ad hoc and alternate move activity. Flight
schedules and area operating plans identify changes to Postal Service headquarters, area offices, and the local operating teams. FedEx and the Postal Service also hold local meetings at ramp locations to manage and correct local issues.   

1.3.8 Correct Type and Quantity of Equipment    
  FedEx will continue to provide a Unit Load Device (ULD) matrix monthly, which lists the planned ULD equipment by day and by week for the month. This
information is in the Planning Matrix which will be sent to Postal Service headquarters and the local Postal Service representative in each market.      FedEx also maintains spare aircraft, crews, ULDs, vehicles, and operating equipment which are strategically positioned to ensure on-time operations and to ensure that we meet the Postal Service s
operational requirements.  Figure 1-10  lists our ramp and ground equipment that is used to load, move, and manage all air cargo, including Postal Service mail.

Postal Service freight        throughout the network on schedule.

1.3.9 Assist in Unloading or
Loading ULDs to or from Surface Transportation       FedEx will continue to assist in unloading or loading ULDs to and from all surface
transportation. FedEx has more than [ * ] ramp personnel across the network. FedEx personnel work with the Postal Service to ensure that the ULDs arriving at the origin or destination ramp are transferred to and from aircraft and trucks
expeditiously. We have accommodated this assistance requirement over our 12-year history with the Postal Service and our personnel comply with this requirement routinely to move the mail. Our local ramp managers and staff have solid working
relationships with the Postal Service representatives at each ramp location, and those relationships operate to make the Postal Service processes work without interruption to ensure that we meet daily schedule demands.   
   1.3.10 Scan Material Handling Units (required) or Postal MTE       FedEx performs scans on all handling units to ensure the chain of custody and accountability for all Postal Service handling units tendered to FedEx. All handling units will be scanned consistent with our
established best practices. FedEx will perform possession scans, load scans, hub sort scans, hub nest scans, and delivery scans. Scan data will be aggregated and transmitted via electronic EDI to FedEx and Postal Service information technology
systems. No scanning of Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) is required as FedEx is not performing the THS function.       1.3.11 Process Mail for
Dispatch from the Aviation Supplier s Facility to the Postal Service Facility       Upon request from the Postal Service, FedEx will
process mail for movement via aircraft, tug and dolly, containerized trucks, and bulk trucks as necessary, from our facility to the Postal Service facility.

Before the start of the sort, any EML that has been rolled from the previous Night Sort Operations is to
be staged in the appropriate staging area. Any EML which does not move on the scheduled night sort is held for sorting on the next night sort. Any EML that is not scanning correctly will be taken immediately to the Postal Service Re-Label Area. The
Postal Service Re-Label Area has been given instructions on how to handle EML with distribution table problems.      FedEx will comply with all
requirements and will accept all the statements in the solicitation for this section. The additional charge is for replacing a D R tag that is missing or becomes illegible. The Postal Service will provide equipment to FedEx to perform this
function.       1.3.12 Close-Out, Receive, and Dispatch All Surface Vehicles       FedEx will continue to work closely with all THS providers to close out, receive, and dispatch all surface vehicles. Our streamlined approach will be managed by the FedEx ramp manager at each service
point.       1.3.13 Handle Overflow Volumes per Postal Service General Directions       FedEx will continue to work closely with the Postal Service to accept overflow volumes of mail. Our ramp managers, in collaboration with Postal Service managers, will make every effort to accept and
process all overflow volumes when possible. FedEx ramp managers at service point locations will coordinate with Postal Service staff to identify overflow situations as early as possible, develop solutions to handle the overflow volumes, and resolve
the overflow situation quickly and effectively with zero to minimal impact on mail delivery service schedules.   

1.3.14 Cooperate With All Aviation Suppliers in the Transportation Service Chain    
  At both the PTM management level and the local ramp manager level, FedEx will cooperate with all suppliers in the transportation chain including air
carriers, air cargo companies, airport staff, and THS service providers.      Areas of cooperation will include items such as sharing ground
handling equipment when one party has equipment breakdowns, sharing joint-use ramps, and working collaboratively to deal with contingency events or irregular operations that would endanger on-time performance.   
   1.3.15 Enter Data Timely and Accurately    
  FedEx has developed a series of processes that depend on accurate and timely collection of data  (Figure 1-11 ). The foundation for quickly capturing
data in a highly accurate manner is the electronic identification of cargo as it moves from its origin to its destination. Bar code scanning establishes the foundation for FedEx s near-100% accuracy and high speed of data capture for fast-paced
and time-sensitive processes.   

Figure 1-11. Electronic Bar Code Scanning    
   Bar code scanning of tags and ULD devices ensures accurate and timely data capture.

These data capture techniques and
system updates allow customers to determine the progress of their cargo from origin to destination. The accuracy of the data capture also allows the network performance reports to be prepared and submitted to the Postal Service. FedEx has been at
the forefront of the industry in the development of these rapid data capture technologies and has applied them to all processes in the Postal Service network.

1.3.16 Prepare Required Reports       FedEx has prepared and submitted all required and requested reports over the life of the current Postal Service contract. As requested by the Postal Service, FedEx will continue to provide these reports
under the Air Cargo Network contract. Reports submitted under the current contract will be continued as is, or modified as required by the solicitation. These reports include:      [ * ]      In addition to these reports, FedEx will also provide new reports that are required to
meet Postal Service requirements. In all reports, we will be diligent in providing accurate, timely information to enable Postal Service oversight and management of the ACN contract.       1.3.16.1 Daily Mail Condition Report       [ * ]   
   1.3.16.2 Operational Condition Reports    
  [ * ]       1.3.16.3 Dimensional Weight Reports
      [ * ]       1.3.17 Perform
Verification of Security Seals on Surface Transportation       FedEx will continue to verify all security seals on surface transportation prior
to leaving our facility, as we have done since 2001. This will be a physical inspection of security seals on each trailer upon receipt by FedEx. The verification inspection will also be done prior to tendering the mail to the Postal Service. The
FedEx ramp manager at each ramp will ensure that all security seals are verified and logged by ramp staff. The process involves verifying the integrity of the seal on the back of the trailer and noting it on the Truck Dispatch Report paperwork.
      1.3.18 Ensure the Security of All Mail       It is the mission of FedEx to protect and safeguard all mail from the time it is tendered to FedEx until the time FedEx tenders it to the Postal Service. We accomplish this through a combination of
training of staff, physical protection of facilities, and scanning of mail up to nine times from tender to FedEx through tender to the Postal Service. We also run background checks on all employees, and we conduct drug screening to ensure we have a
drug-free workplace to decrease the likelihood of security incidents related to the mail while it is in our possession.      We provide initial
and annual refresher training on mail handling and on the importance of the security of the mail to all FedEx employees involved in the contract. We have physical protection capabilities at each ramp location including closed-circuit video
surveillance, facility access control, intrusion detection, and routine patrols by FedEx or local uniformed security staff. We maintain tight access control at all facilities to ensure that only authorized individuals are allowed into areas
processing mail. Individuals attempting to enter or exit a sorting facility must successfully clear established screening checkpoints. These checkpoints:

Ensure that the employee/vendor has an active ID badge.      

Screen each employee/vendor for contraband through our x-ray and metal detecting devices.      

Ensure that all customer property remains in designated sorting areas.      
  Through this combination of security procedures, security equipment, trained FedEx employees, and uniformed security staff, FedEx provides a heightened
level of security to protect mail while it is in our possession.       1.4 Designation (Postal Service Performs Terminal Handling Service (THS)
  Night Network)       FedEx will accept direct tender of night volume from the Postal Service and the Postal Service will accept direct
tender from FedEx to satisfy the requirement for the aviation supplier to provide THS functions on the Night Network.       1.5 Delivery and
Specific Delivery Instructions (Postal Service Performs THS Operation on Day Network)       Not applicable to Night Network.   
   1.5.1 Delivery   Day Network       Not
applicable to Night Network.       1.5.2 Delivery   Night Network       FedEx and the Postal Service have developed efficient and effective coordination processes and procedures over our long relationship to expedite the delivery of mail. All FedEx employees, as they do
today, will assist Postal Service employees in both the unloading of inbound surface vehicles and the loading and dispatching of outbound surface vehicles. FedEx routinely transmits reports to the Postal Service (see Section 1.3.16 for report
details) on mail delivery status and operational issues. Regularly scheduled meetings enable a broader audience to discuss a wide range of topics, while daily communications focus on tactical issues such as extra volume and late tender. Daily
interface between the Postal Service and FedEx occurs via email; phone; and face-to-face meetings among PTM engineers and management, FedEx ramp managers, and local Postal Service contract and operations managers.   
  FedEx will deliver mail to the Postal Service on or before the latest delivery time (as indicated in Attachment 12) for the Night Network. At all
destination service points, FedEx will unload the mail from the ULDs received, scan it, and deliver it to the Postal Service as outlined in Attachment 4, Operating Plan, Night Network. FedEx will accept direct tender of night volume from the Postal
Service to satisfy the requirement for the aviation supplier to provide THS functions on the Night Network.      The FedEx matrix plan will cover
Night Network. Tender and service commitments by delivery times will be tracked, measured, and reviewed for potential service improvements by the customer service and relationship team within PTM at FedEx.

1.6 Boarding Priority    

FedEx will adhere to Postal Service boarding priorities as we have done successfully on the
Transportation Agreement since 2001.     
    In accordance with Postal Service priorities, FedEx will adhere to the boarding priority described in the following
sections.       1.6.1 Boarding Priority   Day Network       Not applicable to Night Network.       1.6.2 Boarding Priority   Night Network    
  In the Night Network, FedEx will load accepted mail in the following mail boarding preference order:   

1.  
  Express Mail         

2.  
  All other classes of mail        Any repossession of
mail by the Postal Service without exercising the rights outlined in this RFP under Repossession of Mail by the Postal Service will be determined by the Postal Service designee, depending on circumstances.   
   1.7 Frequency        

FedEx will provide aviation supplier support to meet all Postal Service frequency of service
requirements     
    The frequency of service for the Night Network is based on 5 days of Postal Service delivery, Monday through Friday. This
provides approximately 254 operating days annually (255 in a leap year). Excluded holidays are discussed in section 1.14.5 in this proposal.   
   1.8 Mail Assignment and Transport   Day Network       Not applicable to Night Network       1.9 Mail Assignment and Transport   Night Network

Mail assignment and transport, the heart of the current Transportation Agreement, will also be the core
of the new CAN contract and will continue to be a focus for feedback and improvement,     
    FedEx will prepare and deliver flight schedules to the Postal Service at least 30 days in advance of the first day of the
operating period. These schedules are developed by PTM and are part of the Network Operating Plan as operational documents that convert the plan into action. After receipt of flight schedules, the Postal Service will create dispatch routing
instructions based on FedEx flight schedules that subsequently are shown on the Postal Service D R tag.      Mail Assignment and Transport
Process   Night Network defines how the Postal Service will give FedEx tendered mail and illustrates the steps required in the planning process for assignment and transport, as shown in  Figure 1-12 .

15     

Figure 1-12. Mail Assignment and Transport Process    
   This process, jointly developed by the Postal Service and FedEx, facilitates on-time delivery.    
  Once flight schedules and dispatch routing instructions have been exchanged, the Postal Service will show the routing on D R tags and deliver not
less than 75% of total volume assigned to the Night Network outbound flights per the time listed in Attachment 12. The Postal Service will then provide the remaining 25% of total volume at the time specified by location in Attachment 12.  All
Mail Due FedEx Time  is outlined in Attachment 12 and is the time that the last piece of mail tendered must be in FedEx s hands.   
   1.10 Aviation Provider Planned Accommodation   Day Network       Not applicable to Night Network.       1.11 Aviation Provider Planned Accommodation   Night
Network        

Flexibility to handle additional volume required by the Postal Service is part of our commitment to
providing the most dependable, reliable, and customer-focused service.     
    FedEx will accept up to 120% of planned capacity in the Night Network for each origin daily. Should tendered mail exceed
120% of planned capacity, FedEx has the option to refuse the excess; however, throughout the current relationship, FedEx frequently has handled volumes tendered by the Postal Service in excess of the guarantee. Such flexibility is part of our
commitment to providing the most dependable, reliable and customer-focused service to the Postal Service.       1.12 Treatment of Exceptional
Types of Mail        

Over the past 6 years, FedEx has integrated the special handling requirements associated with the
increasing amounts of exceptional types of mail into our normal daily operations.     
    Since 2006, the volume of exceptional mail types, including lives, perishables, and HAZMAT, has increased continuously.
FedEx provides rigorous training in the handling of exceptional types of mail as part of the training for new employees and annual refresher training.       1.12.1 Treatment of Live Mail       For live mail handling, FedEx will continue to use a
multi-step process that covers all aspects of receipt, verification of live mail viability, inspection, scanning, loading, and unloading of both perishable and live mail. The FedEx guidelines include all requirements outlined in the Postal Service
Domestic Mail Manual 601, Subsection 9.3.      Prior to contract award, as specified in the Statement of Work, FedEx and the Postal Service will
negotiate an attachment that lays out the specifics of transportation of perishable and live mail. Because FedEx has been handling these exceptional types of mail for six years, we expect minimal issues.

16     

1.12.2 Treatment of Perishables       Perishable mail is treated in the same manner as that described in Section 1.12.1.   
   1.12.3 Treatment of Registered Mail       To
accurately track each piece of Registered Mail, FedEx will provide the Postal Service with the following information:       

Aircraft number          

Aircraft compartment location          

Actual flight departure time          

Any accident or irregularities          

D R tags indicating final destination air stop.         FedEx will send an email alerting the Postal Service of Registered Mail that has failed to make its planned dispatch; we will then await instructions from the Postal Service.   
   1.12.4 Treatment of Hazardous Material (HAZMAT)       FedEx follows and will continue to follow all applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, OSHA and FAA rules and regulations in the handling of HAZMAT. We
provide extensive training to certify Dangerous Goods Specialists to ensure that all Postal Service HAZMAT will be handled in accordance with regulatory requirements. FedEx personnel take annual refresher training on the handling of HAZMAT, which
means that all FedEx personnel have up-to-date information on any changes to procedures or policies as well as the review of current procedures. FedEx will comply with all Postal Service requirements for the tagging and treatment of HAZMAT as
follows:       

Tagging of hazardous materials          

ORM-D Air  is for air and surface transport;  ORM-D  is for surface transport only.      

Division Class 6.2  is permitted only for medical/veterinary use, research or laboratory certification for public health. The shipper must pack
these goods to withstand shocks, pressure changes, and other handling conditions.          

Division Class 9  is for miscellaneous materials presenting hazards during transport (solid dry ice, elevated temperature substances,
environmentally hazardous substances, lifesaving appliances, asbestos).          

Hazardous and Dangerous Goods and all other hazardous material.      

Assignment of hazardous materials          

Must be tendered at least 2 hours prior to final tender time of flight.      

There is no surcharge.          

Manifest copy and items must be handed to a FedEx representative 2 hours prior to closeout time of flight.      

Verification of postal manifest includes checking the number of pieces, weight, inclusion of appropriate shipper s certification in aircraft load
manifest, and completeness of pilot notification paperwork.          

Documentation of refusal to handle HAZMAT includes name, address of mailer and FedEx location, type and amount of HAZMAT, and reason for refusal.

Procedures for HAZMAT spills, releases, incidents, and emergencies. In the 12 years that FedEx has worked with the Postal Service, there have been NO
exceptions to these procedures:          

While the HAZMAT is in the possession of FedEx, but not onboard aircraft, damaged HAZMAT items must not be loaded.

17     

For items causing injury, illness, significant property damage, or disruption of operations, FedEx will complete PS Form 1770 and submit to the Postal
Service.          

If there is an incident while onboard aircraft, FedEx must complete DOT Form F 5800.1. Within 24 hours, a copy of the form must be sent to the COR.
Such incidents include HAZMAT cargo spills that come into contact with mail.          1.13 Offshore Capacity Requirement  
Day Network       Not applicable to Night Network.       1.14 Volume Commitment   General Information        

Throughout the 12-year Transportation Agreement relationship, FedEx has generally had
sufficient capacity to handle whatever volume the Postal Service required.     
    FedEx will continue our 12-year record of successfully supporting the Postal Service s dynamic volume requirements
and of meeting service level agreements (SLAs) for aviation services. Our knowledge and understanding of the Postal Service mission, operations, culture, and technology provides a non-disruptive, no-risk option for the Postal Service   no
learning curve, no initial training for existing employees, no changes in processes. Essentially, all activities will continue in the manner that the Postal Service has enjoyed since the beginning of the strategic alliance with FedEx.   
  FedEx has the fleet, pilots, facilities, and support staff   including [ * ] A P-certified aircraft mechanics   to immediately support
future Postal Service volume schedules and forecasts. From Day 1 of the new contract, FedEx can handle any Postal Service volume based on historical volumes.  Figure 1-13  is a 1-day sample from a peak week in December 2011 that clearly shows
our ability to support Postal Service volume schedules and forecasts.       Figure 1-13. Daily Volume Commitment Versus Actual

     1.15 Operating Periods       FedEx will plan and operate the Night Network in accordance with Attachment 1, Postal Service Operating Periods. Because FedEx has been providing services for 12 years based on Transportation Agreement
operating periods very similar to those specified in Attachment 1, the transition to the new contract will be virtually risk-free and indistinguishable to the Postal Service. FedEx will provide to the Postal Service our monthly operating plan
30 days before the beginning of the operating period, and will specify the specific type of airline ULD per origin/destination, and destination of airline ULD   mixed (to be sorted at hub) in those locations that are not loose loaded.
      1.16 Ordering Process   Introduction        

FedEx will use the proven ordering process used successfully under the current
Transportation Agreement to meet Postal Service peak and non-peak volume requirements.     
    The Postal Service process for ordering air transportation for mail to and from destinations in the contiguous 48 states
and Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands is provided at Day 120 for non-peak periods and Day 150 for peak periods.      Because the
current ordering process is very similar to that outlined in the ACN statement of work (SOW), FedEx has already demonstrated the ability to work within the specified timeframes. Careful planning means that mail tendered to FedEx will arrive on time
at the proper service point, thus maintaining the Postal Service s historical record for quality service.       1.16.1 Ordering Process
  Non-Peak   Day Network       Not applicable to Night Network.       1.16.2 Ordering Process   Non-Peak   Night Network       The non-peak Night Network
process will begin with the Postal Service providing FedEx a request for mail volumes that delineates each lane pair (origin and destination) Monday through Friday for the average day. Volumes by lane pair will be specified by weight.  Figure 1-15
 provides further details of this process.

      The 4 or 5 weeks that make up each peak operating period include Christmas week so that the requested volume capacity is sufficient to
meet Postal Service volume requirements for holiday mail delivery. Both non-peak and peak volume forecasting specify individual origin and destination lane pairs and are expressed in pounds.      The ordering process for peak Night Network is illustrated in  Figure 1-16 . FedEx and the Postal Service have established and improved both peak and non-peak ordering processes over our 12-year
relationship. This alliance has fostered a very effective continuous improvement environment that identifies areas for positive change and implements the changes.

   Detailed planning and coordination with the Postal Service ensures that FedEx will meet contract delivery schedules and volumes.
       1.17 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Including Scanning and Data Transmission    

FedEx has the infrastructure and experience with EDI to provide the Postal Service with a
low-risk solution for rapid transmission of high-volume data streams.     
    FedEx will transmit and receive status and operational data according to the EDI standards as required in the
solicitation, Attachment 7, Electronic Data Interchange Service Requirements. Additionally, we will transmit payment information using the Attachment 7 standards for financial data. We will use the standards shown in  Figure 1-17  for
transactions of volume and relevant scans with the Postal Service.

INVOIC ADV   
      
  Message claiming payment for goods and services supplied under agreed-upon conditions; also serves as specification for Debit Note and Credit Note messages. Postal Service
implementation is to provide invoice advice to its transport providers of the items, which comprise amounts payable for transportation services.   

CLAIMS   
      
  Message claiming payment for goods and services supplied under agreed-upon conditions; also serves as specification for Debit Note and Credit Note messages. Postal Service
implementation is to provide mechanism for its transport providers to report claims for the mail handling items which comprise amounts payable for transportation services.   
    EDI based on the UN/EDIFACT format is ideal technology for the high volume of transactions that will
be processed, based on contract requirements. FedEx owns the world s largest private digitized, value-added network (VAN) for business-to-business data exchange, FedExNet     , which allows us to easily accommodate large data streams. We have successfully used the FedExNet      VAN for the Postal Service since 2001 to transmit and receive operational and status data, as well as payment data. We are very familiar with the Attachment 7 EDI
requirements and standards, as we have used CARDIT and RESDIT protocols extensively since 2005 for international postal customers.      The status and operational data, as well as payment data, will be transmitted over the VAN as shown in  Figure 1-18 . Primary files on the FedEx side reside in the Scanning Database, which stores and
transmits scans and service files (shown as SRS, Summary Reporting System) and the PSALMS Revenue Database, which stores invoice and reconciliation files (shown as REV). With EDI, the Postal Service will receive the invoice and reconciliation data
from FedEx via a secure mailbox on FedExNet     .

1.18 Reports (See Section 1.3.16)    

FedEx will continue to provide all required and requested reports over the life of the ACN
contract.     
    In Section 1.3.16 of this volume, we list the RFP-required reports and other, suggested reports that are useful for
monitoring performance on this contract and that provide input for future volume and schedule planning.       1.19 Performance Requirements and
Measurement        

The knowledge and understanding FedEx has of Postal Service processes will enable us to
meet or exceed your service performance requirements.     
    FedEx will comply with the solicitation, meeting the delivery performance requirements during an operating period on a
lane-by-lane basis, of:       

Night Network: [ * ]%          

Peak operating period: [ * ]% for the Day and Night Networks.         As presented in Section 1.17, we will perform all required scans to provide baseline operational, status, and invoice data to the Postal Service.   
   At Origin:

1.20 Reduction of Payment    

The FedEx commitment to the Postal Service, as shown by our high level of service over the
past 12 years, demonstrates our ability to achieve desired service levels and minimize payment penalties.     
    FedEx will comply with the reductions in payment as specified in the solicitation. There is no penalty for handling units
meeting delivery performance standards during an operating period on a lane-by-lane basis of:       

[ * ] for Night Network

1.22 Payment Procedures    

The basis of all payments is the scanned information that we will transmit promptly to
ensure accurate and complete invoicing and payments.     
    In this section we present details of payment procedures, including:   

Rates and Payment General          

Payment Processing   Night Network   Per Pound.          1.22.1 Rates and Payment General       The basis of all rates and payments is the scans,
beginning with the possession/load scan and ending with the delivery scan at the completion of the FedEx delivery to the Postal Service. FedEx understands that if the delivery scan is not submitted or is not at the correct location, there will be no
payment. FedEx team members take great care in handling our customers  packages. Postal Service shipments enter our sorting system at specific times, are scanned, and then secured in the appropriate containers, trailers, or aircraft.
     The FedEx payment process includes electronic remittance advice and electronic funds transfer (EFT) to reduce much of the cost and paperwork
involved in issuing payments. Both of these tools reduce check processing costs, while ensuring quick and accurate application of payment. Remittance advice file processing is automatically included with the EDI invoices.   
    1.22.1.1 Scan Requirements        FedEx
will comply with all scanning and data transmission requirements as stated in the solicitation. FedEx leads the transportation industry in scanning and tracking technology. Packages are scanned during our pickup, sort, and delivery processes by
handlers and by automated overhead scanners and scanning systems. Scanning enables FedEx and the Postal Service to observe the movement of packages electronically from pickup to delivery for an added level of security and end-to-end tracking of the
mail. Using a variety of wireless data collection devices such as PScan and PowerPad as shown in  Figure 1-21 , we scan D R tags at each hand-off point, capturing a variety of shipment information, including:   

Dispatch and routing number  
          Origin/destination
location information      
      Ship date   
     
        Exception scans  
          Type of
service      
      Proof of delivery.

1.22.1.2 Night Turn Scan Requirements     
  FedEx will comply with all night turn scan requirements and will perform the following scans:       At Origin:        

Possession/load scan of ULDs and handling units (D R tags)          At Destination:

  Not applicable to Night Network.       1.22.4
Payment Processing   Night Network   Per Pound         1.22.4.1 Invoicing     
  FedEx accepts the solicitation requirements for invoicing and payment for the Night Network based on pounds and completion of scans during the operating
periods. We will include additional charges not covered by the automated payments system in our monthly invoices. FedEx will produce an invoice weekly, based on a service week that begins at 0000 hours Saturday and ends at 2359 on Friday. We will
submit the invoice by noon on Wednesday in order to receive payments by Wednesday, 3 weeks following the receipt of the invoice.   
    1.22.4.2 Economic Adjustments     
  FedEx will comply with all requirements in the solicitation section on Economic Adjustments. Only the non-fuel line haul rate will be economically
adjusted. We will use the economic adjustments in Attachment 10, Pricing.        1.22.4.3 Re-Labeling Charge     
  FedEx will comply with all requirements and will accept all statements in the solicitation for this section. FedEx understands that the Postal Service
will pay an additional charge for replacing a D R tag that is missing or becomes illegible. The Postal Service will provide equipment to FedEx to perform this function.      Re-labeling is an example of our commitment to the Postal Service. In 2002, the Postal Service approached FedEx requesting that we take over the re-labeling function at the Memphis hub. From the time we
assumed responsibility for this area, most if not all pieces move out the same day that they arrive at the sort. FedEx re-labels approximately [ * ] pieces per day on a non-contingency day. Approximately [*] times per month, the Postal Service
declares a contingency (meaning its SAMS equipment is down in the local market) and the unlabeled handling units are sent to the Memphis hub, where FedEx labels the mail. In these situations, we label between [ * ] and [ * ] handling units of mail
and introduce them back into the network, thereby allowing the Postal Service to accomplish mail delivery service to its customers.       1.23
Reconciliation Process        

FedEx will work collaboratively with the Postal Service to reconcile and resolve all
payment issues as expeditiously as possible.     
    FedEx will comply with the requirements in the solicitation section entitled Reconciliation Process. The Postal Service
Revenue Team and the FedEx Revenue Team have worked together since 2001 to refine many different reconciliation items. Through constant diligence in monitoring the revenue stream for anomalies, we have collaboratively developed the current
reconciliation process. With this knowledge and experience with the Postal Service reconciliation process, FedEx will continue to review and refine the reconciliation process to support the Postal Service s reconciliation requirements and
process on the ACN contract.

1.24 Mode of Transportation to Service Each Air Stop   (Mail Assignment and Transport) as
Identified in Tender and Delivery Specifications Listed in Attachment 3 and Attachment 4        

As one of the most reliable, dependable, and largest air cargo carriers in the world, with
a record of successfully supporting the Postal Service since 2001, we will be able to provide all modes of transportation to service each air stop on Day 1 of the ACN contract.     
    The mode of transportation to service each air stop will be provided in the Monthly Operating Plan, which provides the
details for each operating period. We will tailor our plans, including modes of transportation, to Postal Service needs. The FedEx Express aircraft fleet is shown in  Figure 1-22 . In addition, FedEx has on-call arrangements to lease additional
aircraft to handle peak volume and other contingencies.       Figure 1-22. FedEx Express Aircraft Fleet    
   FedEx has ample capacity to service each air stop.

  Maximum Operational revenue payload is the lesser of the net volume-limited payload and the net maximum structural payload.     

2  
  This aircraft model will be introduced in 2013 and is included here to show the contribution over the life of the contract.     
  In addition to our aircraft, FedEx Express operates approximately 52,400 ground transport vehicles, including pickup and delivery vans, larger trucks
called container transport vehicles, and over-the-road tractors and trailers. These vehicles are strategically located at service points across the network to support volumes and service delivery requirements and are repositioned to meet mail
service delivery schedules.

1.25 Other Components of the Statement of Work Not Previously Discussed    
  This section presents components of this solicitation which are not discussed earlier or are referenced in Volume 1. We have added this subsection for
easier cross-reference.       1.25.1 Service Points       FedEx currently serves all locations in the Night Network via our extensive U.S. network using five air cargo hubs. Beginning on Day 1, FedEx can furnish all services to all locations specified in the
solicitation in Attachments 3 and 4. Because we are the world s largest air cargo carrier and have successfully performed on this contract for the last 12 years, we are uniquely qualified to provide uninterrupted service to the Postal Service
through our infrastructure, support facilities, and continuity of staff.       1.25.2 Management Plan    
  Our Management Plan details are fully presented in Volume 1, Section 3.0. Since the solicitation calls for a full response for all SOW elements, we
have added this reference to facilitate evaluation and use during the contract period.       1.25.3 Repossession of Mail by the Postal Service
      FedEx will fully comply with the solicitation requirement to provide repossession of mail by the Postal Service in the event that the
Postal Service requires mail to be returned. We will actively work with local Postal Service agents or representatives to expeditiously return the mail.       1.25.4 Local Agreements       In accordance with the solicitation, no local agreements, informal
agreements, or working agreements made without appropriate binding authority will bind or obligate the Postal Service or FedEx.       1.25.5
Operating Periods       The FedEx response fully addresses all activities in the operating periods, including planning, transport operations,
and payments. We will offer the full range of services throughout the entire life of the contract.       1.25.6 Incentive Plan    
  FedEx is committed to achieving the service level agreements for mail delivery required by the ACN contract. Additionally, we will work collaboratively
with the Postal Service after contract award to establish an incentive plan to improve our overall mail delivery performance rating, with the goal of achieving to achieve [ * ]% in Year 3 starting in October 2015, and [ * ]% in Year 5 beginning in
October 2017, for the Non-Peak Day Network. Our approach will build on our record of outstanding mail delivery performance for the Postal Service over the past 12 years.       1.25.7 Sustainability       Sustainability requirements are addressed in Volume 1,
Section 6.0.       1.25.8 Security       Security requirements are addressed in Volume 1, Section 5.0.

  In addition to the contingency conditions addressed in Section 2 of this proposal, FedEx knows that there are a multitude of additional situations,
from snow to volcanoes to typhoons that have the potential to impact our aviation network and our support for the Postal Service. In all cases, GOCC, in close collaboration with PTM, anticipates contingency events, assesses possible impacts, tailors
and implements contingency plans, performs all required actions, and manages the contingency situation through to closure. FedEx s primary objective in dealing with contingencies is to ensure that we continue to provide all required mail
delivery services according to Postal Service contract schedules.       2.9 Training of Employees on Contingency Plan    
  Contingencies, from blizzards to hurricanes to floods, are a way of life for FedEx employees. Our staff has to be prepared at any given moment to respond
to contingencies, implement proven plans, and continue service to our customers. Our employees, from the GOCC contingency planners and managers, to the PTM management team, to the ramp staff at each FedEx airport location, are trained to deal with
events

  The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making the award. If it is later
determined that the offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Postal Service, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

b.  
  The Postal Service will nest all Handling Units into ULDs at origin.         

c.  
  The Postal Service will tender the nested ULDs to the aviation supplier at origin.     

d.  
  The aviation supplier will scan the ULDs with a Possession Scan at origin.     

e.  
  The aviation supplier will scan all Handling Units processed through the sort at the hub.     

f.  
  The aviation supplier will nest all Handling Units to ULDs departing from the hub.     

g.  
  The aviation supplier will scan the ULDs as delivered to the Postal Service upon arrival at destination.     

h.  
  The Postal Service will break the ULDs and scan / de-nest all Handling Units.        Delivery performance will be measured for all ULDs and Handling Units receiving at least a Delivery Scan by the aviation supplier.      The Postal Service will provide data to the aviation supplier via electronic files. The electronic file will show the nested date and time into the ULD, the possession time and date from the aviation
supplier, the delivery time and date from the aviation supplier, and the de-nested break time and date from the Postal Service. Additionally, the files will show the weights of each Handling Unit.   
  Delivery performance on a lane level basis will be calculated as follows:      Total on-time Handling Units, by lane, for the Operating Period, receiving a Delivery Scan      Divided by      Total Handling Units, by lane, for the Operating Period, receiving a
Delivery Scan        Reduction of Payment        If the calculated delivery performance is less than the delivery performance requirement, the late D R tags will be ordered chronologically by the RDT. The percentage of D R tags corresponding to
the difference between [ * ]% and the delivery performance requirement (i.e., [ * ]% (Day Network), [ * ]% (Night Network) or [ * ]% (Peak Operating Period)) will not be assessed a reduction in payment. The remaining late D R tags will be
assessed a reduction in payment as follows:       

a.  
  All Handling Units delivered up to thirty (30) minutes late will be subject to a [ * ]% reduction of the Transportation Payment.     

b.  
  All Handling Units delivered from thirty-one (31) minutes up to one (1) hour to late will be subject to a [ * ]% reduction of the Transportation Payment.

c.  
  All Handling Units delivered 1 hour and one minute late or later will be subject to a [ * ]% reduction of the Transportation Payment.     
  The reduction in payment will be based on a conversion of the weight of the late Handling Units to cubic feet by the applicable mail class density and
will be applied at the base or the tier in which the late delivery occurred.        Performance Management     
  The aviation supplier and the Postal Service will meet once a quarter (at a minimum) to discuss items such as the following:   

a.

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 1: Statement of Work          
     Personnel Screening        In general, the Postal Service accepts air carrier security program requirements set forth by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). In addition to these, the Postal Service also mandates
additional requirements.      The Postal Service is aware that the aviation supplier must implement its human resources programs in accordance
with certain state laws and that in that respect there may be certain deviations to the literal application of some of the Postal Service requirements set forth herein.      In the event the aviation supplier establishes that a state law prohibits it from requesting from its employees or prospective employees any or all of the information requested in responses to questions
21a through 21e of PS Form 2025,  Contract Personnel Questionnaire , as required by 1.d below, or from certifying, as the result of a criminal records check, to any of the items requested under 1.b,  Criminal History , below, the aviation
supplier shall be relieved of its contractual obligation to require employees or prospective employees to respond to the portions of those questions requesting the prohibited information or to provide that information as part of its criminal records
check. In these situations, the Postal Service Security Investigations Service Center (SISC) shall conduct the required criminal checks as outlined in 1.b. below.      To establish the existence and the extent of the prohibitory effect of any such state law referenced above, the aviation supplier shall provide to the SISC documentary evidence (including a copy of the
state law) demonstrating the stated prohibition. The Postal Service s concurrence about the prohibitory nature of a state law shall not be unreasonably withheld.      The Contracting Officer may, in consultation with the aviation supplier and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, grant other appropriate deviations or implement alternate processes to the standard U.S.
Postal Inspection Service requirements by letter.        Applicability        Individuals providing services to the Postal Service under this contract (including aviation suppliers, employees of aviation suppliers, and subcontractors and their employees at all levels), hereinafter,
 individuals,  who have been hired after the effective date of this contract and whose duties will or likely may involve handing the mail must obtain a security clearance from the Postal Service, as provided herein. Access to the mail as
defined by 3.a below is permitted as soon as the security clearance package has been submitted to the SISC in Memphis.      If the aviation
supplier commences a new operation (internally or with an aviation supplier) for the purpose of processing Postal volume, the employees hired since the effective date of this contract will be subject to Personnel Screening.   
  Access to the mail is permitted as soon as the security clearance package has been submitted to the SISC in Memphis. If the aviation supplier has ground
handling services performed at air stops by another aviation supplier (subcontractor), and if, to the best knowledge of the prime aviation supplier, that subcontractor is in compliance with the provisions of this clause, the prime aviation supplier
may certify that fact to the Contracting Officer in writing, and thereby be relieved of the primary responsibility for personnel screening. Prime aviation suppliers are in all cases responsible for meeting these screening requirements for all
persons having access to the mail who are their direct employees. For example, if ABC, Inc. is an aviation supplier, and it performs ground handling services at one or more air stops for CDE, Inc., CDE must certify in writing that:   
   I certify that at the following air stops ground handling services are being performed by ABC, and that to the best of my knowledge,
ABC is an aviation supplier of air transportation services under contract number    . A listing of airports served by ABC is attached hereto as follows.       Aviation suppliers must have clauses in their contracts with subcontractors requiring adherence to the Postal Service screening procedures contained in this contract.

c.  
  In cases where an individual business entity is predominant at a given airport, the Contracting Officer in consultation with the Inspection Service may approve the
receipt of screening documents from that entity.         

d.  
  The aviation supplier shall maintain supporting documentation for the drug screening (1.a), criminal history inquiries (1.b), and citizenship verifications
(1.d) subject to review by the Postal Service, for the life of this contract in accordance with its internal procedures, advising the Inspection Service SISC on the Certification and Transmittal Cover Sheet.     
  At the employee s local station, aviation suppliers are only required to maintain a copy of the Certification and Transmittal Cover

  ULD cubic feet will be paid at the agreed cubic feet size for each ULD type described in  Attachment 10: Pricing .   
  The cubic feet paid will be based on the Postal assigned ULD type. If the Postal ULD type is missing, the aviation supplier s ULD type will be used
for invoicing. Any discrepancies between the types of ULD processed will be resolved during the Reconciliation Process.      The transportation
payment for mixed ULDs will be based on the applicable cubic feet of the originating ULD. These transportation payments will be reduced for Handling Units not receiving a Delivery Scan by converting the weight of the Handling Units without a
Delivery Scan at the correct destination to cubic feet by the applicable mail class density.      The transportation payment for bypass ULDs will
be based on the applicable cubic feet of the originating ULD. These transportation payments will not be made for Bypass ULDs without a Delivery Scan at the correct destination.      Recognizing operational inefficiencies filling the last ULD at every location, the Postal Service will incorporate within the daily invoice a daily credit based on the total cubic feet of the mixed ULDs
in the Operating Plan divided by the total number of mixed ULDs in the Operating Plan for each origin air stop per day multiplied by 50%. The rate used will be the applicable base or tier cubic foot rate used at the beginning of the invoice day.
      Mail Tendered from Surface Trucks       If mail is tendered to the aviation supplier from a defined truck location as identified in  Attachments 3 and 4  at contract award, the invoiced cubic feet will be calculated by dividing the
Handling Unit s Postal Service assigned rounded weight by the applicable mail class density.       Mail Tendered from Ad Hoc Trucks into
the Aviation Supplier Hub       The aviation supplier will accept ad hoc trucks from the Postal Service at the proposed hub locations. The
invoiced cubic feet for ad hoc trucks will be calculated by dividing the Handling Unit s Postal Service assigned rounded weight by the applicable mail class density. Recognizing the reduced work content, the aviation supplier will provide an
unload rate in  Attachment 10: Pricing  for the receipt and processing of all ad hoc truck mail volume. The Postal Service will incorporate ad hoc truck payments in the weekly electronic payment.   
   Aviation Supplier Surface Transportation   Not Included in the Transportation Payment    
  The aviation supplier will include a separate rate per mile for Highway Transportation in  Attachment 10: Pricing  which will be applied when the
Postal Service requires the aviation supplier to operate unplanned surface transportation of mail.       Hub Sort Scan Charge    
  The Postal Service will pay a Hub Sort Scan charge for mail sorted and scanned at a hub per Handling Unit (i.e., D R Tag) as shown in  Attachment
10: Pricing . This rate will not be subject to an increase for the full term of the contract.   
         Page 27 of 101

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 1: Statement of Work          
   Handling Units sorted at a hub must receive a Hub Sort Scan for payment purposes. The Postal Service
will not pay a Hub Sort Scan charge for sorts not supported by EDI scan information. The pieces scanned into a tendered Bypass container are not eligible to receive Hub Sort Scan charges.       Re-Labeling Charge       The Postal Service will pay an additional charge to the aviation
supplier for re-labeling Postal Service Handling Units at the hub for which the D R tag is missing or becomes illegible. The Postal Service will also provide all equipment necessary to perform this function. The re-labeling charge per Handling
Unit is shown in  Attachment 10: Pricing .      This rate will not be subject to an increase for the full term of the contract.   
  Payment to the aviation supplier for the transport of re-labeled Handling Units will be based upon data received from the Hub Scan plus (combined and
matched with) the Delivery Scan for the Handling Unit. An average weight per Handling Unit will be established based upon the previous month s data for average weight per Handling Unit, and for Handling Units that are not properly scanned due
to conditions beyond the aviation supplier s control.      The equipment to be supplied by the Postal Service for this function will be
listed in  Attachment 6:   Postal Furnished Property , and will be covered by Clause 2-22,  Postal Service Property .  Attachment 6: Postal Furnished Property  will be created upon successful installation of the equipment. Upon
reasonable advance notice to the aviation supplier, the Postal Service shall be permitted to perform maintenance on any of the equipment located in an aviation supplier s facility listed in  Attachment 6: Postal Service Furnished
Property .       Fuel Adjustment    
  There will be a monthly fuel adjustment to the Fuel Line Haul rate. Each  month  is defined in  Attachment 1: Postal Service Operating
Periods . The adjustment will become effective on the first operating day of each operating period after contract commencement. The adjustment may be upward or downward.      The adjustment will be based on the U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) prices for Kerosene-type jet fuel reported by the U.S. Department of Energy for the month that is two (2) months prior to the adjustment.
The adjustment will be calculated and applied monthly.      For example, assume the Fuel Line Haul rate is $0.10. If the June 20XX USGC price
for Kerosene-type jet fuel is $2.68 per gallon and the July 20XX price is $3.00 per gallon, then the adjustment for September XX would be calculated as follows:      ($3.00 / $2.68) = 1.12      1.12 x $0.10 = $0.11   
  The new Fuel Line Haul rate would be $0.11 per cubic foot.      In August 20XX, if the USGC price is $2.70 per gallon, the calculation for the October 20XX rate would be:      ($2.70 / $3.00) = 0.90      0.90 x $0.11 = $0.10 per cubic foot   
  This calculation will be rounded after the decimal to four digits.      The proposal pricing should be based on the August 2012 U.S. Gulf Coast Kerosene-type jet fuel reported by the U.S. Department of Energy ($3.156 per gallon).   
  Fuel will be adjusted for October 2013 based on the August 2013 U.S. Gulf Coast Kerosene-type jet fuel reported by the U.S. Department of Energy.

     Payment Processing - Night Network - Per Pound     
   Invoicing       All Handling Units tendered to
the aviation supplier for the Night Network will be paid by the pound and payment will be based on required scanning. The weight will be derived from the assigned rounded weight of the Handling Unit. The Non-Fuel Line Haul rate will include all of
the transportation and handling associated with a Handling Unit. The Fuel Line Haul rate for the Night Network will not be subject to a fuel adjustment.       Re-Labeling Charge       The Postal Service will pay an additional charge to the aviation
supplier for re-labeling Postal Service Handling Units for which the D R tag is missing or becomes illegible. The Postal Service will also provide all equipment necessary to perform this function. The re-labeling charge per Handling Unit is
shown in  Attachment 10: Pricing.  This rate will not be subject to an increase for the full term of the contract.      Payment to the
aviation supplier for transport of re-labeled Handling Units will be based upon data received from the Hub Scan plus (combined and matched with) the Delivery Scan for the Handling Unit. An average weight per Handling Unit will be established based
upon the previous month s data for average weight per Handling Unit and for Handling Units that are not properly scanned due to conditions beyond the aviation supplier s control.      The equipment to be supplied by the Postal Service for this function will be listed in  Attachment 6:   Postal Furnished Property , and will be covered by Clause 2-22,  Postal Service
Property .  Attachment 6  will be created upon successful installation of the equipment. Upon reasonable advance notice to the aviation supplier, the Postal Service shall be permitted to perform maintenance on any of the equipment located in
an aviation supplier s facility listed in  Attachment 6 .      The payment for the Night Network re-labeled Handling Units will be
adjusted to reflect the percentage of re-labeled Handling Units that have already been scanned. This percentage of previously scanned Handling Units will be mutually agreed upon by the Postal Service and the aviation supplier through an audit
sampling of re-labeled Handling Units. Contingency Handling Units are excluded from this adjustment.        Reconciliation Process
       Reconciliation of scanning and payment records between the Postal Service and the aviation supplier will be conducted in a scheduled
meeting attended by the Postal Service and the aviation supplier on an Operating Period basis not more than ninety (90) days after the close of an Operating Period, or a time frame as agreed mutually by the parties. The following procedures
will be observed for the reconciliation process:       

a.  
  All data exchanges between the aviation supplier and the Postal Service for the reconciliation process will be performed electronically and sent to specified mailboxes
operated by each organization. Each file will have an individually specified transmission interval.         

b.  
  For all files exchanged between the aviation supplier and the Postal Service, any changes to layout or data definition must be communicated to the receiving party at a
minimum of sixty (60) calendar days prior to implementation, or sooner if mutually agreed.         

c.  
  All file transfers must adhere to Postal Service Security and Privacy rules.     

d.  
  Supplemental Charges / Assessments may be assessed each Operating Period. The charges shall include but not be limited to the following:     

i.  
  Operating Period Volume Minimum and Contract Volume Minimum     
         Page 29 of 101

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 1: Statement of Work          

ii.  
  Non-achievement of performance standards         

e.  
  Once the parties have mutually agreed on the Operating Period reconciliation, both parties agree that neither can re-open the Operating Period for further adjustments.
By mutually agreeing to the Operating Period reconciliation, the parties thereby agree to waive their right to pursue a claim under the Contract Disputes Act based upon the Operating Period reconciliation.     
  In the event there is a catastrophic equipment or information system failure, the aviation supplier will provide electronic files to the Postal Service
identifying all D R Tags the aviation supplier scanned that were lost. The aviation supplier will notify the Contracting Officer and the COR as soon as the aviation supplier becomes aware of such a failure.   
  If the Postal Service cannot produce D R Tags, an emergency contingency will be developed and implemented. Such a plan will include specifications
for operational and information technology issues, as well as payment.

a.  
  Classification of Irregularities     
  The following classifications of irregularities are those that preclude the Postal Service from accomplishing its mission. The damage
caused from these irregularities result in actual damage and degradation to its brand, and therefore, is associated with liquidated damages as stated:       

1.  
  Failure to Protect        Failure to
protect the mail consists of: failure to protect or safeguard the mail from inclement weather, from damage caused by the mechanized sort, from acts of the aviation supplier s employees or contractors, and from loss, depredation, or other
hazards while in the control or custody of the aviation supplier.       

2.  
  Theft of Mail        The theft of
mail can cause immeasurable damage to the Postal Service, both in terms of actual economic loss to our customers and to the competitive standing of our products and services. The aviation supplier will support law enforcement efforts to prevent
theft of mail, and will support enforcement officials in the apprehension of those who may be perpetrating such crimes.       

b.  
  Damages and Liquidated Damages     
  The following liquidated damages for damaged and unprotected mail are applicable to the associated classifications of irregularities:

1.  
  Damaged and Unprotected Mail     
  Liquidated damages may be assessed for damaged and unprotected mail. For purposes of this section, damaged mail will consist of mail
pieces whether inside or outside of Postal Service MTE. This category includes but may not be limited to:       

i.  
  Failure to Protect   Causing Damage to Mail        Failure to protect causing physical damage to the U.S. Mail or MTE for which there may be damage assessed equal to the actual costs incurred by the Postal Service necessary to remedy the situation and
forward the mail onward to its next processing or delivery operation. Such actual costs may include items such as administrative time at an appropriate hourly rate for documenting the irregular condition and implementing the damage, labor time used
to repossess the mail, unpack, sort, dry, repack / repackage, and re-dispatch to a subsequent destination or processing operation.      If actual damages are not ascertainable, a liquidated damage may be assessed as follows, taking into account the actual damage that may typically result from such situations:   

Per Letter Tray:  
      
  [ * ] per letter tray   
 
  Per Flat Tub:  
      
  [ * ] per flat tub   
 
  Per Mail Sack or Pouch:  
      
  [ * ] per sack or pouch   
 
  Per Outside Parcel:  
      
  [ * ] per piece   

*  
  Blank spaces contained confidential information which has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses              

ii.  
  Failure to Protect   Dropped or Abandoned Pouch or Piece        When U.S. Mail is discovered unprotected in an unsecured location or on the airport ramp, Liquidated Damages may be assessed at $50.00 per incident.   

c.  
  Investigative Costs for Theft of Mail        In cases where a mail theft is committed by the aviation supplier s or its subcontractor s personnel, actual investigative costs to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and/or the Office of the
Inspector General may be assessed as actual damages. These costs will be reasonably determined and may begin accruing only when a specific investigation begins on the basis of probable cause. The costs of routine surveillance not associated with a
specific theft or series of thefts will not be assessed. In addition to allocable investigative expenses, the Postal Service may assess actual damages for loss of product value resulting from insurance claims where payouts to postal customers can be
traced to the incident(s).      In addition to the above, in cases where mail theft occurs and the Postal Service determines that
the aviation supplier s failure to properly execute the mail handling employee screening requirements set forth in the Contract was a proximate cause of the theft, and that by reason of the theft it is necessary to conduct a complete audit of
the aviation supplier s adherence to the screening requirements with respect to the employment of other employees subject to those requirements, the Postal Service may assess an administrative damage in the amount of $5,000 in lieu of actual
costs associated with that audit.      Depending upon the circumstances of the incident, the Vice President, Network Operations, in
consultation with the Postal Inspection Service or Office of the Inspector General, and the Contracting Officer, may determine that damages pursuant to this section are not appropriate, and may waive all or a portion of the amounts that may
otherwise be due the Postal Service hereunder. Factors such as the seriousness of the misconduct, the aviation supplier s level of cooperation in investigations, implementing corrective actions, and efforts directed at loss recovery will be
considered in reaching that determination.        Clause B-80: Laws and Regulations Applicable (March 2006) (Tailored)     
  This contract and the services performed under it are subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The aviation supplier
assumes sole responsibility to faithfully discharge all duties and obligations imposed by such laws and regulations, and shall obtain and pay for all permits, licenses, and other authorities required to perform this contract. The aviation supplier
shall hold harmless, save, and defend the Postal Service from any consequence of the aviation supplier s failure to abide by all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations (including but not limited to regulations promulgated by
the DOL and IRS) relating to the contract and throughout the term of the contract and any subsequent renewal periods.        Clause B-81:
Information or Access by Third Parties (March 2006) (Tailored)        The Postal Service retains exclusive authority to release any or all
information about mail matter in the custody of the aviation supplier and to permit access to that mail in the custody of the aviation supplier. All requests by non-postal individuals for information about mail matter in the custody of the aviation
supplier or for access to mail in the custody of the aviation supplier must be referred to the Contracting Officer or his or her designee.   
    Clause B-82: Access by Officials (March 2006) (Tailored)        The aviation supplier shall deny access to the cargo compartment of aircrafts or a vehicle containing mail therein to state or local officials except at a postal facility or in the presence of a postal
employee or a Postal Inspection Service officer, unless to prevent immediate damage to the aircraft, vehicle, or their contents. If authorized Federal law enforcement seeks access to the cargo compartment of

vehicle, or their contents.        Clause 1-1: Privacy Protection (July 2007)        In addition to other provisions of this contract, the aviation supplier agrees to the following:       

a.  
   Privacy Act . If the aviation supplier operates a system of records on behalf of the Postal Service, the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 522a) and Postal Service

the name of an individual or by some number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual. The aviation supplier agrees to comply with the Act and the Postal Service regulations in designing, developing, and operating the system of
records, including ensuring that records are current and accurate for their intended use, and incorporating adequate safeguards to prevent misuse or improper disclosure of personal information. Violations of the Act may subject the violator to
criminal penalties.

2.  
   Use, Ownership, and Nondisclosure . The aviation supplier may use Postal Service customer or employee information solely for purposes of this contract, and may
not collect or use such information for non-Postal Service marketing, promotion, or any other purpose without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. The aviation supplier must restrict access to such information to those employees
who need the information to perform work under this contract, and must ensure that each such employee (including subcontractors  employees) sign a nondisclosure agreement, in a form suitable to the Contracting Officer, prior to being granted
access to the information. The Postal Service retains sole ownership and rights to its customer or employee information. Unless the contract states otherwise, upon completion of the contract, the aviation supplier must turn over all Postal Service
customer or employee information in its possession to the Postal Service, and must certify that no Postal Service customer or employee information has been retained unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer.

3.  
   Security Plan . When applicable, and unless waived in writing by the Contracting Officer, the aviation supplier must work with the Postal Service to develop and
implement a security plan that addresses the protection of customer or employee information. The plan will be incorporated into the contract and followed by the aviation supplier, and must, at a minimum, address notification to the Postal Service of
any security breach. If the contract does not include a security plan at the time of contract award, it must be added within 60 days after contract award.         

4.  
   Breach Notification . If there is a breach of any nature in the security of Postal Service data, including customer or employee data, the aviation supplier must
follow the breach notification requirements included in the security plan discussed in (3) above. The aviation supplier will be required to follow Postal Service policies regarding breach notification to customers and/or employees.

   Online Assistance . If the aviation supplier assists in the design, development, or operation of a Postal Service customer Web site, or if it designs or places an
ad banner, button, or link on a Postal Service Web site or any Web site on the Postal Service s behalf, the aviation supplier must comply with the limitations in subparagraph b (1) above relating to ad banners, buttons, or links, and the
use of cookies, web beacons, or other web analysis tools. Exceptions to these limitations require the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer and the Postal Service s chief privacy officer.     

d.  
   Marketing E-Mail . If the aviation supplier assists the Postal Service in conducting a marketing e-mail campaign, the aviation supplier does so as an agent of the
Postal Service and must adhere to the Postal Service policies set out in Postal Service Management Instruction AS-350-2004-4, Marketing E-mail. Aviation suppliers wishing to conduct marketing email campaigns to postal employees must first obtain the
prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.         

e.  
   Audits . The Postal Service may audit the aviation supplier s compliance with the requirements of this clause, including through the use of online compliance
software.         

f.

of this clause.         

g.  
   Flow-down . The aviation supplier will flow this clause down to subcontractors that would be covered by any portion of this clause if they were the aviation
supplier.          Clause 1-5: Gratuities or Gifts (March 2006)

Service-furnished property ).         

2.  
  The contract delivery or performance dates are based on the expectation that Postal Service-furnished property suitable for use (except for property furnished  as

  In the event of any decrease in or substitution of property pursuant to subparagraph b.1 above, or any withdrawal of authority to use property provided under any other
contract or lease, which property the Postal Service had agreed in the Schedule to make available for the performance of this contract, the Contracting Officer, upon the aviation supplier s written request (or - if substitution causes a

replacement for which the Postal Service is responsible, and an equitable adjustment will be made in any contractual provisions affected by such repair or replacement made at the direction of the Postal Service, in accordance with the Changes
clause. Any repair or replacement for which the aviation supplier is responsible under the provisions of this contract must be accomplished by the aviation supplier at the aviation supplier s own expense.

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses               Clause 9-2: Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act - Overtime Compensation (March 2006)         

a.  
  No aviation supplier or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work may require or permit any laborer or mechanic to work more than 40 hours in any
workweek on work subject to the provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, unless the laborer or mechanic receives compensation at a rate not less than one-and-one-half times the laborer s or mechanic s basic rate of
pay for all such hours worked in excess of 40 hours.         

b.  
   Violation, Liability for Unpaid Wages, and Liquidated Damages . In the event of any violation of paragraph a above, the aviation supplier and any subcontractor
responsible for the violation are liable to any affected employee for unpaid wages. The aviation supplier and subcontractor are also liable to the Postal Service for liquidated damages, which will be computed for each laborer or mechanic at $10 for
each day on which the employee was required or permitted to work in violation of paragraph a above.         

c.  
   Withholding for Unpaid Wages and Liquidated Damages . The Contracting Officer may withhold from the aviation supplier, from any moneys payable to the aviation
supplier or subcontractor under this or any other contract with the same aviation supplier, or any other federally assisted contract subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act held by the same aviation supplier, sums as may
administratively be determined necessary to satisfy any liabilities of the aviation supplier or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages pursuant to paragraph b above.     

d.  
   Records . The aviation supplier or subcontractor must maintain for 3 years from the completion of the contract for each laborer and mechanic (including watchmen
and guards) working on the contract payroll records which contain the name, address, social security number, and classification(s) of each such employee, hourly rates of wages paid, number of daily and weekly hours worked, deductions made, and
actual wages paid. The aviation supplier or subcontractor must make these records available for inspection, copying, or transcription by authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer and the Department of Labor, and must permit such
representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job. (The Department of Labor information collection and record keeping requirements in this paragraph d have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control
numbers 1215-0140 and 1215-0017.)         

e.  
   Subcontracts . The aviation supplier must insert paragraphs a through d of this clause in all subcontracts, and must require their inclusion in all subcontracts
at any tier.          Clause 9-7: Equal Opportunity (March 2006) (Tailored)     
  During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows:   

1.  
  The contractor may not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The contractor will take
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following:
Employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in
conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the Contracting Officer setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.     

2.  
  The contractor, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive
consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.         

3.  
    The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or
understanding, a notice, provided by the      
         Page 54 of

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses             
agency Contracting Officer, advising the labor union or workers  representative of the contractor s commitments under section 202 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965,
and must post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.       

4.  
  The contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order (EO) 11246 of September 24, 1965, as amended, and of the rules, regulations, and relevant orders
of the Secretary of Labor.         

5.  
  The contractor will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order, 11246 of September 24, 1964, and by the rules, regulations, and orders of the
Secretary of Labor, or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to his books, records, and accounts by the contracting agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations, and orders.

6.  
  In the event of the contractor s non-compliance with the non-discrimination clauses of this contract or with any of such rules, regulations, or orders, this
contract may be canceled, terminated, or suspended, in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and
such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.     

7.  
  The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7) in every subcontract or purchase order under this contract unless exempted by rules,
regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with
respect to any subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance,  provided ,  however , that in the event the contractor becomes
involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interest of the United States.
         Clause 9-9: Equal Opportunity Preaward Compliance of Subcontracts (March 2006) (Tailored)     
  The aviation supplier may not enter into a first-tier subcontract for an estimated or actual amount of $1 million or more without obtaining in writing
from the Contracting Officer a clearance that the proposed subcontractor is in compliance with equal opportunity requirements and therefore eligible for award.        Clause 9-10: Service Contract Act (March 2006)         

a.  
  This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended (41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.), and to the following provisions and all other applicable provisions of
the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor issued under the Act (29 CFR Part 4).         

b.  

1)  
  Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the aviation supplier or any subcontractor must be: a) paid not less than the minimum monetary
wages and b) furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor or an authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses              

a)  
  If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contracting Officer must require that any class of service employees not listed in it and to be employed under
the contract (that is, the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) be classified by the aviation supplier so as to provide a reasonable relationship (that is, appropriate level of skill
comparison) between the unlisted classifications and the classifications in the wage determination. The conformed class of employees must be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits determined under this clause. (The information
collection requirements contained in this paragraph b have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)         

b)  
  The conforming procedure must be initiated by the aviation supplier before the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees. A written report of the
proposed conforming action, including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved or, if there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves, must be submitted by the
aviation supplier to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employees performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer must review the proposed action and promptly submit a report of it, together with the
agency s recommendation and all pertinent information, including the position of the aviation supplier and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. Within 30 days
of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action, render a final determination in the event of disagreement, or notify the Contracting Officer that additional time is necessary.     

c)  
  The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division will be transmitted to the Contracting Officer, who must promptly notify the aviation
supplier of the action taken. The aviation supplier must give each affected employee a written copy of this determination, or it must be posted as a part of the wage determination.     

d)  

i.  
  The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates bearing a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single
formula. The approach used may vary from determination to determination, depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices ranking various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job
factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way various jobs are rated under federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same
locality. Basic to the establishment of conformable wage rates is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications on the basis of the skill required and the duties performed.

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses              

ii.  
  If a contract is modified or extended or an option is exercised, or if a contract succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously
conformed pursuant to this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (that is, adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average
(mean) percentage increase change in the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract that are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the
previously applicable wage determination. If these conforming actions are accomplished before the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the aviation supplier must advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken, but the
other procedures in b.2(c) above need not be followed.         

iii.  
  No employee engaged in performing work on this contract may be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended.         

e)  
  The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined pursuant to b.2(a) and (b) above must be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first
day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date the class
of employees began contract work is a violation of the Service Contract Act and this contract.         

f)  
  Upon discovery of failure to comply with b.2(a) through (e) above, the Wage and Hour Division will make a final determination of conformed classification, wage
rate, and / or fringe benefits that will be retroactive to the date the class of employees commenced contract work.         

3)  
  If, as authorized pursuant to section 4(d) of the Service Contract Act, the term of this contract is more than one year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits
required to be paid or furnished to service employees will be subject to adjustment after one year and not less often than once every two years, pursuant to wage determinations to be issued by the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards
Administration of the Department of Labor.         

c.  
  The aviation supplier or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined conformably to it by furnishing
any equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential payments in cash in accordance with the applicable rules set forth in Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4, and not otherwise.     

d.  

1)  
  In the absence of a minimum-wage attachment for this contract, neither the aviation supplier nor any subcontractor under this contract may pay any person performing
work under the contract (regardless of whether they are service employees) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this provision relieves the aviation supplier or any subcontractor
of any other obligation under law or contract for the payment of a higher wage to any employee.

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses              

a)  
  If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Service Contract Act, under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality, and service
employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the aviation
supplier nor any subcontractor under this contract may pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not the employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits
provided for in the agreement, to which the employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under the
agreement.         

b)  
  No aviation supplier or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of section 4.1(b) of 29 CFR Part 4 apply or
unless the Secretary of Labor or an authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in section 4.10 of 29 CFR Part 4, that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in the agreement vary substantially from those prevailing for
services of a similar character in the locality, or determines, as provided in section 4.11 of 29 CFR Part 4, that the agreement applicable to service employees under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm s-length
negotiations.         

c)  
  If it is found in accordance with the review procedures in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that wages and/or fringe benefits in a predecessor aviation
supplier s collective bargaining agreement vary substantially from those prevailing for services of a similar character in the locality, and/or that the agreement applicable to service employees under the predecessor contract was not entered
into as a result of arm s-length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. This determination will be made part of the contract or subcontract, in
accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Board of Service Contract Appeals, as the case may be, irrespective of whether its issuance occurs before or after award (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case
of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, it will be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision.     

e.  
  The aviation supplier and any subcontractor under this contract must notify each service employee starting work on the contract of the minimum monetary wage and any
fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to the contract, or must post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) must be posted in a prominent and accessible place at
the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)     

f.  
  The aviation supplier or subcontractor may not permit services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions
provided by or under the control or supervision of the aviation supplier or subcontractor that are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees engaged to furnish these services, and the aviation supplier or
subcontractor must comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925.

g.  

1)  
  The aviation supplier and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act must maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work records containing the
information specified in (a) through (f) following for each employee subject to the Service Contract Act and must make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment
Standards Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor (approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control numbers 1215-0017 and 1215-0150):     

a)  
  Name, address, and social security number of each employee.         

b)  
  The correct work classification, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of fringe benefit payments in lieu thereof, and total
daily and weekly compensation of each employee.         

c)  
  The number of daily and weekly hours so worked by each employee.         

d)  
  Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.     

e)  
  A list of monetary wages and fringe benefits for those classes of service employees not included in the wage determination attached to this contract but for whom wage
rates or fringe benefits have been determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative pursuant to paragraph b above. A copy of the report required by b.2(b) above is such a list.     

f)  
  Any list of the predecessor aviation supplier s employees furnished to the aviation supplier pursuant to section 4.6(1)(2) of 29 CFR Part 4.

2)  
  The aviation supplier must also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.

3)  
  Failure to make and maintain or to make available the records specified in this paragraph g for inspection and transcription is a violation of the regulations and this
contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification of the aviation supplier, must take action to suspend any further payment or advance of funds until
the violation ceases.         

4)  
  The aviation supplier must permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working
hours.         

h.  
  The aviation supplier must unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Service Contract Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction
(except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. Payments must be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay
period under the Act may not be of any duration longer than semimonthly.         

i.  
    The Contracting Officer must withhold or cause to be withheld from the Postal Service aviation supplier under this or any other contract with the
aviation supplier such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the aviation supplier or subcontractor. In the event of failure to
pay employees subject to the Act wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Postal Service may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the aviation supplier, suspend any further

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses          

payment or advance of funds until the violations cease. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the
contract work. In this event, the Postal Service may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the aviation supplier in default with any additional cost.     

j.  
  The aviation supplier agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. The term  aviation supplier,  as used in this clause in any
subcontract, is deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term  aviation supplier.          

k.  
  Service employee means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional
capacity, as those terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29,  Code of Federal Regulations , as of July 30, 1976, and any subsequent revision of those regulations. The term includes all such persons regardless of any contractual
relationship that may be alleged to exist between an aviation supplier or subcontractor and them.         

l.  

1)  
  If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished service employees employed by the aviation supplier or a subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a
collective bargaining agreement that is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the aviation supplier must report this fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and
accrual of these wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and furnish a copy of the agreement. The report must be made upon starting performance of the contract, in the
case of collective bargaining agreements effective at the time. In the case of agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance, they must be reported promptly after their
negotiation. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)         

2)  
  Not less than 10 days before completion of any contract being performed at a Postal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of a succeeding
contract and subject to a wage determination containing vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a aviation supplier (predecessor) or successor (section 4.173 of Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), the incumbent aviation
supplier must furnish to the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the aviation supplier s or subcontractor s payroll during the last month of contract performance. The list must also contain
anniversary dates of employment on the contract, either with the current or predecessor aviation suppliers of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer must turn over this list to the successor aviation supplier at the commencement of the
succeeding contract. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1215-0150.)         

m.  
  Rulings and interpretations of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4.     

n.  

1)  
  By entering into this contract, the aviation supplier and its officials certify that neither they nor any person or firm with a substantial interest in the aviation
supplier s firm are ineligible to be awarded government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed pursuant to section 5 of the Act.         

2)  
  No part of this contract may be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a government contract pursuant to section 5 of the Act.

  The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.     

o.  
  Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and
exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act before its amendment by Public Law 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of government business:

1)  
  Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, or physical or mental deficiency or injury may be employed at wages lower than the
minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Service Contract Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and
procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator
(29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).         

2)  
  The Administrator will issue certificates under the Service Contract Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped
clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two Acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe
benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).     

3)  
  The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in Parts 525 and 528 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal
Regulations.         

p.  
  Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide
apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a state, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, Employment
and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee not registered as an apprentice in an approved program must be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman
classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices may not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman s rate
contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification may not be greater than the ratio permitted to the aviation supplier for its entire workforce
under the registered program.         

q.  
  An employee engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month tips may have the amount of tips credited by the
employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of this credit may not exceed $1.24 per
hour beginning January 1, 1980, and $1.34 per hour after December 31, 1980. To utilize this proviso:         

1)  
  The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized;

101  

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses              

2)  
  The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips
received);         

3)  
  The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct
wages and tip credit (approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 1214-0017); and         

4)  
  The use of tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act.

r.  
  Disputes arising out of the labor standards provisions of this contract are not subject to the  Claims and Disputes  clause but must be resolved in accordance with
the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR Parts 4, 6, and 8. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the aviation supplier (or any of its subcontractors) and the Postal Service, the U.S. Department of
Labor, or the employees or their representatives.          Clause 9-12: Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act - Price
Adjustment (February 2010)         

a.  
  The aviation supplier warrants that the contract prices do not include allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for which adjustment is provided under
this clause.         

b.  
  The minimum prevailing wage determination, including fringe benefits, issued under the Service Contract Act of 1965 by the Department of Labor (DOL), current at least
every two years after the original award date, current at the beginning of any option or renewal period, or in the case of a significant change in labor requirements, applies to this contract and any exercise of an option or renewal of this
contract. When no such determination has been made as applied to this contract, the minimum wage established in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to any exercise of an option or renewal of this contract.     

c.  
  When, as a result of the determination of minimum prevailing wages and fringe benefits applicable (1) every two years after original award date, (2) at the
beginning of any option or renewal period, or (3) in the case of a significant change in labor requirements, an increased or decreased wage determination is applied to this contract, or when as a result of any amendment to the Fair Labor
Standards Act enacted after award that affects minimum wage, and whenever such a determination becomes applicable to this contract under law, the aviation supplier increases or decreases wages or fringe benefits of employees working on the contract
to comply, the aviation supplier and the Contracting Officer will negotiate whether and to what extent either party will absorb the costs of the wage change. Any resulting change in contract price is limited to increases or decreases in wages or
fringe benefits, and the concomitant increases or decreases in Social Security, unemployment taxes, and workers  compensation insurance, but may not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.

d.  
  The aviation supplier or Contracting Officer may request a contract price adjustment within 30 days of the effective date of a wage change. If a request for contract
price adjustment has been made, and the parties have not reached an agreement within thirty days of that request, the Contracting Officer should issue a unilateral change order in the amount considered to be a fair and equitable adjustment. The
aviation supplier may then either accept the amount, or the aviation supplier may file a claim under Clause B-9:  Claims and Disputes  unless the Contracting Officer and aviation supplier extend this period in writing. Upon agreement of the
parties, the contract price or unit price labor rates will be modified in writing. Pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date, the aviation supplier must continue performance.

  The contractor must include the provisions of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order in excess of $10,000, unless exempted by the rules, regulations, or
orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to section 503 of the Act, as amended, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs may direct to enforce such provisions, including action for noncompliance.          Clause 9-14: Equal Opportunity for Disabled Veterans, Recently Separated Veterans, Other Protected Veterans, and Armed Forces Service Medal Veterans (February 2010) (Tailored)     

a.  
  The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because he or she is a disabled veteran, recently separated veteran, other

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses              

c.  
  Listing of employment openings with the appropriate employment service delivery system pursuant to this clause shall be made at least concurrently with the use of any
other recruitment source or effort and shall involve the normal obligations which attach to the placing of a  bona fide  job order, including the acceptance of referrals of veterans and nonveterans. The listing of employment openings does not
require the hiring of any particular job applicants or from any particular group of job applicants, and nothing herein is intended to relieve the contractor from any requirements in Executive orders or regulations regarding nondiscrimination in
employment.         

d.  
  Whenever a contractor, other than a state or local governmental contractor, becomes contractually bound to the listing provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this clause,
it shall advise the state workforce agency in each state where it has establishments of the name and location of each hiring location in the state. As long as the contractor is contractually bound to these provisions and has so advised the state
agency, there is no need to advise the state agency of subsequent contracts. The contractor may advise the state agency when it is no longer bound by this contract clause.     

e.  
  The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this clause do not apply to the listing of employment openings which occur and are filled outside of the 50 states, the District
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Wake Island, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands.     

f.  
  As used in this clause:         

1.  
   All employment openings  includes all positions except executive and senior management, those positions that will be filled from within the contractor s
organization, and positions lasting three days or less. This term includes full-time employment, temporary employment of more than three days  duration, and part-time employment.     

2.  
   Executive and senior management  means: (1) Any employee (a) compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week (or $380 per week,
if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities; (b) whose primary duty is management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or of a customarily
recognized department or subdivision thereof; (c) who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees; and (d) who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to
the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight; or (2) any employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity interest in the enterprise in which the employee is
employed, regardless of whether the business is a corporate or other type of organization, and who is actively engaged in its management.         

3.  
   Positions that will be filled from within the contractor s organization  means employment openings for which no consideration will be given to persons
outside the contractor s organization (including any affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies) and includes any openings which the contractor proposes to fill from regularly established  recall  lists. The exception does not
apply to a particular opening once an employer decides to consider applicants outside of his or her own organization.         

g.  
  The contractor agrees to comply with the rules, regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to the Act.

h.  
  In the event of the contractor s noncompliance with the requirements of this clause, actions for noncompliance may be taken in accordance with the rules,
regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to the Act.         

i.  
  The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices in a form to be prescribed by the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance, provided by or through the Contracting Officer. Such notices shall state the rights of applicants and employees as well as the contractor s obligation under the law to take affirmative action to employ
and advance in employment qualified employees and applicants who are disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, other protected veterans, or Armed Forces service medal veterans. The contractor must ensure that applicants or employees who are
disabled veterans are informed of the contents of the notice (e.g., the contractor may have the notice read to a visually disabled individual, or may lower the posted notice so that it might be read by a person in a wheelchair).

j.  
  The contractor will notify each labor organization or representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract understanding,
that the contractor is bound by the terms of the Vietnam Era Veterans  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, and is committed to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified disabled veterans, recently
separated veterans, other protected veterans, and Armed Forces service medal veterans.         

k.  
  The contractor will include the provisions of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order of $100,000 or more, unless exempted by the rules, regulations, or
orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to the Vietnam Era Veterans  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect
to any subcontract or purchase order as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance may direct to enforce such provisions, including action for noncompliance.          Contract Term        The contract base period of performance will be October 1, 2013,
through September 30, 2020, with two, five year renewal periods to be exercised by mutual agreement of the parties. The Night Network will begin operation on September 30, 2013; the Day Network will begin operation on October 1, 2013.

]        Amendments or Modifications        In order to be binding upon the Postal Service or the aviation supplier, any amendment or modification of this Contract must be in writing signed by the Contracting Officer on behalf of the Postal Service
and an officer of the aviation supplier authorized to bind the company.        Assignment     
  Neither Party shall, directly or indirectly (whether by succession, merger, or otherwise) assign, delegate, novate, or otherwise transfer this Contract or
any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written approval of the other. However, the aviation supplier may assign this contract to any of its internal business affiliates upon written notice to the Postal Service.

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses               Force Majeure        Both the Postal Service and the aviation supplier shall be excused
from their obligations for volume guarantees or service performance, respectively, under this Contract, and neither Party shall be liable to the other or any other person or entity for loss, damage, delay, mis-delivery or non-delivery of shipments
transported pursuant to this Contract, resulting in whole or in part from any of the following:       

a.  
  When there occurs a State or Federal government-declared State of Emergency and / or instructions by a government agency that has actual or apparent powers or authority
(including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)) to order airport closures or limitations on airport activity;     

b.  
  When the failure to meet contractual obligations results in whole or in part from public enemies, terrorist acts, criminal acts of any person or entity, public
authorities acting with actual or apparent authority (including U.S. Postal Inspectors), civil commotion, hazards incident to a state of war, national disruptions in transportation networks or operations (of any mode) of the aviation supplier,
Postal Service, or any other entity, strikes, natural disasters, or disruption or failure of third-party communication and information systems; or         

c.  
  When there exist any conditions that present a danger to each Party s personnel.     

d.  
  In every case the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the party claiming that its performance is excused. Each Party is
required to continue and attempt to recommence performance to the greatest extent possible without delay.        It is the
responsibility of the Party asserting the Force Majeure event to formally declare that a Force Majeure event has taken place within twenty-four (24) hours of the event. The party declaring the Force Majeure event must document the circumstances
of the event in writing to the Contracting Officer, who will review the information with the Manager, Air Transportation Operations, and relevant aviation supplier officials. In the absence of a formal request for relief under this clause, all
appropriate volume guarantees and performance standards will remain in force. Except for the calculation of the service levels, nothing in this section shall relieve or excuse the aviation supplier of its service obligations. Subsequent to a Force
Majeure event being declared, the declaring party must provide reasonable, written documentation with sufficient detail to support the declaration.      If, as a result of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events, the aviation supplier is excused from performance, and the Postal Service is excused from meeting its minimum volume commitment for the
identified period, the Parties will meet to agree upon the pro-rata adjustments to be made.      On days where mail volume is withdrawn, withheld,
or not transported under this provision, the minimum volume commitment for the identified period will be reduced for that period by the amount of that volume.        Frequency Adjustment        If, during the term of this contract, the Postal Service
decides to reduce, in whole or in part, the number of delivery days, for any mail type it provides, to fewer than six (6) per week, the Postal Service reserves the right to effectuate a change in delivery days by adjusting the Statement of Work
of this contract, including, but not limited to, the annual number of operating days or the frequency of service hereunder. The parties agree that such an adjustment does not constitute a partial termination of the contract, nor will it give rise to
an equitable adjustment.      If the number of delivery days is reduced, in whole or in part, to five (5) and the Postal Service decides to
reduce the number of operating days under this contract, in whole or in part, to five (5), the parties agree to reduce the Contract Volume Minimum calculation. The Contract Volume Minimum calculation

101  

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses             
will be reduced by the average daily volume for the previous twelve (12) months excluding the weeks of Peak associated with the removed day of service without adjustment to the tier
structure, the contract rate, or be subject to any other price-related adjustment. The monies associated with the volume removed from the calculation will be eliminated.      If the number of delivery days is reduced to fewer than five (5), and the Postal Service decides to reduce the number of operating days under this contract, in whole or in part, to fewer than five (5),
the parties will negotiate an equitable adjustment if necessary.      No later than 120 days prior to the effective date of such reduction in
delivery days, the parties shall commence discussions as to how to implement the change. Within 90 days of such notice, the supplier must implement the changes outlined above.        Notices        Any notice, report, demand, acknowledgement or other communication which
under the terms of this Contract or otherwise must be given or made by either Party, unless specifically otherwise provided in this Contract, shall be in the English language and in writing, and shall be given or made by express delivery service
with proof of delivery, certified air mail (return receipt requested). The parties may also send a copy of the same communication through electronic mail, facsimile with acknowledgement of receipt/proof of receipt, or personal delivery. If a party
sends a copy of the official correspondence by electronic mail or facsimile, the correspondence shall not be deemed received until the receiving party confirms receipt.      Such notice, report, demand, acknowledgement or other communication shall be deemed to have been given or made in the case of express delivery service with tracking and tracing capability on the date of
signature of the proof of delivery, and in the case of certified mail on the fifth business day in the place of receipt after the date sent.   
  The notice address for the Postal Service shall be:      U.S. Postal Service      Air Transportation CMC   
  Attention: Manager      475 L Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P 650      Washington, DC 20260-0650   
  The notice address for the aviation supplier shall be:      Federal Express Corporation      Attention: Vice President, Postal Transportation

a.  
  If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Contract is held by a court or Board of competent jurisdiction or by a request, direction or indication of an
agency or department of a Governmental Body having subject matter jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions shall continue in full force and effect unless the rights and obligations of the parties have been
materially altered or abridged by such invalidation or unenforceability.         

b.  
  If a material provision of this Contract is materially altered or abridged as the result of a final and binding order of a Governmental Body having subject matter
jurisdiction, then the Postal Service and the aviation supplier will meet to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually satisfactory modification to this Contract. If the Parties are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, then either
Party may declare the negotiations to be at an impasse and the parties shall resolve the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this contract.

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Part 3: Contract Clauses              

c.  
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree to make their best efforts to oppose any changes requested by a Governmental Body to any material provision of this
Contract.          Third Party Governmental Delays        If, during the term of this contract, a governmental entity with subject matter jurisdiction enacts laws, promulgates regulations, or issues orders mandating that the aviation supplier screen mail
dispatched for transportation by aircraft within the United States for bombs, explosives, or other hazardous materials, and aviation supplier does not have a method for otherwise complying at no additional cost to the Postal Service, either party
may, at no cost to the other party, suspend performance under the contract during the period in which such screening is actually required to be accomplished.      Within fourteen (14) days of the enactment of any law, promulgation of any regulation, or issuance of any order referenced above, the parties shall commence negotiations in an attempt to modify this
contract to address any adverse impacts and / or other concerns asserted by one or both parties that may arise as a result of additional screening requirements.      If the parties cannot agree upon such a modification within 180 days, or within such longer period as the parties may mutually agree, the contract and all orders hereunder may be terminated at no cost to
either party.        Waiver of Breach        No waiver of breach of any of the provisions of this Contract shall be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provision.

   Attachment 8        Investigative / Security Protocol and Guidelines        U.S. Postal Inspection
Service        July 2012       This document contains a statement of principles which will be used by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service ( Inspection Service ) and the aviation supplier to address U.S. Mail investigations and
security matters related to contract ACN-13-FX ( the Agreement ) between the aviation supplier and the United States Postal Service ( the Postal Service ). This statement of principles is not intended to be all-inclusive but is
designed to provide a broad framework that will allow flexibility for the parties to accomplish their respective security and investigative missions. In no event should this statement of principles be construed as an expansion of the aviation
supplier s obligations or the Inspection Service s authority under any applicable law or regulation or to expand either party s rights or obligations under the Agreement. For purposes of this statement of principles, the term
 mail  shall hereinafter mean any item that is tendered to the aviation supplier by the Postal Service for transportation. This statement of principles is based on open communication and cooperation between the parties at each
organizational level to the fullest extent possible in postal-related matters.       Coordination    

1.  
  The local contact points for the coordination of any mail related investigations and security issues related to this agreement will be at the aviation supplier s

   Contract ACN-13-FX        Attachment 9: Wage Determination              Attachment 9        Wage Determination    
   October 31, 2012    
  Due to the size and complexity of this solicitation, it is impracticable to attach all relevant wage determinations to the solicitation packet. In lieu
of a physical attachment, the Postal Service has worked with the Department of Labor to provide instructions to potential contractors for accessing the wage determination(s) on the Department of Labor website. The instructions are as follows:
     Current wage determinations can be found at www.wdol.gov. This is the official Department of Labor website from which to access wage
determinations. To access wage determinations, enter the website and click  Selecting SCA WDs  under the column heading  Service Contract Act.  Use the drop down menu to select the state and county for the designated wage
determination, and then click  Continue.  Answer  No  for the question  Were these services previously performed at this locality under an SCA-covered contract?  Answer  No  for the question  Are the
contract services to be performed listed below as Non-Standard Services?  Click on the Printer Friendly Version for a full view and printable Wage Determination. Identify the SCA wage determination(s), including determination number, revision
date, and state and counties that were used to determine that the rates offered are in compliance  on Attachment 13: Service Contract Act Wage Determinations .* The revision numbers of the wage determinations listed in the solicitation index of
wage determinations should be used in the comparisons. For all the identified SCA eligible labor categories, map the SCA equivalent labor category title (titles/descriptions available at http://www.wdol.gov. Click on the  library  link,
then download the SCA Directory of Occupations, 5th Edition). Also identify the Wage Determination number that the labor categories in your offer are predicated. Note that the applicable revision number for all Wage Determination numbers is the
revision number identified in the solicitation index of wage determinations. In those instances where the aviation supplier has a non-standard classification (a standard wage does not fit the work category) that requires a special SCA wage
determination, the aviation supplier must contact the Postal Service Contracting Officer at:      Manager, Air
Transportation CMC      475 L  Enfant Plaza SW, Room 1P650   
  Washington, DC 20260-0650      Although the aviation supplier assumes sole responsibility to faithfully discharge all duties and obligations with regards to wage determinations imposed by the Department of Labor, the Postal Service
will assist the aviation supplier upon the aviation supplier s request, to the extent necessary, in selecting the appropriate wage determinations.      The aviation supplier should review the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations to confirm whether the positions the aviation supplier wishes to offer fit into the currently published occupation
titles under the wage determination. If the position will not fit into any of the currently published occupation titles, please review the instructions in the wage determination entitled  The process for preparing a conformance request. 
In accordance with the Department of Labor instructions (that can be found at www.wdol.gov) in each wage determination, entitled Conformance Process, any class of service employee that is not listed therein and that is to be employed under the
contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) must be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between
such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be
initiated by the contractor prior to the

Air Cargo Network    
   Contract ACN-13-FX        Attachment 9: Wage Determination             
performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the
contract.      * Given the desire of the offerors to seek additional information from the Department of Labor regarding the applicability of the
Service Contract Act to the contract(s) that may result from this solicitation, the completed submission of  Attachment 13: Service Contract Act Wage Determination  may be delayed until a mutually agreeable date prior to contract award. As a
condition of acceptance of the offeror s proposal(s), the offeror must explicitly state that the proposed pricing will hold firm irrespective of any determination made by the Department of Labor.

EXHIBIT 10.73         Compensation Arrangements with Named Executive Officers         Base Salaries
      The following table sets forth the annual base salaries of FedEx s named executive officers:   

Name and Current Position   
      
  Base Salary  

Frederick W. Smith  
   Chairman, President and   
   Chief Executive Officer    
      
  $  
  1,266,960  

Alan B. Graf, Jr.  
   Executive Vice President and   
   Chief Financial Officer    
      
  $  
  902,784  

David J. Bronczek  
   President and Chief Executive Officer   FedEx Express    
      
  $  
  942,096  

T. Michael Glenn  
   Executive Vice President,   
   Market Development and   
   Corporate Communications    
      
  $  
  833,364  

Robert B. Carter  
   Executive Vice President,   
   FedEx Information Services and   
   Chief Information Officer    
      
  $  
  762,960  
       
    Mr. Smith s base salary was effective as of July 16, 2011. The base salaries of the other
named executive officers were effective as of July 1, 2011. The named executive officers did not receive base salary increases for fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2014.       Fiscal 2014 Annual Incentive Compensation Program        Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer       Frederick W. Smith s fiscal 2014 annual bonus will be based on the achievement of
corporate objectives for operating income for fiscal 2014. The independent members of the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, may adjust Mr. Smith s bonus amount upward or downward based on their
annual evaluation of Mr. Smith s performance, including the quality and effectiveness of his leadership, the execution of key strategic initiatives and the following corporate performance measures:   

FedEx s stock price performance relative to the Standard   Poor s 500 Composite Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and competitors;      
         1   

FedEx s stock price to earnings (P/E) ratio relative to the Standard   Poor s 500 Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
and competitors;          

FedEx s market capitalization;          

FedEx s revenue and operating income growth (excluding certain unusual items) relative to competitors;      

FedEx s free cash flow (excluding business acquisitions), return on invested capital (excluding certain unusual items), and weighted average cost
of capital;          

Analyst coverage and ratings for FedEx s stock;          

FedEx s U.S. and international revenue market share; and      

FedEx s reputation rankings by various publications and surveys.         None of these factors will be given any particular weight in determining whether to adjust Mr. Smith s bonus amount.      Mr. Smith s annual bonus target for fiscal 2014 is 130% of his annual base salary (at fiscal year-end), with a maximum payout of 300% of his target bonus.   
   Non-CEO Named Executive Officers       The fiscal 2014 annual bonus target payouts for the non-CEO named executive officers, as a percentage of annual base salary (at fiscal year-end), are as follows:   
   
    The maximum payout for each executive is 240% of his target bonus.   
  The fiscal 2014 annual bonus for the non-CEO named executive officers will be based on the achievement of corporate objectives for
operating income for fiscal 2014. In prior years, a portion of the annual bonus for the non-CEO named executive officers was based on the achievement of individual performance objectives. For fiscal 2014, however, the entire annual bonus for the
non-CEO named executive officers will be based on company financial performance. Mr. Smith may adjust each officer s bonus amount downward based on the officer s achievement of individual performance objectives established at the
beginning of the fiscal year. Mr. Smith will determine the achievement level of each executive s individual objectives at the conclusion of fiscal 2014.   
         2   

Company Financial Performance Measure    
  The annual bonus payout opportunity for each named executive officer ranges, on a sliding scale, from a minimum amount if the annual bonus
plan s pre-established operating income threshold is achieved up to a maximum amount if such financial performance goal is substantially exceeded. Ordinarily, our business plan objective for the financial measure   operating income for
fiscal 2014   is the target under the annual bonus plan. For fiscal 2014, however, in order to further motivate management to improve the company s performance, the annual bonus plan s target objective for company financial
performance is higher than the business plan objective for operating income.        Long-Term Incentive Program     
  FedEx s long-term incentive ( LTI ) plans for the three-fiscal-year periods 2012 through 2014, 2013 through 2015 and 2014
through 2016 provide long-term cash bonus opportunities to members of upper management, including the named executive officers, upon the conclusion of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, if certain aggregate fully diluted earnings per share
( EPS ) goals established by the Board of Directors are achieved with respect to those periods. No amounts can be earned for the fiscal 2012 through 2014, 2013 through 2015 and 2014 through 2016 plans until 2014, 2015 and 2016,
respectively, because achievement of the EPS goals can only be determined following the conclusion of the applicable three-fiscal-year period.      The following table sets forth the potential future payouts to each of FedEx s named executive officers under FedEx s LTI plans:   

3   

The potential individual future payouts set forth in the table above are set dollar amounts
ranging from threshold (minimum) amounts, if the EPS goal achieved is less than target, up to maximum amounts, if the plan goal is substantially exceeded. There can be no assurance that the potential future payouts shown in this table will be
achieved.
