WAL-MART STORES, INC. 
  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K 
  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31,   2017    
  PART I 
   
                 ITEM 1. 
    BUSINESS 

General 
  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better   anytime and anywhere   in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities.  Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping and saves time for our customers.  Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each market where we operate.  Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.  Each week, we serve over   260 million   customers who visit our   11,695   stores under   59   banners in   28   countries and e-commerce websites in   11   countries. 
  Our strategy is to lead on price, differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.  Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP").  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Price leadership is core to who we are.  Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers.  Our digital and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.  We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. 
  Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2017   ("fiscal   2017  "),   January 31, 2016   ("fiscal   2016  ") and   January 31, 2015   ("fiscal   2015  ").  During fiscal   2017  , we generated total revenues of   $485.9 billion  , which was primarily comprised of net sales of   $481.3 billion  . 
  We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.  Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT." 
  The Development of Our Company 
  Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas.  In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. 
  In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico.  Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as of   January 31, 2017  , our Walmart International segment conducted business in   27   countries. 
  In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website.  Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow.  As of   January 31, 2017  , we operated e-commerce websites in   11   countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.

Information About Our Segments 
  The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and retail websites in the U.S. and 10 other countries.  The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. 
  Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail.  Walmart U.S. generated approximately   64%   of our net sales in fiscal   2017  , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate").  In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. 
  Walmart International consists of operations in   27   countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other.  These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs), cash   carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail.  Walmart International generated approximately   24%   of our fiscal   2017   net sales.  The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.  Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units. 
  Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 47 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail.  Sam's Club accounted for approximately   12%   of our fiscal   2017   net sales.  As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. 
  The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. 
   
  Walmart U.S. Segment 
  The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart," "Wal-Mart" and "Walmart Neighborhood Market" brands, as well as walmart.com and other digital retail.  The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of   $307.8 billion  ,   $298.4 billion   and   $288.0 billion   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company consolidated net sales. 
  Physical.   The Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all   50   states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in   49   states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in   41   states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in   31   states and Puerto Rico.  The following table provides square footage details on each of our formats as of   January 31, 2017  :

Competition.   The Walmart U.S. segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, dollar, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, e-commerce and catalog businesses.  We also compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated retail units.  
  Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry.  We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry.  These programs include the following: 
             
    EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; 
                
    EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; 
                
    Rollbacks: our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods; 
                
    Savings Catcher, Save Even More and Ad Match: strategies to meet or be below a competitor's advertised price; 
                
    Walmart Pickup: customer places order online and picks it up for free from a store.  The merchandise is fulfilled through our distribution facilities; 
                
    Pickup Today: customer places order online and picks it up at a store within four hours for free.  The order is fulfilled through existing store inventory; 
                
    Online Grocery: customer places grocery order online and has it delivered to home or picks it up at one of our participating stores or remote locations; and 
                
    Money Back Guarantee: our commitment to ensure the quality and freshness of the fruits and vegetables in our stores by offering our customers a 100 percent money-back guarantee if they are not satisfied. 
     We offer a broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that give our customers confidence that we will have the products they need and operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience.  In addition, our retail website and mobile commerce applications are important factors in our competition with other retailers, particularly e-commerce retailers. 
  Distribution.   For fiscal   2017  , approximately   78%   of the Walmart U.S. segment's purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our   147   distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S.  The remaining merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers.  General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet.  However, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. 
  We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our retail websites and through our mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers.

Walmart International Segment

These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash   carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail.  The segment's net sales for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , were   $116.1 billion  ,   $123.4 billion   and   $136.2 billion  , respectively, which have been impacted by unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations.  During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. 
  Physical.   Our Walmart International segment is comprised of physical stores operated by: our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom; and our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) and Mexico. 
  Generally, retail units range in size from   8,900   square feet to   185,000   square feet.  Our wholesale stores generally range in size from   35,000   square feet to   70,000   square feet.

              (2) 
    Other includes drug stores and convenience stores operating under varying banners.  
       Digital.   The Walmart International segment operates e-commerce websites in   10   countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom).  Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and, in countries where available, mobile commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country.  Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like "Click   Collect" in the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico. 
  Merchandise.   The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items.  Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You," and "Extra Special."  In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. 
  Operations.   The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation.  Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods. 
  Seasonal Aspects of Operations.   The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. 
  Competition.   The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the markets in which we operate.  We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations.  We compete with others for desirable sites.  Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates.  We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach.  Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.  In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in our digital and physical retail operations. 
  
    12 

Distribution.   We utilize a total of   176   distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment.  During fiscal   2017  , approximately   82%   of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities.  Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate.  The following table provides further details of our international distribution facilities, including 15 e-commerce dedicated fulfillment centers, as of December 31, 2016, with the exception of distribution facilities in Canada, which are stated as of   January 31, 2017  :

The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. 
  Competition.   Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco Wholesale, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, e-commerce and catalog businesses.  Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites.

The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized.  Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers.  Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. 
  Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.  The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.

  Other Segment Information 
  Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31,   2017   ("Annual Report to Shareholders") under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 14 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  Note 14 also includes information regarding total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations.  Such portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are included as    Exhibit 13    to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein as expressly provided herein. 
  Intellectual Property 
  We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights.  We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights.  Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.  We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. 
  Suppliers and Supply Chain 
  As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online.  In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category.  Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers.  Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws.  Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. 
  Employees 
  As of the end of fiscal   2017  , the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately   2.3 million   employees ("associates") worldwide, with nearly   1.5 million   associates in the U.S. and   0.8 million   associates internationally.  Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates and a large number of associates turn over each year.  We believe our relationships with our associates are good. 
  On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a significant initiative on pay and training for U.S. associates.  Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay raises in the first half of fiscal 2016, and in February 2016, approximately 1.2 million full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay increases.  Also included in the announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiring, training, compensation and scheduling programs, as well as to our store management structure.  These changes give our U.S. associates the opportunity to earn higher pay and advance in their careers. 
  Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 12 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
  In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance.  The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S.  The Company's medical plan in the U.S. has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses. 
  Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

                 ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. 
  Strategic Risks 
  General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.  Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. 
  In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. 
  The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. 
  We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. 
  It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns.  The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings.  Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products.  As a result of these factors, we  
  
    17 

plan to increase investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on comparable store sales and e-commerce for growth.  Any failure of these investments or initiatives to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. 
  We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  The retail business is highly competitive.  Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national and international internet-based retailers and retail intermediaries. 
  Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses.  Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, and e-commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. 
  Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash   carry operations, convenience stores and e-commerce and catalog businesses. 
  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased online, through mobile commerce applications or through the integration of our physical and digital retail operations. 
  Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale.  A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance.  See "   Item 1. Business   " above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. 
  Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace.  Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions.  Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Failure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing e-commerce investments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. 
  The retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications.  As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate.  We plan to increase our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and e-commerce sales (which are included in our calculation of comparable store and club sales with the exception of e-commerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for 12 months) for growth.  The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail channels and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this    Item 1A   . 
  Our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our e-commerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings.  If we fail to  successfully implement our strategy, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected.  In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations. 
  
    18 

In addition, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired e-commerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. 
  Operational Risks 
  Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. 
  Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. 
  These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012 or the numerous storm systems in the U.S. in recent years, and could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses.  Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages.  Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers.  Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance.  We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct.  Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.   
  Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.   
  In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.  These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. 
  If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance. 
  Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products.  Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is  
  
    19 

outside of our control.  Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish.  As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. 
  We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. 
  Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.  Our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates.  Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations.  If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim.  Any interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems.  The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe our change management process will mitigate this risk.  If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. 
  If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. 
  Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy.  Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping.  We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience.  As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer "Walmart Pickup," "Pickup Today" and "Club Pickup" and in a growing number of locations, "Online Grocery" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.  Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.  
  We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment.  Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
  Our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer systems and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired e-commerce businesses, may be subject to cyber-attacks.  Those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to the website or mobile commerce application to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below.  Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our retail websites or mobile commerce applications and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience on any of our retail website or mobile commerce applications.  If we are unable to maintain the security of our retail commerce websites and mobile commerce applications and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. 
  
    20 

Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. 
  As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors.  Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.  We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions.  Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors.  In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. 
  Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated.  Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single "hackers" or small groups of "hackers."  Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems.  We have in place substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, our information systems and the information stored on such systems.  We also have security processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers, including cloud service providers, to protect information from our systems which they have access to or hold under their engagements with us. 
  We constantly monitor developments in cyber threats, evaluate the effectiveness of our information security measures and change such measures or implement new and additional security measures from time to time to address new and different risks to the security of such information and to strengthen our protections for the information stored on our systems.  We require our third-party service providers to do the same.  Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors. 
  Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems.  Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security.  We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. 
  Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
  In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies.  Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations. 
  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications.  As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.  Even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future.  To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.  In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.  In addition, the cost of  
  
    21 

complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. 
  Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
  The retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments generate substantial net sales, a large majority of which are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment established through contractual relationship with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs"). 
  Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burden associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. 
  If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals.  Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. 
  One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or -club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
  Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally.  Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations.  If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.   
  The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in February 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates occurring in February 2016 have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly.  If we cannot offset the increases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit, achieving decreases in our operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017.  In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 
  
    22 

Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations, and the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of that segment, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes opening new units and growing comparable stores sales in the countries in which we have existing operations.  Our ability to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms.  Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. 
  In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods.  Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets may also limit our ability to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units in such markets which may adversely impact our financial results.  If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment through opening new units, growing comparable store sales or selective acquisitions, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. 
  Our Walmart International segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital retail operations, physical retail operations or both.  For example, in fiscal 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. providing for Walmart China to be a preferred retailer on its online-to-offline platform and our Sam's Club business in China to be a flagship store on its marketplace.  Any strategic alliance may not generate the level of e-commerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance.  In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, such as our investment in JD.com, Inc., could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  Financial Risks 
  Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. 
  Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries.  Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period.  In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. 
  As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates.  Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. 
  We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.  When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. 
  
    23 

Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.  
  We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results.  Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. 
  Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks 
  Our operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. 
  In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico. 
  In fiscal 2017, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately   76%   of our consolidated net sales.  The Federal Government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs.  Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. and the imposition of a border tax, or a border adjustment tax, on imports into the U.S.  A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries.  Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. 
  During fiscal   2017  , our Walmart International operations generated approximately   24%   of our consolidated net sales.  Our operating segments also source goods and services from other countries.  Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.  These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. 
  The potential imposition by the U.S. of a border tax or border adjustment tax, new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact a country in which we have operations could result in actions by that country to impose new, or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into such country from the U.S. or elsewhere and could damage the reputations of U.S.-based companies, including us, with customers and others in that country.  This could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our operations in such country or countries. 
  Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union. 
  Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of business in Brazil.  These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 
  The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance.  Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.  Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.  The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. 
  In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act.  We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.  Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our  
  
    24 

associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations.  Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. 
  We are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated.  The U.S. Congress and the current federal administration have identified federal tax reform as a priority for 2017.  Federal tax reform plans under consideration may result in significant changes to the U.S. tax code.  Some of the changes contemplated by the U.S. Congress, like the border tax or border adjustment tax, could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate, the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes, and our overall tax liability, and could reduce our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity, even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which corporate taxable income is taxed.  In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation.  Our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. 
  We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. 
  We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
  We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation.  In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.   
  In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in nearly 10,000 "equal value" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom.  The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified.  The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.  At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings.  We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "   Item 3. Legal Proceedings   " and in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an    exhibit    to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.  
  The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de M xico, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company.  We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs.  Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. 
  Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India.  In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the SEC.  We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters.  As discussions regarding resolution are preliminary, we cannot currently predict the timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters.  A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters.  Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. 
  
    25 

We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters.  One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties.  The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings.  We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences.  Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations. 
  While we believe it is probable we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations we cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters.  Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future.

  We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our principal office and own and lease office facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally for operations and field and market management.  The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company.  We use independent contractors to construct our buildings.  All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales volume.  Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents. 
  For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under "   Item 1. Business   ."

ITEM 3. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:   We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled "Contingencies," which is one of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference in this item.  We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought.  We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. 
  ASDA Equal Value Claims:   Ms S Brierley   Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008   Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley   Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley   Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley   Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). 
  II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS:   The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in   The New York Times (  the "  Times  "  )   on April 21, 2012.  One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company.  The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock.  On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification.  On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition.  In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the   Times   story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants.  The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of FCPA compliance.  All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery.  On March 31, 2015, the Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court.  On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the consolidated derivative proceedings in Arkansas.  There was no appeal from that ruling.  On May 13, 2016, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court.  On June 10, 2016, plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidated derivative proceedings filed their notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.  On January 18, 2017, the Delaware Supreme Court remanded those proceedings to the Court of Chancery for further briefing and an additional ruling on due process issues raised by the plaintiffs, before the Delaware Supreme Court renders its ultimate decision on the appeal.  Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:   Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters.  The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement.  For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
  In November and December 2016, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico ("Ministry") notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora de Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("Arrendadora"), that it was proposing aggregated penalties approximating $430,000 in respect to four stores which the Ministry believed may have been constructed without first obtaining a required environmental impact license.  Arrendadora has challenged the penalties before an administrative court and the trials are in process.  The Ministry had previously proposed penalties of approximately $640,000 related to this matter in 2014, but Arrendadora was released by an administrative court from payment of such penalties on the basis that the Ministry had failed to comply with legal formalities in connection with their imposition. 
  In November 2016, the state environmental agency in Santa Catarina, Brazil imposed aggregate penalties of approximately $180,000 against WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda ("Walmart Brazil") related to the fuel station at its store in Posto Cambori .  Such amount includes penalties related to a fuel tank leak and for operation of the fuel station in non-compliance with its license from 2009-2013 and without a license commencing in 2013.  These matters had been self-reported by Walmart Brazil to the environmental agency following an internal licensure review.  Walmart Brazil has filed its defense with the agency against the imposition of these penalties as well as its remediation plans and has been monitoring the underground water for contamination.  Following the filing of that defense, in March 2017 the environmental agency reduced the aggregate penalties to approximately $90,000 which amount has been paid by Walmart Brazil. 
  During fiscal year 2015, a California Greenwashing Task Force informed the Company that it was investigating whether the Company had violated a California statute that prohibits the sale of plastic products labeled by the Company's suppliers as "biodegradable" or "compostable."  In January 2017, the Company entered into a settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay approximately $950,000.  The Company also agreed to abide by a permanent injunction requiring compliance with California's laws related to the sale of products labeled "biodegradable," "degradable," "compostable," or "decomposable." 
  On April 23, 2015, Wal-Mart Transportation LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, received a Finding and Notice of Violation from the Environmental Protection Agency alleging that Walmart Transportation violated the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus regulations by failing to install particulate matter filters on some diesel fueled vehicles.  The Company responded and is in settlement negotiations with the agency. 
  On April 6, 2015, representatives for the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that Walmart Brazil had failed to file required reports documenting the number of tires imported, sold and recycled.  The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000, which may be doubled and excludes additional amounts in respect of inflation and interest, and prohibited Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved.  In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed its defense with the agency against the imposition of this penalty. 
  In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compa ias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank.  The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria T cnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. 
  In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil.  Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.

ITEM 9A. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. 
  In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls.  These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. 
  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. 
  Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2017  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10(d) 

WAL-MART STORES, INC. 
  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015 
  (As amended and restated effective June 5, 2015,  
  and as amended further effective February 1, 2017) 

1.1        Purpose and Effective Date.   Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ( Walmart ) believes it is important to provide incentives to Walmart s Associates, and Non-Management Directors, through participation in the ownership of Walmart and otherwise. The Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 was originally established under the name Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 1998 ( 1998 Plan ). The 1998 Plan was amended, restated and renamed from time to time, and approved and re-approved by Walmart stockholders, as the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2005 ( 2005 Plan ) and the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2010 ( 2010 Plan ), as amended and restated in 2013 ( 2013 Restatement ), and most recently on June 5, 2015, as the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 ( Plan ). The Plan, as heretofore amended, was amended and restated as of February 23, 2016 and is hereby further amended and restated as set forth herein effective February 1, 2017. The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentives to certain Associates and Non-Management Directors to enhance their job performance, to motivate them to remain or become associated with Walmart and its Affiliates, and to increase the success of Walmart. The Plan is not limited to Associates who are executive officers of Walmart, but will be available to provide incentives to any Associate or  Non-Management Director that the Committee believes has made or may make a significant contribution to Walmart or an Affiliate of Walmart. 
  DEFINITIONS 
  2.1         Affiliate    means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, other entity or other business association that is now or hereafter controlled by Walmart; provided that if a Plan Award provides for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and if the applicable Notice of Plan Award does not contain a definition of  Affiliate  that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 409A, then for purposes of such Plan Award,  Affiliate  means the entity for which the Recipient performs services and with respect to which the legally binding right to deferred compensation arises, and all persons that would be considered a single employer with such entity under section 414(b) of the Code (employees of controlled group of corporations), or section 414(c) of the Code (employees of partnerships, etc. under common control); provided that the applicable standard of control for purposes of such determination shall be  at least 50 percent  and provided further that the entity is one with respect to which Shares will qualify as  service recipient stock  under Code Section 409A. 
  2.2         Associate    means any person employed by Walmart or any Affiliate. 
  2.3         Board    means the Board of Directors of Walmart. 
  2.4         Cause    means a Recipient s commission of any act deemed inimical to the best interest of Walmart or any Affiliate, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. 
  2.5         Code    means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

2.6         Committee    means the committee of the Board with responsibilities including executive compensation matters subject to Regulation S-K Item 402, or other committee designated by the Board as the  Committee  under the Plan. Where such committee of the Board has delegated duties, powers or authority hereunder, the term  Committee  shall refer to the delegate. 
  2.7         Continuous Status    means the absence of any interruption or termination of the employment relationship between an Associate and Walmart or an Affiliate or the absence of any termination of services as a Non-Management Director. Continuous Status shall not be considered interrupted in the case of (a) sick leave, (b) military leave, or (c) any other leave of absence approved by Walmart or an Affiliate; provided that leave does not exceed one year, unless re-employment upon the expiration of that leave is guaranteed by contract or law or unless provided otherwise by a policy of Walmart or an Affiliate. Notwithstanding the preceding definition, if a Plan Award provides for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and if the applicable Notice of Plan Award does not define a term that is a  separation from service  within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then for purposes of such Plan Award the Recipient s Continuous Status will terminate if it is reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed by the Recipient after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Recipient would perform after such date (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an Associate or Non-Management Director, or in any other capacity) over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services to the Walmart or an Affiliate if the Recipient has been providing services to the Walmart or an Affiliate less than 36 months).

The Subject Shares may be authorized, but unissued Shares, treasury Shares held by Walmart or an Affiliate, or Shares acquired on the open  
  
   6 

market, including shares acquired on the open market by forwarding cash to an independent broker who will purchase Shares on behalf, and in the name of the Recipient. Shares reserved for delivery pursuant to a Plan Award or any rights thereto that expire, are forfeited or otherwise are no longer exercisable may be the subject of a new Plan Award. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Shares already owned by a Recipient and used to pay all or a portion of the exercise price of Shares subject to an Option, and (b) any other Shares reacquired by Walmart after such Shares have been issued (or, in the case of Open Market Shares, have been delivered), other than Restricted Stock that is forfeited or reacquired by Walmart without lapse of the Restrictions, shall not become Subject Shares to the extent such Shares are withheld, tendered, or reacquired by Walmart, or are otherwise no longer exercisable. For avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the preceding sentence, (i) when Stock Appreciation Rights are settled in shares, the full number exercised shall cease to be Subject Shares, (ii) when Options are  net exercised,  the full number exercised shall cease to be Subject Shares, and (iii) shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations shall cease to be Subject Shares. 
  3.2        Limits on Shares.   No Recipient may be granted a Plan Award denominated in Shares with respect to a number of Shares in any one Fiscal Year which when added to the Shares subject to any other Plan Award denominated in Shares granted to such Recipient in the same Fiscal Year would exceed 2,000,000 Shares; provided, however, that if the Performance Period applicable to a Plan Award exceeds twelve months, the 2,000,000 Share limit shall apply to each 12-month period in the Performance Period. If a Plan Award denominated in Shares is cancelled, the cancelled Plan Award continues to count against the maximum number of Shares for which a Plan Award denominated in Shares may be granted to a Recipient in any Fiscal Year. The Share limit shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect adjustments to Shares required by Section 11.9. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Non-Management Director may be granted a Plan Award denominated in Shares with respect to a number of Shares in any one Fiscal Year which when added to the Shares subject to any other Plan Award denominated in Shares granted to such Non-Management Director in the same Fiscal Year would exceed a Share value of $500,000; provided, however, that if the Performance Period applicable to a Plan Award granted to a Non-Management Director exceeds twelve months, the $500,000 limit shall apply to each 12-month period in the Performance Period. For sake of clarity, the $500,000 annual limit on Shares subject to any Plan Award granted to a Non-Management Director applies to Options granted under Section 6.1, Stock granted under Section 7.1, Restricted Stock granted under Section 7.2, Restricted Stock Units granted under Section 8.1, Stock Appreciation Rights granted under Section 9.1, and Performance Units granted under Section 10.1, but shall not include any Shares granted in lieu of cash compensation earned by a Non-Management Director or any Shares received by a Non-Management Director in settlement a Plan Award pursuant to Sections 6.3, 7.4, 8.3, 9.5, and 10.6.  
  ADMINISTRATION 
  4.1        Administration.

  4.2        Duties and Powers.   The Committee shall have these duties and powers as to the Plan: 
  
   7 

(a) 
    to establish rules, procedures, and forms governing the Plan; 
              (b) 
    to interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan and any Plan Award; 
              (c) 
    to recommend amendments of the Plan to the Board; 
              (d) 
    to determine those individuals who will be Recipients and what Plan Awards will be made to them; 
              (e) 
    to set the terms and conditions of any Plan Award and to determine and certify whether, and the extent to which, any such terms and conditions have been satisfied; 
              (f) 
    to determine the Fair Market Value of the Shares for any purpose;  
              (g) 
    to amend the terms of any Plan Award without the consent of the Recipient or any other person or to waive any conditions or obligations of a Recipient under or with respect to any Plan Award; provided that no amendment that, in the judgment of the Committee would materially adversely affect the Recipient shall be made without the Recipient s consent; provided further that no amendment that changes the timing of taxation of the Plan Award shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the Recipient; 
              (h) 
    to make such adjustments or modifications to Plan Awards to Recipients who are working outside the United States as are advisable to fulfill the purposes of the Plan or to comply with applicable local law and to establish, amend and terminate sub-plans for individuals outside the United States with such provisions as are consistent with the Plan as may be suitable in other jurisdictions to the extent permitted under local law; 
              (i) 
    to correct any defect or supply any omission; and 
              (j) 
    take any other action it deems necessary or advisable. 
     Notwithstanding the authority of the Committee under this Section 4.2 and notwithstanding any other discretionary power granted to the Committee under the Plan, except in connection with any corporate transaction involving Walmart, the terms of outstanding Plan Awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or cancel outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other Plan Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights without the prior approval of Walmart stockholders. 
  4.3        Delegation.   Except for the administration of Qualified Performance Based Awards and matters under the Plan affected by Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules adopted thereunder, the Committee may delegate ministerial duties under the Plan (including but not limited to the duties described in Section 4.2(h)) to one or more administrators, who may be Associates of Walmart, and may delegate non-ministerial duties to an officer of Walmart; provided that the delegate of non-ministerial duties shall not be authorized to make Plan Awards to himself or herself.  
  The Committee has delegated its powers, duties, and authority under the Plan (including the power to delegate, but not including the power to recommend amendments under Section 4.2(c)) with respect to Associates who are not Section 16 Persons, and other than Covered Employees whose awards are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, to the Global     Compensation     Committee of the Board. 
  The Board may also delegate administration of the Plan or a particular feature of the Plan to another Committee of the Board.  
  
   8 

Any delegated authority, duty or power may be revoked at any time by the delegator as it deems appropriate. Any delegated authority, duty or power may be exercised by the delegator as well as the delegate; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict between the exercise of any authority, duty or power by the delegator and the exercise of any authority, duty or power by the delegate, the exercise by the delegator shall govern. 
  4.4        Determinations Binding.   All actions taken or determinations made by the Committee, in good faith, with respect to the Plan, a Plan Award or any Notice of Plan Award shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons interested in the Plan or any Plan Award. 
  PARTICIPATION 
  5.1        All Associates and Non-Management Directors who the Committee determines have the potential to contribute significantly to the success of Walmart or an Affiliate, are eligible to participate in the Plan, except that Non-Management Directors may not receive Incentive Stock Options. An Associate may be granted one or more Plan Awards, unless prohibited by applicable law and subject to the limitations under Code Section 422 with respect to Incentive Stock Options. For any Performance Period for which Plan Awards are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, the Committee shall designate the Associates eligible to be granted Plan Awards no later than the 90th day of the Fiscal Year (or in the case of a Performance Period other than a Fiscal Year, after not later than the date 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed). 
  STOCK OPTIONS 
  6.1        Term of Options.   Walmart may grant Options covering Subject Shares to Associates and Non-Management Directors. The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be no more than 10 years from the date of grant unless the Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Recipient who, at the time of the grant, owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Walmart or any Parent/Subsidiary Corporation, in which case the term may not exceed 5 years from the date of grant. 
  Each Option shall be a Nonqualified Option unless designated otherwise in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding the designation of an Option, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares subject to Incentive Stock Options that are exercisable for the first time by a Recipient during a calendar year exceeds $100,000 (whether due to the terms of the Plan Award, acceleration of exercisability, miscalculation or error), or if such Option for any other reason fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, the excess Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Options. 
  6.2        Option Exercise Price and Consideration.   The per Share exercise price of an Option shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion, except that the per Share exercise price for an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant except that, with respect to an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Associate who owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Walmart or any Parent/Subsidiary Corporation at the time of the grant, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. The type of consideration in which the exercise price of an Option is to be paid shall be determined by the 
  
   9 

Committee in its discretion, and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the time of grant. 
  6.3        Exercise of Options.   An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when the person entitled to exercise the Option gives notice of exercise to Walmart in accordance with the Option s terms and Walmart receives full payment for the Shares as to which the Option is exercised or other provision for such payment is made in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee from time to time. Except with respect to Incentive Stock Options, such rules and procedures may include procedures for a  net-share settlement  method of exercise, under which, subject to the method requirements in the rules and procedures, the Recipient provides an irrevocable notice of exercise of the Option and Walmart retains a number of Shares sufficient to cover the exercise price and the minimum required withholding, and delivers the net number of Shares to the Recipient. In addition, if determined by the Committee in its discretion, which may be applied differently among Recipients or Plan Awards, an Option will be deemed exercised by the Recipient (or in the event of the death of the Recipient then by the person authorized to exercise the Recipient s Option under Section 11.6) on the expiration date of the Option, or if the NYSE is not open on the expiration date, on the last day prior to the expiration date on which the NYSE is open, using a net share settlement method of exercise to the extent that as of such expiration date the Option is vested and exercisable and the per Share exercise price of the Option is below the Fair Market Value of a Share on such expiration date.  
  6.4        Termination of Employment.   If a Recipient s Continuous Status is terminated for any reason other than Cause, the Recipient may exercise Options that are not subject to Restrictions as of the termination date to the extent set out in the Recipient s Notice of Plan Award. Incentive Stock Options may be exercised only within 60 days (or other period of time determined by the Committee at the time of grant of the Option and not exceeding 3 months) after the date of the termination (but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award), and only to the extent that Recipient was entitled to exercise the Incentive Stock Option at the date of that termination. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to or does not exercise an Option at the date of that termination or within the time specified herein or in the Notice of Plan Award, the Option shall terminate. In addition, the Recipient s right to exercise Options will be tolled pending any period initiated by the Committee to determine the existence of Cause with respect to the Recipient regardless of whether the commencement of such period is prior to, coincident with, or subsequent to the termination of the Recipient s Continuous Status. If the Committee determines there is no Cause, then the tolling period will end and the Recipient s right to exercise Options will be reinstated; provided, however, in no event will the exercise date of an Option be later than the earlier of (a) 90 days following the termination of the Recipient s Continuous Status plus the tolling period, or (b) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, an Associate s Continuous Status is not terminated for purposes of the Associate s Options if immediately upon the termination of the Associate s employment relationship with Walmart or an Affiliate the Associate becomes a Non-Management Director. 
  6.5        Administrative Suspension from Employment.   During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative suspension from employment, the Recipient s right to exercise Options will be suspended. If upon the conclusion of the administrative suspension the Recipient returns to employment, then the Recipient s right to exercise Options will be reinstated  
  
   10 

subject to Restrictions set forth in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, in no event will the exercise date of an Option be later than the expiration date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. 
  6.6        Disability of Recipient.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.4, in the case of an Associate s Incentive Stock Option, if the Recipient s Continuous Status is terminated as a result of his or her total and permanent disability (as defined in Code Section 22(e)(3)), the Recipient may, but only within 12 months from the date of that termination (but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award), exercise an Incentive Stock Option to the extent otherwise entitled to exercise it at the date of that termination. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to exercise an Incentive Stock Option at the date of termination, or if Recipient does not exercise that Incentive Stock Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Incentive Stock Option shall terminate. 
  6.7        Non-transferability of Options  . An Option may not be sold, pledged, hedged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner except by testamentary devise or by the laws of descent or distribution or, in those circumstances expressly permitted by the Committee, to a Permitted Transferee. For this purpose, a  Permitted Transferee  means any member of the Immediate Family of the Recipient, any trust of which all of the primary beneficiaries are the Recipient or members of his or her Immediate Family or any partnership of which all of the partners or members are the Recipient or members of his or her Immediate Family. The  Immediate Family  of a Recipient means the Recipient s spouse, children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, siblings, grandparents, nieces and nephews, or the spouse of any of the foregoing individuals. 
  6.8        Withholding.   The Committee may withhold, or provide for the payment of, any amounts necessary to collect any withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to an Option in accordance with Section 11.10 except to the extent otherwise provided under Section 6.3.

  7.3        Dividends; Voting.   While any Restriction applies to any Recipient s Restricted Stock, (a) unless the Committee provides otherwise, the Recipient shall receive the dividends paid on the Restricted Stock and shall not be required to return those dividends to Walmart in the event of the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock, (b) the Recipient shall have the right to, subject to all Restrictions then existing as to the Recipient s Restricted Stock, receive the proceeds of the Restricted Stock in any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of Walmart, which proceeds shall automatically and without need for any other action become Restricted Stock and be delivered as provided in Section 7.4, and (c) the Recipient shall be entitled to vote the Restricted Stock during the Restriction period. 
  7.4        Delivery of Shares.   Subject to any deferral election under Section 7.8, a Share will be  
  
   11 

delivered to the Recipient upon, or as soon as practicable after, the lapse of the Restrictions on a Share of Restricted Stock. Shares awarded under Section 7.1 shall be delivered immediately upon issuance of any such Plan Award. During the period of Restriction applicable to Restricted Stock, the Recipient shall not have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Restricted Stock or any interest therein. As a result of the retention of rights in the Restricted Stock by Walmart, except as required by any law, neither any Shares of the Restricted Stock nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other creditors  rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void.  
  7.5        Forfeiture.   Unless expressly provided for in the Plan Award, any Restricted Stock held by the Recipient at the time the Recipient ceases to be an Associate or Non-Management Director for any reason shall be forfeited by the Recipient to Walmart and automatically re-conveyed to Walmart. 
  7.6        Withholding.   The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to a Plan Award or the exercise or settlement thereof. 
  7.7        Evidence of Share Ownership.   The Restricted Stock will be book-entry Shares held for the benefit of the Recipient with stop transfer instructions on Walmart s stop transfer records until the Restrictions lapse, at which time Walmart will remove stop transfer instructions from the Shares on its stock transfer records.  
  7.8        Deferral of Shares or Restricted Stock.   At the time of grant of Shares or Restricted Stock (or at such earlier or later time as the Committee determines to be appropriate in light of the provisions of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit a Recipient of a Plan Award of Shares or a Plan Award of Restricted Stock to defer his or her Stock or Restricted Stock in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Alternatively, the Committee may, in its discretion and at the times provided above, permit an individual who would have been a Recipient of a Plan Award of Shares or a Plan Award of Restricted Stock to elect instead to receive an equivalent Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units to be settled in Shares and may permit the Recipient to elect to defer receipt of Shares under such Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units in accordance with Section 8.7. 
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS 
  8.1        Grant of Restricted Stock Units.   Walmart may grant Restricted Stock Units to those Associates and  Non-Management Directors as the Committee may select in its sole discretion. Each Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units shall have those terms and conditions that are expressly set forth in, or are required by, the Plan and the Notice of Plan Award, as the Committee may determine in its discretion. The Restrictions imposed shall take into account potential tax treatment under Code Section 409A.  
  8.2        Beneficial Ownership.   Until the Restricted Stock Unit is released from Restrictions and settled in Shares or cash, the Recipient shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares  
  
   12 

subject to the Restricted Stock Unit, nor shall the Recipient have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any Restricted Stock Unit or any interest therein. Except as required by any law, no Restricted Stock Unit nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other creditors  rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void. 
  8.3        Settlement of Restricted Stock Units.   Upon the lapse of the Restrictions, the Recipient of Restricted Stock Units shall, except as noted below, be entitled to receive, as soon as administratively practical, (a) that number of Shares subject to the Plan Award that are no longer subject to Restrictions, (b) in cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of Shares subject to the Plan Award that are no longer subject to Restrictions, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion and specify at the time the Plan Award is granted. Where in the judgment of the Committee, it is in the interests of Walmart to do so, a grant of Restricted Stock Units may provide that Walmart or an Affiliate may purchase Shares on the open market on behalf of a Recipient in accordance with Section 11.1 ( Open Market Shares ). 
  8.4        Forfeiture.   Restricted Stock Units and the entitlement to Shares, cash, or any combination thereunder will be forfeited and all rights of an Associate or Non-Management Director to such Restricted Stock Units and the Shares thereunder will terminate if the applicable Restrictions are not satisfied. 
  8.5        Limitation of Rights.   A Recipient of Restricted Stock Units is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g. voting rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of such Shares pursuant to the Plan. The Committee may, however, provide in the Notice of Plan Award that the Recipient shall be entitled to receive dividend equivalent payments on Restricted Stock Units, on such terms and conditions as the Notice of Plan Award shall specify. 
  8.6        Withholding.   The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to Restricted Stock Units. 
  8.7        Deferral of Restricted Stock Units  .     At the time of grant of Restricted Stock Units (or at such earlier or later time as the Committee determines to be appropriate in light of the provisions of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit the Recipient to elect to defer receipt of the Shares or cash to be delivered upon lapse of the Restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures shall take into account potential tax treatment under Code Section 409A, and may provide for payment in Shares or cash. 
  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS 
  9.1        Grant.   Walmart may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to those Associates and Non-Management Directors as the Committee selects in its sole discretion, on any terms and conditions the Committee deems desirable. A Recipient granted a Stock Appreciation Right will be entitled to receive payment as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award in an amount equal to (a) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date on which the Recipient properly  
  
   13 

exercises Stock Appreciation Rights that are no longer subject to Restrictions over the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of the Recipient s Stock Appreciation Rights, (b) a predetermined amount that is less than that excess, or (c) with respect to Recipients who are exempt from U.S. taxation and who are expected to remain exempt from U.S. taxation until the Plan Award is settled, any other amount as may be set by the Committee, multiplied by the number of Stock Appreciation Rights as to which the Recipient exercises the Stock Appreciation Right. The Committee may provide that payment with respect to an exercised Stock Appreciation Right may occur on a date which is different than the exercise date, and may provide for additional payment in recognition of the time value of money and any delay between the exercise date and the payment date.  
  9.2        Award Vesting and Forfeiture.   The Committee shall establish the Restrictions, if any, applicable to Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock Appreciation Rights and the entitlement to Shares thereunder will be forfeited and all rights of the Recipient to such Stock Appreciation Rights and the Shares thereunder will terminate if any applicable Restrictions in the Plan or Notice of Plan Award are not satisfied. 
  9.3        Beneficial Ownership.   The Recipient of any Stock Appreciation Rights shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares subject to such Plan Awards until Shares are delivered in satisfaction of the Plan Award nor shall the Recipient have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any Stock Appreciation Rights or any interest therein. Except as required by any law, neither the Stock Appreciation Rights nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other creditors  rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void. 
  9.4        Election to Receive Payments.   A Recipient of a Stock Appreciation Right may elect to receive a payment to which the Recipient is entitled under the Plan Award by giving notice of such election to the Committee in accordance with the rules established by the Committee. In addition, if determined by the Committee in its discretion, which may be applied differently among Recipients or Plan Awards, a Stock Appreciation Right will be deemed exercised by the Recipient (or in the event of the death of the Recipient then by the person authorized to exercise the Recipient s Stock Appreciation Right under Section 11.6) on the expiration date of the Stock Appreciation Right, or if the NYSE is not open on the expiration date, on the last day prior to the expiration date on which the NYSE is open, to the extent that as of such expiration date the Stock Appreciation Right is vested and exercisable and to the extent that, if the Recipient exercised such Stock Appreciation Right, the Recipient would receive a payment under Section 9.5. 
  9.5        Payments to Recipients.   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notice of Plan Award granting the Stock Appreciation Rights, a payment to a Recipient with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights may be made (a) in cash, (b) in Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date on which the Stock Appreciation Rights are settled equal to the amount of the payment to be made under the Plan Award, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion and specify at the time the Plan Award is granted. The Committee shall not make any payment in Shares if such payment would result in  
  
   14 

any adverse tax or other legal effect as to this Plan or Walmart.  
  9.6        Termination of Continuous Status.   If a Recipient s Continuous Status is terminated for any reason other than Cause, then, Recipient may elect payment with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights that are not subject to Restrictions as of the termination date to the extent set out in the Recipient s Notice of Plan Award. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to or does not elect payment with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right at the date of termination or within the time specified herein or in the Notice of Plan Award, the Stock Appreciation Right shall terminate. In addition, the Recipient s right to exercise Stock Appreciation Rights will be tolled pending any period initiated by the Committee to determine the existence of Cause with respect to the Recipient regardless of whether the commencement of such period is prior to, coincident with, or subsequent to the termination of the Recipient s Continuous Status. If the Committee determines there is no Cause, then the tolling period will end and the Recipient s right to elect payment of Stock Appreciation Rights will be reinstated; provided, however, in no event will the exercise date of a Stock Appreciation Right be later than the earlier of (a) 90 days following the termination of the Recipient s Continuous Status plus the tolling period, or (b) the expiration date of the Stock Appreciation Right as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, an Associate s Continuous Status is not terminated for purposes of the Associate s Stock Appreciation Rights if immediately upon the termination of the Associate s employment relationship with Walmart or an Affiliate the Associate becomes a Non-Management Director. 
  9.7        Administrative Suspension from Employment.   During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative suspension from employment, the Recipient s right to elect payment of Stock Appreciation Rights will be suspended. If upon the conclusion of the administrative suspension the Recipient returns to employment, then the Recipient s right to elect payment of Stock Appreciation Rights will be reinstated subject to Restrictions set forth in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, in no event will the date of the payment election be later than the expiration date of the term of the Stock Appreciation Right as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. 
  9.8        Limitation of Rights.   A Recipient of Stock Appreciation Rights is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g., voting rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of such Shares pursuant to the Plan. 
  9.9        Withholding.   The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to the Stock Appreciation Rights.  
  9.10        Deferral of Stock Appreciation Rights.   At the time of grant of a Plan Award of Stock Appreciation Rights the Committee may permit a Recipient who is exempt from U.S. taxation and who is expected to remain exempt from U.S. taxation until the Plan Award is settled to elect to defer the Shares or cash to be delivered in settlement of a Stock Appreciation Right in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee.  
  PERFORMANCE UNITS 
  10.1        Grant.   Walmart may grant Performance Units to those Associates and Non-Management Directors as it may select in its sole discretion, on any terms and conditions the Committee deems desirable. Each Plan Award of Performance Units shall have those terms and conditions  
  
   15 

that are expressly set forth in, or are required by, the Plan and Notice of Plan Award.  
  10.2        Performance Goals.   The Committee shall set Performance Goals which, depending on the extent to which they are met during a Performance Period, will determine the number of Performance Units that will be earned by the Recipient at the end of the Performance Period. The Performance Goals shall be set at threshold, target and maximum performance levels, with the number of Performance Units to be earned tied to the degree of attainment of the various performance levels under the various Performance Goals during the Performance Period. No Performance Units will be earned if the threshold performance level is not attained.  
  10.3        Beneficial Ownership.   The Recipient of Performance Units shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares subject to the Performance Units unless and until Shares are delivered in satisfaction of the Performance Units nor shall the Recipient have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hedge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any Performance Units or any interest therein. Except as required by any law, neither the Performance Units nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other creditors  rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void. 
  10.4        Determination of Achievement of Performance Goals.   The Committee shall, promptly after the date on which the necessary financial, individual or other information for a particular Performance Period becomes available, determine and certify the degree to which each of the Performance Goals have been attained.  
  10.5        Settlement of Performance Units.   After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the Recipient of Performance Units shall be entitled to payment based on the performance level attained with respect to the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Units. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce, eliminate or increase any amount of Shares or cash earned under Performance Units for any individual or group, except that such amount of Shares or cash intended to be a Qualified Performance Based Award may not be increased above the amount provided in the Notice of Plan Award. Unless deferred in accordance with Section 10.9, Performance Units shall be settled as soon as practicable after the Committee determines and certifies the degree of attainment of Performance Goals for the Performance Period. 
  The Committee shall have the discretion and authority to make adjustments to any Performance Units in circumstances where, during the Performance Period: (a) a Recipient leaves Walmart or an Affiliate and is subsequently rehired; (b) a Recipient transfers between positions with different incentive percentages or Performance Goals; (c) a Recipient transfers to a position not eligible to participate in the Plan; (d) a Recipient becomes eligible, or ceases to be eligible, for an incentive from another incentive plan maintained by Walmart or an Affiliate; (e) a Recipient is on a leave of absence; and (f) similar circumstances deemed appropriate by the Committee, consistent with the purpose and terms of the Plan; provided however, that the Committee shall not be authorized to increase the amount of Performance Units payable to a Covered Employee that would otherwise be payable if the amount was intended to be Qualified Performance Based Award.  
  10.6        Payments to Recipients.   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notice of Plan  
  
   16 

Award, payment to a Recipient with respect to Performance Units may be made (a) in Shares, (b) in cash or by check equal to the Shares  Fair Market Value on the date the Performance Units are settled, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the Committee shall determine at any time in its sole discretion.  
  10.7        Limitation of Rights.   A Recipient of Performance Units is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g. voting rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of Shares pursuant to the settlement of the Plan Award (if the Plan Award is settled in Shares). No dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to Performance Units. 
  10.8        Withholding.   The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to Performance Units. 
  10.9        Deferral of Shares or Cash Payout.   At the time of grant of Performance Units (or at such earlier or later time as the Committee determines to be appropriate in light of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit the Recipient to elect to defer delivery of Shares (or payment of cash) with respect to the Plan Award in accordance with such rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures shall take into account potential tax treatment under Code Section 409A. 
  MISCELLANEOUS 
  11.1        Issuance of Stock Certificates; Book-Entry; or Purchase of Shares.  
           (a) 
    If a Recipient has the right to the delivery of any Shares pursuant to any Plan Award, Walmart shall issue or cause to be issued a stock certificate or a book-entry crediting Shares to the Recipient s account promptly upon the exercise of the Plan Award or the right arising under the Plan Award. 
              (b) 
    A Recipient s right to Open Market Shares pursuant to settlement of a Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units or Performance Units shall not be satisfied by Walmart s delivery of Shares but rather Walmart or an Affiliate shall purchase the Shares on the open market on behalf of the Recipient by forwarding cash to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on behalf of the Recipient. 
     11.2        Compliance with Code Section 162(m). 
           (a) 
    To the extent awards to Covered Employees are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, the material terms of the Performance Goals under which awards are paid (and any material changes in material terms) shall be disclosed to and approved by Walmart s stockholders in a separate vote. Material terms include the eligible Recipients specified in Section 5.1, the Performance Measures pursuant to which the Performance Goals are set, and the maximum amount of compensation that could be paid to any Covered Employee or the formula used to calculate the amount of compensation to be paid to the Covered Employee if the Performance Goal is attained. 
              (b) 
    Performance Measures must be disclosed to and reapproved by the stockholders no later than the first stockholder meeting that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which stockholders previously approved the Performance Measures. If applicable laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without conditioning deductibility on obtaining stockholder approval (or reapproval) of any  
     
   17 

changes, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make changes without obtaining stockholder approval or reapproval.  
           (c) 
    Whenever the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant or pay awards that do not qualify as Qualified Performance Based Awards, the Committee may make grants or payments without satisfying the requirements of Code Section 162(m). 
              (d) 
    The Committee may, but shall not be required to, establish rules and procedures providing for the automatic deferral of Shares or other Plan payouts of Recipients who are Covered Employees as necessary to avoid a loss of deduction under Code Section 162(m)(1).  
     11.3        Termination of Employment or Interruption or Termination of Continuous Status.   Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Plan, the Committee shall determine the effect of the termination of an Associate s employment, or a Recipient s disability or death, or any other interruption or termination of Continuous Status, on the lapse of any Restrictions contained in a Plan Award made to the Recipient. During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative suspension, a Recipient s right to exercise or receive payment for any rights under any Plan Award or the vesting of any rights under any Plan Award shall be suspended to the extent permitted under local law. 
  11.4        Forfeiture for Cause.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, any Recipient upon a finding of  Cause  by the Committee shall forfeit all Plan Awards (and rights thereunder) granted under the Plan, whether or not vested or otherwise exercisable. 
  11.5        Repayment Obligation.  
           (a) 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, in the event the Committee or its delegate (which expressly may include any officer of Walmart or a non-Associate third party (such as counsel to Walmart)) determines that a Recipient has engaged in Gross Misconduct, then the Recipient shall forfeit all Plan Awards then outstanding, and the Recipient shall repay to Walmart any payments received from Walmart with respect to any Plan Awards subsequent to the date which is twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of the behavior serving as the basis for the finding of Gross Misconduct. Any amount to be repaid by a Recipient pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be held by the Recipient in constructive trust for the benefit of Walmart and shall be paid by the Recipient to Walmart with interest at the prime rate (as published in   The Wall Street Journal  ) as of the date the Committee or its delegate determines the Recipient engaged in Gross Misconduct. The amount to be repaid pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be determined on a gross basis, without reduction for any taxes incurred, as of the date of payment to the Recipient, and without regard to any subsequent change in the Fair Market Value of a Share.  
              (b) 
    If the Committee determines at any time that the Recipient of a Plan Award, prior to or within one year after the date of settlement of such Plan Award, (A) engaged in any act the Committee deems inimical to the best interest of Walmart or an Affiliate, (B) breached any restrictive covenant or confidentiality requirement to which the Recipient was subject; or (C) otherwise failed to comply with applicable policies of Walmart or an Affiliate at all times prior to the settlement of the Plan Award, the Recipient shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the amount paid or distributed in settlement of such Plan Award to Walmart. In addition, all Plan Awards, whether or not previously settled,  
     
   18 

and whether or not previously deferred, shall be subject to Walmart s policies, including Walmart s Statement of Ethics or requirements of applicable law (including regulations and other applicable guidance) regarding clawbacks (recoupment) as in effect from time to time. 
  11.6        Death of Recipient.   To the extent permitted in the Notice of Plan Award or under Committee rules and procedures, a Recipient may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the Recipient s Plan Award may be paid, or who is authorized to exercise the Recipient s Plan Award, in the event of the death of the Recipient, subject to Committee rules and procedures. If no such beneficiary is effectively named by the Recipient for any reason, then except to the extent otherwise provided in the Notice of Plan Award or Committee rules and procedures, if the Recipient dies, the Recipient s Plan Award may be paid to the Recipient s estate or may be exercised, in accordance with its terms or as allowed by law, by the Recipient s estate or by the beneficiary or person to whom the award devolves by bequest or inheritance. Unless otherwise provided in the Notice of Plan Award, (a) Plan Awards may be exercised after death only to the extent the Recipient was otherwise entitled to exercise the Plan Award at the date of the Recipient s death and only if exercised within 12 months after the Recipient s death, and (b) to the extent a Plan Award was unvested at the date of death, the Plan Award shall terminate. 
  11.7        Limitations on Liability and Award Obligations.    Receiving a Plan Award or being the owner of any Option, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, Stock Appreciation Right, or Performance Unit shall not:  
           (a) 
    give a Recipient any rights except as expressly set forth in the Plan or in the Plan Award and except as a stockholder of Walmart as set forth herein as to the Restricted Stock only;  
              (b) 
    as to Shares deliverable on the exercise of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or in settlement of Performance Units or Restricted Stock Units, until the delivery (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of Walmart of a duly authorized transfer agent of Walmart) of such Shares, give the Recipient the right to vote, or receive dividends on, or exercise any other rights as a stockholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the exercise (in the case of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) of the related Plan Award; 
              (c) 
    be considered a contract of employment or give the Recipient any right to continued employment, or to hold any position, with Walmart or any Affiliate;  
              (d) 
    create any fiduciary or other obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate to take any action or provide to the Recipient any assistance or dedicate or permit the use of any assets of Walmart or any Affiliate that would permit the Recipient to be able to attain any performance criteria stated in the Recipient s Plan Award;  
              (e) 
    create any trust, fiduciary or other duty or obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate to engage in any particular business, continue to engage in any particular business, engage in any particular business practices or sell any particular product or products;  
              (f) 
    create any obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate that shall be greater than the obligations of Walmart or that Affiliate to any general unsecured creditor of Walmart or the Affiliate; or 
              (g) 
    give a Recipient any right to receive any additional Plan Award of any type. 
     
   19 

If Walmart or an Affiliate terminates a Recipient s employment with Walmart or the Affiliate, the potential value of any Plan Award that must be returned to Walmart will not be an element of any damages that the Recipient may have for any termination of employment or other relationship in violation of any contractual or other rights the Recipient may have. 
  11.8        No Liability of Committee Members.   Walmart shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each other officer and director of Walmart or any Affiliate that has any duty or power relating to the administration of the Plan against any liability, obligation, cost or expense incurred by that person arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan or any Plan Award if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of Walmart. Indemnification of Associates, directors, and agents shall be determined pursuant to the requirements of Article VI of Walmart s Amended and Restated Bylaws.  
  11.9        Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.   Subject to any required action by the Walmart stockholders, the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) covered by each Plan Award, and the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) which have been authorized for delivery under the Plan but as to which no Plan Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of a Plan Award, the price per Share covered by any outstanding Plan Award that includes in its terms a price per Share, and the number of Shares with respect to which Plan Awards may be granted to an individual shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect an extraordinary dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares or other securities or property), stock split, reverse stock split, merger, reorganization, subdivision, consolidation or reduction of capital, recapitalization, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or reclassification of the Shares, or any other increase or decrease in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration by Walmart, issuance or warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of Walmart or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. That adjustment shall be made by the Committee, whose determination shall be final, binding and conclusive as to every person interested under the Plan. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by Walmart of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to a Plan Award. 
  11.10        Tax Withholding.   Whenever taxes are to be withheld in connection with the grant, vesting, lapse of restrictions, exercise or settlement of a Plan Award or for any other reason in connection with a Plan Award (the date on which such withholding obligation arises being hereinafter referred to as the  Tax Date ), the Committee may decide, in its sole discretion, to provide for the payment for the withholding of federal, state and local taxes (including Social Security and Medicare ( FICA ) taxes by one or a combination of the following methods and may (but need not) permit the Recipient to elect the method or methods: (a) payment in cash of the amount to be withheld, (b) requesting Walmart to withhold from Shares that would otherwise be delivered in settlement of a Plan Award payable in Shares (or upon the lapse of Restrictions on a Plan Award) a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the Tax Date or the last NYSE trading day prior to the Tax Date no greater than the amount to be withheld, (c) transfer of  
  
   20 

unencumbered Shares owned by the Recipient in circumstances permitted by the Committee valued at their Fair Market Value on the Tax Date or the last NYSE trading day prior to the Tax Date, (d) withholding from any cash compensation otherwise due to the Recipient; or (e) such other method as authorized by the Committee in its discretion. The Committee may set limits on the amount of withholding to be satisfied through withholding of Shares; e.g., the Committee may require that only the minimum withholding be satisfied in Shares, and may prohibit withholding from Open Market Shares or using a particular method if necessary or advisable in a particular country. Any fractional share amount must be paid in cash or withheld from compensation otherwise due to the Recipient.  
  11.11        Amendment and Termination of the Plan.   The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time without the approval of the Recipients or any other person, except to the extent any action of that type is required to be approved by the stockholders of Walmart under applicable law, listing standards, or in connection with any outstanding Qualified Performance Based Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment that, in the judgment of the Board would materially adversely affect a Recipient holding an Award shall be made without the Recipient s consent; provided that no amendment that changes the timing of taxation of a Plan Award shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the Recipient. 
  11.12        Compliance with Law.   The making of any Plan Award or delivery of any Shares is subject to compliance by Walmart with all applicable laws as determined by Walmart s legal counsel. Walmart need not issue or transfer any Plan Award or Shares pursuant to the Plan unless Walmart s legal counsel has approved all legal matters in connection with the delivery of any Plan Award or Shares.  
  11.13        No Representation or Warranty Regarding Tax Treatment.   Notwithstanding any language contained in the Plan or any Plan Award, Walmart does not represent or warrant that any particular tax treatment will be achieved.

Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the right to receive the number of Shares set forth above on the Vesting Date as further set forth in Paragraph 5 below, subject to certain vesting conditions. Before the Shares are vested and delivered to you, they are referred to in this Agreement as  Restricted Stock.    
  2.      Plan Governs  .  The Restricted Stock and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. You are accepting the Restricted Stock, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and acknowledging that the Restricted Stock and your participation in the Plan are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and of this Agreement.  You further agree to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations by the Committee of the Plan upon any disputes or questions arising under the Plan. 
  3.      Payment  . You are not required to pay for the Restricted Stock or the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock granted to you pursuant to this Agreement. 
  4.      Stockholder Rights  . Your Restricted Stock will be held for you by Walmart until the applicable delivery date described in Paragraph 5. You shall have all the rights of a stockholder of Shares of Restricted Stock that vest. With respect to your unvested Restricted Stock: 

A.  you shall have the right to vote the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock on any matter as to which Shares have voting rights at any meeting of shareholders of Walmart; 
  B.  you shall have the right to receive, free of vesting restrictions (but subject to applicable withholding taxes) all cash dividends paid with respect to such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock; and 
  C.  any non-cash dividends and other non-cash proceeds of such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock, including stock dividends and any other securities issued or distributed in respect of such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture conditions as are applicable to your Restricted Stock, and the term  Restricted Stock,  as used in this Agreement, shall also include any related stock dividends and other securities issued or distributed in respect of such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock. 
  5.      Vesting of Restricted Stock and Delivery of Shares  . 
           A. 
    Vesting  .  Your Restricted Stock will vest as follows, provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture Condition described below: 
                    Percentage of  
  Restricted Stock  Vesting 
    Vesting Date 

B.  Delivery of Shares  .  Upon the vesting of your Restricted Stock, subject to Paragraph 9 below, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares equal to the number of vested Restricted Stock, less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below. The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the Vesting Date. Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart. You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart. 
  6.  Forfeiture Conditions  .  Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on a Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:  
           A. 
    your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in Paragraph 8 below); or 
              B. 
    You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. 
     
   2 

Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a  Forfeiture Condition  for purposes of this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan Award is further conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a  Forfeiture Condition  for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares. 
  7.  Administrative Suspension  .  If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your Restricted Stock may be suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, your Restricted Stock may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your Restricted Stock will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any Restricted Stock that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the number of Shares corresponding to the vested Restricted Stock will be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7. 
  8.  Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability  .   
  A.  Your Restricted Stock that would have become vested on a Vesting Date not more than 90 days after the date your Continuous Status is so terminated by reason of your death or Disability will become vested earlier than described in Paragraph 5 above, and such earlier vesting date shall be considered a Vesting Date for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of your death or the date on which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of your Disability. 
  B.  If your Continuous Status is terminated due to your Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global Equity team. For purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments under the long-term disability plan or policy, as it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the  Employer ), regardless of whether you are covered by such policy. If Walmart or, if different, the Employer does not have a long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  means that you are unable to carry out the responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days. You shall not be considered to have incurred a Disability for purpose of this Paragraph 8 unless you furnish proof of such impairment sufficient to satisfy Walmart in its sole discretion. 
  
   3 

C.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Walmart will not accelerate your Plan Award if Walmart has not received notification of your termination within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to process the settlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. 
  9.  Deferral of Restricted Stock. 
  A.  Mandatory Deferral  .  If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of Restricted Stock in any year, when considered with your other compensation, would result in Walmart s inability to deduct the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section 162(m), then Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) (the  First Non-162(m) Year ) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A. However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver such Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and the Deferral Procedures. 
  B.  Elective Deferral of Restricted Stock  .  If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock award to a future date in accordance with Section 7.8 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election. 
  10.      Taxes and Tax Withholding  .   
  A.  You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Restricted Stock and acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.  Please see Paragraph 10.F regarding Section 83(b) elections. 
  B.   You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Employer, the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  C.  Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the Employer or their respective agents, at  
  
   4 

their sole discretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested Restricted Stock.  In the event that such withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the Restricted Stock and this Agreement, you authorize and direct: (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the vested Restricted Stock that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items; and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate. 
  D.  Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.   
  E.  Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
  F.  By accepting this Agreement, you agree not to make a Code Section 83(b) election with respect to this award of Restricted Stock. 
  11.      Restricted Stock Not Transferable  .  The Restricted Stock may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Restricted Stock and the issuance of the underlying Shares. Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect. 
  12.      Country-Specific Appendix  .  Notwithstanding any provision in these Restricted Stock Award Notification of Award and Terms and Conditions of Award to the contrary, the grant of Restricted Stock also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions as set forth in any appendix attached hereto (the  Appendix ) with respect to certain laws, rules, and regulations specific to your country. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Restricted Stock Award  
  
   5 

Notification of Award and Terms and Conditions of Award and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement. 
  13.      Nature of Plan Award  .  You further acknowledge, understand and agree that: 
  A.  the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;  
  B.  the grant of Restricted Stock is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock or other awards, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock, even if restricted stock has been granted in the past;

  D.  neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of Walmart or the Employer, if different, to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate; 
  E.  the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, relate exclusively to your Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your Restricted Stock; 
  F.  nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan; 
  G.  you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; 
  H.  the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 
  I.  the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments; 
  J.  unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and the value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you may provide as a director of any Affiliate; 
  K.  the future value of the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; 
  
   6 

L.  no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock resulting from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); 
  M.  in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement, your right to vest in the Restricted Stock under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law (  e.g.  , your period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of  garden leave  or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence); 
  N.  unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the Restricted Stock and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock, the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock; and 
  O.  if you are providing services outside the United States:  neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Restricted Stock or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Stock or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement. 
  14.      No Advice Regarding Award  .  Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares acquired upon vesting.  You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan. 
  15.  Data Privacy  .    You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart and any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.  You understand that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance identification number, passport or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all Restricted Stock or any other awards granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor ( Data ), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.  You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith and its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by  
  
   7 

Walmart in the future, which is assisting Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country.  You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative.  You authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of Data as may be required to Walmart s designated broker or other third party.  You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan.  You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you may, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative.  Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart would not be able to grant Restricted Stock or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards.  Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

  C.  The Committee will administer the Plan.  The Committee s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by the Committee selectively among recipients and eligible Associates, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. 
  D.  By accepting this Agreement, you agree to provide any information reasonably requested from time to time. 
  E.  This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. 
  
   8 

F.  The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 
  G.  If you receive this Agreement or any other documents related to your Plan Award or the Plan translated into a language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English language version of such document will control. 
  H.  Walmart may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party designated by Walmart. 
  I.  Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award, and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, to the extent Walmart determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 
  J.  You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any other Associate. 
  K.  You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your ability to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have  inside information  (as defined in the laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart s insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations, and any applicable Walmart insider trading policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter. 
  L.  You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter. 
  M.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver any Shares issuable upon vesting of the Restricted Stock prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of  
  
   9 

the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares.  Walmart may, without liability for its good faith actions, place legend restrictions upon Shares underlying your vested Restricted Stock and issue  stop transfer  instructions requiring compliance with applicable U.S. or other securities laws and the terms of the Agreement and Plan. Further, you agree that Walmart shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws, rules or regulations applicable to issuance of Shares.

  3.  Payment  .  You are not required to pay for the RSUs or the Shares underlying the RSUs granted to you pursuant to this Agreement. 
  4.  Stockholder Rights  .  Unless and until your RSUs vest and the underlying Shares have been delivered to you: 
  A.  You do not have the right to vote the Shares underlying your RSUs;  

B.  you shall have the right to receive, free of vesting conditions (but subject to applicable withholding taxes), dividend equivalent payments made in the form of cash (paid to you in your normal payroll), until the Vesting Date(s) shown below; and 
  C.  You will not have any other beneficial rights as a shareholder of Walmart due to the RSUs.  Upon receipt of the Shares, however, you will be accorded the same rights and responsibilities as any shareholder of Walmart, and will be provided with information regarding Walmart that is provided to all other shareholders of Walmart. 
  5.  Vesting of the RSUs and Delivery of Shares  .  Your RSUs will vest as follows, provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture Condition (as defined in Paragraph 6 below): 
                 Percentage of RSUs Vesting 
    Vesting Date 

Upon the vesting of your RSUs, subject to Paragraph 9 below, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs, less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below.  The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the Vesting Date.  Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart.  You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart. 
  Furthermore, Walmart or Wal-Mart Canada Corp. or an Affiliate ( WM Canada ), in their sole discretion, also may settle your vested RSUs in cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares. To the extent your Plan Award will be settled in Shares, you hereby acknowledge and agree that such settlement will be satisfied by WM Canada by forwarding a cash settlement amount in respect of the vested RSUs to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any Shares so purchased on the open market shall be delivered to you as set forth in this Paragraph 5. 
  6.  Forfeiture Conditions  .  Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the RSUs that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on the Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date: 
  A.  your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in Paragraph 8 below); or 
  B.  You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. 
  Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a  Forfeiture Condition  for purposes of this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan Award is further  
  
   2 

conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a  Forfeiture Condition  for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such RSUs (including any cash dividends related to the RSUs for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares. 
  7.  Administrative Suspension  .  If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your RSUs may be suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension.  If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, your RSUs may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to such RSUs or the underlying Shares.  If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your RSUs will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any RSUs that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs will be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7. 
  8.  Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability  .   
  A.  Your RSUs that would have become vested on a Vesting Date not more than 90 days after the date your Continuous Status is so terminated by reason of your death or Disability will become vested earlier than described in Paragraph 5 above, and such earlier vesting date shall be considered a Vesting Date for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of your death or the date on which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of your Disability. 
  B.  If your Continuous Status is terminated due to your Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global Equity team. For purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments under the long-term disability plan or policy, as it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the Employer, regardless of whether you are covered by such policy. If Walmart or, if different, the Employer does not have a long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  means that you are unable to carry out the responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days. You shall not be considered to have incurred a Disability for purpose of this Paragraph 8 unless you furnish proof of such impairment sufficient to satisfy Walmart in its sole discretion. 
  C.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Walmart will not accelerate your Plan Award if Walmart has not received notification of your termination within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to process the  
  
   3 

settlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. 
  9.  Deferral  .   
  A.  Mandatory Deferral.    If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs in any year, when considered with your other compensation, would result in Walmart s inability to deduct the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, then Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) of the Code (the  First Non-162(m) Year ) in accordance with the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.  However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver such Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code. 
  B.  Elective Deferral of Restricted Stock Units  .  If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your RSU award to a future date in accordance with Section 8.7 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election. 
  10.  Taxes and Tax Withholding  . 
  A.  You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your RSUs and acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice. 
  B.  You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the  Employer ), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ) is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer.  You further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the RSUs or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  
   4 

C.  Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested RSUs.  In the event that such withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the RSUs and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart, and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items.  However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate. 
  D.  Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. 
  E.  Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
  11.  RSUs Not Transferable  .  The RSUs may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the RSUs and the issuance of the underlying Shares.  Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect. 
  12.  Country-Specific Appendix  .  Notwithstanding any provision in these Global Share-Settled RSU Notification and Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the grant of RSUs also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any appendix attached hereto (the  Appendix ) with respect to certain laws, rules, and regulations specific to your country.  Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative  
  
   5 

reasons.  The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Global Share-Settled RSU Notification and Terms and Conditions and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement. 
  13.  Nature of Plan Award  .  You further acknowledge, understand and agree that: 
  A.  the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;  
  B.  the grant of RSUs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of RSUs or other awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs, even if RSUs have been granted in the past; 
  C.  all decisions with respect to future grants of RSUs or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Committee; 
  D.  neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of Walmart or, if different, the Employer to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate; 
  E.  the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, relate exclusively to your Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your RSUs; 
  F.  nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan; 
  G.  you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; 
  H.  the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 
  I.  the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments; 
  J.  unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and the value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you may provide as a director of any Affiliate; 
  K.  the future value of the Shares underlying the RSUs is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; 
  L.  no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSUs resulting from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason  
  
   6 

whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSUs, you agree not to institute any claim against Walmart, the Employer or any Affiliate; 
  M.  in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right to receive and vest in the RSUs under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law (  e.g.  , your period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of  garden leave  or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence); 
  N.  unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the RSUs and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the RSUs, the Shares underlying the RSUs, or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares underlying the RSUs; and 
  O.  if you are providing services outside of the United States:  neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement. 
  14.  No Advice Regarding Award  .  Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the RSUs acquired upon vesting.  You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan. 
  15.  Data Privacy  .    You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart and any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.  You understand that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance identification number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all RSUs or any other awards granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor ( Data ), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.  You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith and its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Walmart in the future, which is assisting  
  
   7 

Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.  You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country.  You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative.  You authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of Data as may be required to Walmart s designated broker or other third party.  You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan.

Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart would not be able to grant RSUs or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards.  Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

  B.  Walmart reserves the right to amend, abandon or terminate the Plan, including this Agreement, at any time subject to Committee approval.

  E.  This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without  regard to its conflict of law provisions.

You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party designated by Walmart. 
  I.  Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award, and the Shares underlying the RSUs, to the extent Walmart determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 
  J.  You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any other Associate. 
  K.  You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your ability to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have  inside information  (as defined in the laws in your country).  The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart s insider trading policy.  You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations and any applicable Walmart insider trader policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.

   9 

applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver any Shares issuable upon vesting of the RSUs prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable.

Further, you agree that Walmart shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to issuance of Shares.

Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive Shares (  e.g.  , RSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of your specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year.  Thus, RSUs likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other specified foreign property that you hold.  When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ( ACB ) of the Shares.  The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.

  GLOBAL SHARE-SETTLED PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT NOTIFICATION AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
    
  These Global Share-Settled Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions, including any applicable special terms and conditions for your specific country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (jointly, the  Agreement ), contain the terms and conditions of the performance-based restricted stock units ( PRSUs ) granted to you by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ( Walmart ), a Delaware corporation, under the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015, as may be amended from time to time (the  Plan ). 
    
  All the terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.  All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan. 
    
  BY SIGNING OR ELECTRONICALLY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE, UNDERSTAND, AGREE TO, AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING: 
    
  1.  Grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units  .  Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the PRSUs, which consist of the right to receive a number of Shares underlying the PRSUs set forth above (as further determined in Paragraph 5 below), subject to certain vesting conditions.   
  2.  Plan Governs  .  The PRSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.  You are accepting the PRSUs, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and acknowledging that the PRSUs and your participation in the Plan are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and of this Agreement.  You further agree to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations by the Committee upon any disputes or questions arising under the Plan, including whether, and the extent to which, the Performance Measures, Performance Goals, and time-based vesting restrictions referred to in Paragraph 5 have been satisfied. 

3.  Payment  .  You are not required to pay for the PRSUs or the Shares underlying the PRSUs granted to you pursuant to this Agreement. 
  4.  Stockholder Rights  .  Unless and until your PRSUs vest and the underlying Shares have been delivered to you: 
  A.  You do not have the right to vote the Shares underlying your PRSUs; 
  B.  You will not receive, nor be entitled to receive, cash or any non-cash dividends on the PRSUs or the Shares underlying the PRSUs; and 
  C.  You will not have any other beneficial rights as a shareholder of Walmart due to the PRSUs.  Upon receipt of the Shares, however, you will be accorded the same rights and responsibilities as any shareholder of Walmart, and will be provided with information regarding Walmart that is provided to all other shareholders of Walmart. 
  5.  Adjustment and Vesting of the PRSUs and Delivery of Shares  . 
  A.  Performance Period and Achievement Rates  .  The Committee establishes the Performance Goals and Performance Measures applicable to your PRSUs.  You will receive by separate writing a notification of the performance criteria applicable to your PRSUs in respect of the Performance Period which equals the fiscal year of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the  Employer ) during which the PRSUs have been granted.    The Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals as set forth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  
  The number of PRSUs that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that ultimately may be delivered to you shall depend upon the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordance with the Plan, for each Performance Measure during the Performance Period.  With respect to each applicable Performance Measure during the Performance Period: 
  1.   Threshold  performance means the achievement of the lowest possible Performance Goal established by the Committee; 
  2.   Target  performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and 
  3.   Maximum  performance means the highest possible achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee.  
  An achievement rate is determined for each Performance Measure applicable to your Plan Award in respect of the Performance Period.  The achievement rate value applied to each weighted Performance Measure during the Performance Period is expressed as a percentage and may range from 0% (for achieving less than Threshold Performance), 50% (for achieving at least, but no less than, Threshold performance), 100% (for achieving Target performance), or up to 150% (for achieving Maximum performance).  A percentage of 0% shall be applied to a Performance Measure during the Performance Period if Threshold performance is not achieved.  The weighted average of all applicable 
  
   2 

achievement rates during the Performance Period is referred to herein as the  Performance Achievement Rate.  
  At the end of the Performance Period, the number of PRSUs that were granted to you shall be adjusted to reflect the degree to which applicable Performance Goals have been attained by   multiplying  : (x) the Performance Achievement Rate   and   (y) the number of PRSUs granted by this Agreement. Subject to Paragraph 10 below, and provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture Condition before the Vesting Date, the adjusted number of PRSUs (the  Adjusted PRSUs ) represent the number of Shares you shall receive, as described in Paragraph 5.C below.  
  B.  Vesting of the Adjusted PRSUs  .  Subject to Paragraph 7 and provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture Condition, your Adjusted PRSUs will vest on the Vesting Date set forth above. 
  C.  Delivery of Shares  .  Upon the vesting of your Plan Award, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares equal to the number of Adjusted PRSUs as calculated in Paragraph 5.A. above less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below.  The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible following the later of: (x) the Vesting Date set forth above; and (y) the date the Committee has determined the degree of attainment of the Performance Goals applicable to your Plan Award, but in any event: 
            2. 
    within 74 days of an Accelerated Vesting pursuant to Paragraph 8 below. 
     Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart.  You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart. 
  D.  Deferral of Shares  .   
  1.  Elective Deferral.    If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares upon vesting of Adjusted PRSUs to a future date in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election. 
  2.  Mandatory Deferral  .  If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of Adjusted PRSUs in any year would, when considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart s inability to deduct the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, then Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) of the Code (the  First Non-162(m) Year ) in accordance with the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.  However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year (and to the extent Walmart has permitted such an election), then Walmart shall not deliver such  
  
   3 

Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code. 
  To the extent you are a  covered employee  within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, your Plan Award and this Agreement are subject to, and conditioned upon, shareholder approval of the material terms of the Performance Goals referred to in Paragraph 5.A above. 
  6.  Forfeiture Condition  .  Subject to Paragraph 8 below, any PRSUs that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on the Vesting Date, if any, will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date: 
  A.  your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in Paragraph 8 below); or 
  B.  you have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. 
  Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a  Forfeiture Condition  for purposes of this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that vesting of this Plan Award is further conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete prior to the Vesting Date shall also be deemed a  Forfeiture Condition  for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such PRSUs or the underlying Shares. 
  7.  Administrative Suspension  .  If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your PRSUs may be suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension.  If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, your PRSUs may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to such PRSUs or the underlying Shares.  If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your PRSUs will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any PRSUs that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the corresponding number of Shares will be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7. 
  8.  Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability  .  Your PRSUs will vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.B. above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a Vesting Date, if your Continuous Status is terminated by your death or Disability prior to the Vesting Date and you have not incurred a Forfeiture Condition. The number of Shares you will become vested in under this Paragraph 8 shall be determined as follows:  
  A.  Any PRSUs that are scheduled to vest within 90 days of the date that your Continuous Status is terminated by reason of your death or Disability will become  
  
   4 

immediately vested;   provided, however  , that if the determination of attainment of Performance Goals has not yet been determined for your Plan Award, then achievement of Target performance for all applicable Performance Goals shall be assumed for purposes of this Paragraph 8.A; and 
  B.  Any PRSUs that are scheduled to vest more than 90 days but within the same fiscal year as the date on which your Continuous Status was terminated by reason of your death or Disability shall vest and the number of Shares you shall receive will be prorated by dividing: (x) the number of calendar days from the Grant Date to the date your Continuous Status was terminated   by   (y) the number of calendar days from the Grant Date through the Vesting Date set forth above;   provided, however  , that if the determination of attainment of Performance Goals has not yet occurred for your Plan Award, then achievement of Target performance for all applicable Performance Goals shall be assumed for purposes of this Paragraph 8.B. 
  For purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of death or the date on which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments under the long-term disability plan or policy, as it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the Employer, regardless of whether you are covered by such policy.  If Walmart or, if different, the Employer does not have a long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  means that you are unable to carry out the responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days.  You shall not be considered to have incurred a Disability unless you furnish proof of such impairment sufficient to satisfy Walmart in its discretion. If your Continuous Status is terminated due to a Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global Equity team.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Walmart will not accelerate your Plan Award if Walmart has not received notification of your termination within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to process the settlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. 
  9.  Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates  .   
  A.  Permanent Transfers and Continuous Status  .  For the avoidance of doubt, a permanent transfer of Continuous Status from Walmart, or the Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute a termination of your Continuous Status.  
  B.  Applicable Performance Measures and Goals Upon Permanent Transfer  . If you permanently transfer your Continuous Status during the Performance Period, then the performance criteria and the resulting adjustment will be prorated and/or adjusted to reflect the proportion of the Performance Period during which you provided service to Walmart, or, if different, the Affiliate that initially employed you (the  Initial Employer ) and the proportion of the Performance Period during which you provided service to Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate to which you permanently transferred (the  Subsequent Employer ). 
  
   5 

C.  Permanent Transfers to Affiliate or Position where Performance-Based Awards are Not Granted  .  If you permanently transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are not granted, the performance criteria applicable for the remaining portion of your Performance Period shall be communicated to you, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described in Paragraph 9.B above. 
  D.  Transfers to New Position with Same Employer  .  If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as defined herein) but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals, then the performance criteria applicable for the remaining portion of your Performance Period shall be communicated to you, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described in Paragraph 9.B above.  
  10.  Taxes and Tax Withholding  .   
  A.  You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your PRSUs and acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice. 
  B.  You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart (or if different, the Employer), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ) is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer.  You further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the PRSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the PRSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the PRSUs or any aspect of the PRSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
  C.  Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, you authorize Walmart, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the Adjusted PRSUs.  In the event that such withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the PRSUs and this Agreement, you authorize and direct (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the Adjusted PRSUs that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion to satisfy the Tax-Related  
  
   6 

Items by any other method of withholding, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate. 
  D.  Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for the Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates.  Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Adjusted PRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.  In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any overwithheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. 
  E.  Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. 
  11.  PRSUs Not Transferable  .  The PRSUs may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Adjusted PRSUs and the issuance of the underlying Shares.  Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect. 
  12.  Country-Specific Appendix  .  Notwithstanding any provision in these Global Share-Settled Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the grant of PRSUs also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any appendix attached hereto (the  Appendix ) with respect to certain laws, rules and regulations specific to your country.  Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons.  The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Global Share-Settled Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement. 
  13.  Nature of Plan Award  .  You further acknowledge, understand and agree that: 
  A.  the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature; 
  B.  the grant of PRSUs is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of PRSUs or other awards, or benefits in lieu of PRSUs, even if PRSUs have been granted in the past;

  E.  the PRSUs and the Shares underlying the PRSUs, and the income and value of same, relate exclusively to your Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your PRSUs;

  J.  unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the PRSUs and the Shares underlying the PRSUs, and the income and the value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you may provide as a director of any Affiliate; 
  K.  the future value of the Shares underlying the PRSUs is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; 
  L.  no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the PRSUs resulting from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the PRSUs, you agree not to institute any claim against Walmart, the Employer or any Affiliate; 
  M.  in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are  employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right to receive and vest in the PRSUs under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law (  e.g.  , your period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of  garden leave  or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence); 
  
   8

  O.  if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the PRSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the PRSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement. 
  14.  No Advice Regarding Award  .  Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the PRSUs acquired upon vesting.

Foreign Asset/ Account Reporting Information  .  Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive Shares (  e.g.  , PRSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of your specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year.  Thus, PRSUs likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other specified foreign property that you hold.  When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ( ACB ) of the Shares.  The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.

Exhibit 10(v) 

DEFERRED CONTINGENT MERGER CONSIDERATION AGREEMENT

  Marc Lore 
  c/o Jet.com, Inc. 
  221 River Street 
  Hoboken, NJ 07030 
    
  Dear Marc Lore: 
    
  As you know, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Acquiror   ), has agreed to acquire by merger (the    Merger   ) Jet.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated of even date herewith (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the    Merger Agreement   ), by and among the Acquiror, the Company and certain other parties thereto.  Capitalized terms used in this agreement (this    Agreement   ) and not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.  Any reference to the    Acquiror    will be understood to include any successor to the Acquiror. 
    
  Upon the Closing, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will be entitled to receive, for each share of Common Stock held by you immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration.  Notwithstanding the terms of the Merger Agreement, you agree that the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to you pursuant to the Merger Agreement shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement. 
    
           1. 
    Merger Consideration Election 
       
  The parties hereby agree that 25% of the Merger Consideration payable to you at the Closing shall be paid to you in cash in accordance with the provisions of Article II of the Merger Agreement, and that 75% of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to you at the Closing (such Merger Consideration, the    Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration   ) shall be payable to you on the applicable annual or monthly anniversary of the Closing Date set forth in the Consideration Schedule (as defined below), contingent upon and subject to the following provisions. 
    
           2. 
    Deferral of Merger Consideration 
       
  All of your Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration will be deferred at the Closing and will be held back by the Acquiror and not paid to you.  You will permanently forfeit (except as otherwise provided for below) for no consideration, and the Acquiror will permanently retain, any portion of the Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration that has not become payable to you pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as of the date of termination of your Employment (as defined below), whether on a voluntary basis or for any other reason, except as provided in Section 3 below (this provision, the    Forfeiture Provision   ).     Employment    means your status as an employee of the Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Company) then employing you (your    Employer   ).  For the avoidance of doubt, your Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration may become payable in accordance with the Consideration Schedule during any period in which you are taking a leave of absence approved in writing by the Acquiror. 

The Forfeiture Provision will lapse as to each installment of Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration set forth on   Annex A   attached hereto (the    Consideration Schedule   ) on the corresponding date for such installment set forth on the Consideration Schedule, if your Employment has not been terminated as of such installment date, meaning that such installment of Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration will become payable to you on such corresponding installment date, without any interest.  Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration that has become payable pursuant to the Consideration Schedule is referred to as    Due Merger Consideration   . 
    
  You will receive the payment of your Due Merger Consideration (without interest) on the last day of the calendar month in which such Due Merger Consideration becomes payable in accordance with the Consideration Schedule, regardless of your Employment on such date;   provided   that if the last day of any such calendar month is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. 
    
           3. 
    Special Situations 
       
  Subject to any other requirements or limitations in this Agreement, in the event of a termination of your Employment due to an Involuntary Termination (as defined below) or on account of death or Disability, all of your then-Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration will be payable in accordance with the Consideration Schedule. 
    
     Involuntary Termination    means termination in writing by your Employer of your Employment without Cause (as defined below) and/or your resignation from your Employer for Good Reason (as defined below). 
    
     Cause    means your termination of employment by your Employer due to (a) your intentional or grossly negligent unauthorized misuse of any trade secrets or proprietary information of your Employer of an Affiliate thereof, (b) your conviction of or plea of nolo contendere to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, (c) your committing an act of fraud against your Employer or an Affiliate thereof, (d) your gross negligence or willful misconduct that has had, will have or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on your Employer s or any of its Affiliates  reputation or business, (e) your violation of the Acquiror s (i) Global Statement of Ethics or (ii) Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers, in each case in this clause (e) if such violation is not cured (to the extent curable) within 30 days following written notification by the Acquiror of such violation, (f) your willful and repeated failure or refusal to attempt to perform your duties to your Employer if such failure is not cured within 30 days following written notification by Employer of such failure, or (g) your material breach of that certain Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and No Hire Agreement dated August 7, 2016, that certain Nondisclosure and Restricted Use Agreement dated August 7, 2016 between you and the Acquiror or that certain Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement between you and Jet.com, Inc. dated April 16, 2014, if such breach is not cured (to the extent curable) within 30 days following written notification by Employer of such breach. 
    
     Disability    means a  permanent and total disability  as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;   provided   that you shall not be considered to have a Disability unless you furnish such proof (including written certification from a physician) of the existence thereof in such form and manner, and at such times, as the Acquiror may reasonably require. 

Good Reason    means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) a material reduction in your base salary or (b) a required relocation of your principal place of employment by more than 75 miles;   provided  , that you shall have grounds for a Good Reason resignation only if (i) you notify your Employer in writing within 60 days of the occurrence of the circumstances constituting Good Reason, (ii) your Employer does not reasonably cure such circumstances within 15 days following its receipt of such notice, and (iii) you actually resign within 30 days following the end of such cure period. 
    
           4. 
    Tax Matters 
       
    The parties hereto agree that it is their intention that the Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration attributable to Common Stock either (x) that is vested as of the Closing or (y) for which a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code was properly and timely made except as required by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, (i) will be treated as deferred contingent purchase price for which capital gains treatment is available with respect to your Common Stock and (ii) will be reported for federal income tax purposes, as deferred contingent purchase price for such Common Stock.  The parties shall take all tax reporting positions consistent with this paragraph, except if challenged in writing by a Governmental Authority, in which case the challenged party shall give notice of same to the other party and each party shall use best efforts to cooperate jointly to defend the positions taken in this paragraph until such time as a non-appealable order has concluded that a different tax consequence applies to the Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration. 
    
  You agree to submit a completed and executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 to the Acquiror at the Closing. 
    
           5. 
    Miscellaneous 
       
  The terms of Section 10.9 (Governing Law), Section 10.10 (Submission to Jurisdiction) and Section 10.15 (Waiver of Jury Trial) of the Merger Agreement are incorporated herein,   mutatis mutandis  . 
    
  The provisions of this Agreement are applicable only if the Merger is consummated, and this Agreement will become null and void should the Merger not be consummated for any reason. 
    
  Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, the conditions to the obligations of the Acquiror to consummate the Merger are solely for the benefit of the Acquiror and may be waived by the Acquiror in its sole discretion without notice, liability or obligation to you or any other person. 
    
  This Agreement may not be amended or otherwise modified without the prior written consent of the Acquiror and you, provided that the Acquiror may terminate the Forfeiture Provision by providing written notice to you without your consent. 
    
  By signing below, you also agree that the Acquiror may rely upon such delivery of this Agreement as conclusively evidencing the terms and conditions referred to in this Agreement for purposes of modifying (to the extent necessary) all agreements and instruments to which such terms and conditions are applicable or relevant. 

In no event shall any provision of this Agreement or transaction contemplated hereby, give or be deemed to give you any right to continued employment by the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company) or affect in any manner the right of your Employer to terminate your employment at any time. 
    
  You hereby acknowledge that (i) you have carefully read this Agreement, (ii) following the consummation of the Merger, this Agreement will be enforceable by the Acquiror and the Acquiror will be entitled to seek damages for any breach of this Agreement, (iii) the terms of this Agreement are irrevocable to the fullest extent provided under the laws of the State of Delaware, (iv) you have had adequate opportunity to consult with counsel prior to entering into this Agreement and (v) the material terms of this Agreement will be disclosed to the other stockholders of the Company in connection with the approval of the Merger and related payments to employees.

Without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, neither party hereunder shall have the right to assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer, in whole or in part, its rights or obligations under this Agreement. 
    
  This Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, including all the exhibits and schedules attached hereto or thereto constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to the Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration (including the terms of any stock purchase, stock restriction or similar agreement, equity grant or award, offer letter, employment agreement or other plan, agreement or arrangement, between the you and the Company). 
    
  This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which will constitute one instrument. 
    
  If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable to the extent of such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.

During the Term and thereafter, Holder shall not disparage Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates in any manner that could affect the goodwill, reputation or business relationships of any such Person with the public generally, or with any of their customers, suppliers, employees or other business partners. 
  4.        Confidentiality  .  During the Term, except as may be required by applicable law and except for Holder s attorneys and accountants, and other representatives who need to know the terms and conditions hereof to provide the services rendered to Holder, Holder shall not make any disclosure concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Acquiror, the Company, any of their respective Affiliates or the business, performance, structure or governance of any of the Acquiror, the Company, any of their respective Affiliates, without prior written approval by the Acquiror, which approval may be given or withheld by the

Acquiror in its sole discretion.  If any announcement is so required by applicable law with respect to any party hereto, prior to making such announcement, such party will deliver a draft of such announcement to the Acquiror and shall give the Acquiror reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. 
  5.        Stay of Time  .  In the event a court of competent jurisdiction or other entity or person mutually selected by the parties to resolve any dispute (collectively a    Court   ) has determined that Holder has violated one or more provisions of this Agreement, the running of the time period of such provisions so violated shall be automatically suspended as of the date of such violation and shall be extended for the period of time from the date such violation commenced through the date that the Court determines that such violation has permanently ceased. 
  6.        Specific Performance  .  Holder acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the Company and the Acquiror would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages.  It is accordingly agreed that, with respect to any such breach, the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action.  In the event of litigation arising out of this Agreement, if a Court issues a final non-appealable judgment, the non-prevailing party in such litigation agrees to reimburse the prevailing party for its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney s fees) in obtaining such judgment. 
  7.        Notices  .  All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (a) on the date of delivery if delivered personally, or if by  mail, upon written confirmation of receipt by e mail or otherwise, (b) on the first Business Day following the date of dispatch if delivered utilizing a next-day service by a recognized next-day courier or (c) on the earlier of confirmed receipt or the fifth Business Day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

  8.        Separate Covenants  .  This Agreement shall be deemed to consist of a series of separate covenants, one for each line of business included within the Business as it may be conducted by the Company and its successors on or after the date hereof, and each city, county, state, country or other region included within the Business Area.  The parties expressly agree that the character, duration and geographical scope of this Agreement are reasonable in light of the circumstances as they exist on the date upon which this Agreement has been executed.  However, should a determination nonetheless be made by a Court at a later date that the character, duration or geographical scope of this Agreement is unreasonable in light of the circumstances as they then exist, then it is the intention and the agreement of the Company, the Acquiror and Holder that this Agreement shall be construed in such a manner as to impose only those restrictions on the conduct of Holder that may be enforceable under applicable law, to the fullest extent of such enforceability to assure the Company and the Acquiror of the intended benefit of this Agreement.  If, in any judicial proceeding, a Court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants deemed included herein because, taken together, they are more extensive than necessary to assure the Company and the Acquiror of the intended benefit of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed among the parties hereto that those of such covenants that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced in such proceeding shall, for the purpose of such proceeding, be deemed eliminated from the provisions hereof. 
  9.        Severability  .  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a Court to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and this Agreement and all disputes hereunder shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflicts of law provision which would require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.  By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party or its successors or assigns against any other party shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such legal action or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein.  Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient.  Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (a) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (b) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (c) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 
  11.        Amendments and Waivers  . 
  (a)        This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the parties hereto at any time with respect to any of the terms contained herein. 
  (b)        Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 
  12.        Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; except for that certain Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement dated as of August 7, 2016, which is in full and force and effect, along with this Agreement.

13.        Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate counterparts (including facsimile and electronic transmission counterparts), each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all of which, when taken as a whole, shall constitute one and the same instrument. 
  14.        Section Headings and References  .  The headings of each Section, subsection or other subdivision of this Agreement are for reference only and shall not limit or control the meaning thereof.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 
  16.        Further Assurances  .  From time to time, at the request of any member of the Company and without further consideration, Holder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as reasonably requested, to make effective, in the most expeditious manner possible, the terms of this Agreement.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  Overview 
  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world.  Through our operations, we help people around the world save money and live better   anytime and anywhere   in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities.  Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping and saves time for our customers.  Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate.  Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.  Each week, we serve over   260 million   customers who visit our   11,695   stores under   59   banners in   28   countries and e-commerce websites in   11   countries.  Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.  By leading on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP").  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Price leadership is core to who we are.  Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.  Our digital and physical presence, which we are investing in to integrate, provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.  We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. 
  Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. 
             
    Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail.  Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate").  In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. 
                
    Walmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses.  These businesses consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash   carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail.  The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.  Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding digital retail. 
                
    Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail.  As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.  
     The following examples illustrate the pursuit of our strategy to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping:  
             
    In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"), a U.S. based e-commerce company.  The total purchase price for the acquisition was $2.4 billion, net of cash acquired.  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets.  As part of the transaction consideration, we will pay additional amounts accounted for as compensation of approximately $0.8 billion over a five year period, including approximately $0.5 billion in cash and approximately $0.3 billion in equity.  The impact on fiscal 2017 net sales and operating income as a result of the acquisition was not significant.  The acquisition of jet.com is in line with the Company's strategic framework of accelerating e-commerce growth. 
                
    In June 2016, we announced our strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. ("JD") and the sale to JD of certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application in exchange for approximately 5 percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis.  The sale resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain in our International segment, which gain is included in membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9 billion of additional JD shares classified as available for sale securities, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent, for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares. 
     Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently.  Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
  Our fiscal year ends on   January 31   for our U.S. and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis.  Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns.  Historically, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending   January 31  .

This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2017   ("fiscal   2017  "),   January 31, 2016   ("fiscal   2016  ") and   January 31, 2015   ("fiscal   2015  ") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.  We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. 
  Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.  When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. 
  Comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year.  Walmart's definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as e-commerce sales.  We measure the e-commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through websites and mobile commerce applications and fulfilled through our e-commerce distribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online and on our mobile commerce applications, but fulfilled through our stores and clubs.  Sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent.  Additionally, sales related to e-commerce acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.  Comparable store and club sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
  In discussing our operating results, we use the term "currency exchange rates" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.  We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates.  Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. 
  The Retail Industry 
  We operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve.  We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses.  Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence.  We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees (whom we call "associates").  We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.  Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2017  , and in the discussion under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information" in our Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for the fiscal year ended   January 31, 2017  .

Company Performance Metrics 
  We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  For several years, our performance metrics emphasized three financial priorities: growth, expense leverage and returns.  We are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the integration of digital and physical retail.  These investments support long-term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported by everyday low cost.  During this time of increased investments, we are focused primarily on growth, balanced by the long-term health of the Company including expense leverage and returns.  Although we will continue to grow through new stores and clubs, our growth going forward will rely more on increasing comparable store and club sales and accelerating e-commerce sales growth. 
  Our objective of balancing growth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managing working capital to deliver strong free cash flow.  We plan to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
   
  Growth 
  We measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period-over-period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales, which include the impact of e-commerce sales.  At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.  These strategic investments may not benefit net sales and comparable store and club sales in the near term. 
  Net Sales 

Our consolidated net sales increased   $2.7 billion   or   0.6%   for fiscal   2017   and decreased $3.6 billion or   0.7%   for fiscal   2016  , when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Net sales for fiscal   2017   were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales and e-commerce sales and the   1.3%   year-over-year growth in consolidated retail square feet.  The positive effect of such factors was partially offset by a negative impact of   $11.0 billion   or   2.3%   as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a   $0.4 billion   decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment.  Net sales for fiscal   2016   were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment.  The negative effect of such factors was partially offset by 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. 
  Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales 
  Comparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year.  The retail industry generally reports comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.  As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases.  Calendar comparable store and club sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , were as follows:

Table of Contents  

Comparable store and club sales in the U.S., including fuel,     increased   1.4%     and     0.3%     in fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The fiscal   2017   total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment.  E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately   0.4%   and   0.7%   for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal   2017  .  The fiscal   2016   total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, offset to a significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment.  E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.2% and 0.6% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal   2016  . 
  As we continue to add new stores and clubs in the U.S., we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units.  We estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.7% and 0.8% in fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  Our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened.

Returns 
  While we are focused primarily on growth, we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced.  We generate returns by efficiently deploying assets and effectively managing working capital.  We monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics, which we discuss below.  In addition, we are focused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. 
  We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. 
  Return on Assets and Return on Investment  
  Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.  We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. 
  ROA was   7.2%   and   7.5%   for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  ROI was   15.2%   and   15.5%   for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The declines in ROA and ROI were primarily due to our decrease in operating income over these periods. 
  We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight.  When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations. 
  Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI.  In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.  As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital.  Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. 
  Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Free Cash Flow 
  Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.      Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  See    Liquidity and Capital Resources    for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. 
  We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  We had net cash provided by operating activities of   $31.5 billion  ,   $27.4 billion   and   $28.6 billion   for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We generated free cash flow of   $20.9 billion  ,   $15.9 billion   and   $16.4 billion   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal   2017   from fiscal   2016   was primarily due to improved working capital management.  Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal   2016   from fiscal   2015   was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations, partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capital management. 
  Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. 
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. 

(1)  "Net cash used in investing activities" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.

Results of Operations 
  Consolidated Results of Operations 

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased   $3.7 billion   or   0.8%   for fiscal   2017   and decreased $3.5 billion or   0.7%   for fiscal   2016   when compared to the previous fiscal year.    Net sales     increased   $2.7 billion     or     0.6%     for fiscal     2017     and decreased $3.6 billion or     0.7%   for fiscal   2016   when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales and e-commerce sales and the   1.3%   year-over-year growth in consolidated retail square feet.  The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal   2017   was partially offset by a negative impact of   $11.0 billion   or   2.3%   as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a   $0.4 billion   decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment.  For fiscal   2016  , net sales were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment.  The negative effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales was partially offset by the 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. 
  Gross profit rate increased   36   and 29 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs in the Walmart U.S. segment.  Additionally, improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics programs in the Walmart International segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate for fiscal   2017  .  For fiscal   2016  , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margins in food, general merchandise, and consumables in the Walmart U.S. segment.  Changes in the merchandise mix in the Walmart International segment and a reduction in low margin fuel sales in the Sam's Club segment also positively impacted our fiscal   2016   gross profit rate, while pharmacy reimbursement pressure at the Walmart U.S. segment negatively impacted our fiscal   2016   gross profit rate. 
  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased   88   and 91 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from the continued investment in associate wage structure; a $370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects and severance; and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal   2017   was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal   2016  .  For fiscal   2016  , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. segment due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours to improve the overall customer experience, the approximately $0.9 billion charge for the store closures announced in January 2016 and our investments in digital retail and information technology. 
  Membership and other income increased   $1.0 billion   for fiscal   2017   and was relatively flat for fiscal   2016  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due the recognition of a $535 million gain in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from the sale of certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD, and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile. 
  Our effective income tax rate was   30.3%   for both fiscal   2017   and   2016  , and 32.2% for fiscal   2015  , respectively.  Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations.  The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   is presented in    Note 9    in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."

As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported   $14.3 billion  ,   $15.1 billion   and   $16.8 billion   of consolidated income from continuing operations for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively; a decrease of   $0.8 billion   and $1.7 billion for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart was   $4.38  ,   $4.57   and $4.99 for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Walmart U.S. Segment 

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased   $9.5 billion   or   3.2%   and $10.3 billion or   3.6%   for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of   1.6%   and   1.0%   for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, driven primarily by positive customer traffic, as well as year-over-year growth in retail square feet of   1.4%   for both fiscal   2017   and   2016  .  Additionally, e-commerce sales contributed   0.4%   and 0.2% to comparable store sales for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  
  Gross profit rate increased   24   and 12 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs.  For fiscal   2016  , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food, general merchandise and consumables, partially offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure. 
  Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased   101   and 113 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the continued investment in the associate wage structure; a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects; and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal   2017   was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal   2016  .  For fiscal   2016  , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours.  Enhancements to the customer-facing areas of the store to improve the overall customer experience drove the increase in associate hours as well as increased maintenance expenses.  In addition, the $670 million charge to operating expenses for the closures of 150 stores announced in January 2016, an increase in store associate incentive expense and our investments in digital retail and information technology contributed to the fiscal   2016   increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales. 
  As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was   $17.7 billion  ,   $19.1 billion   and $21.3 billion during fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Walmart International Segment 

Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased   $7.3 billion   or   5.9%   and $12.8 billion or   9.4%   for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the decrease in net sales was due to the   $11.0 billion   of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Additionally, net sales for fiscal   2017   were impacted by positive comparable store sales in all of our markets, except in the United Kingdom, and year-over-year growth in retail square feet of   1.2%  .  For fiscal   2016  , the decrease in net sales was due to the $17.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Additionally, net sales for fiscal   2016   were impacted by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and positive comparable sales in Mexico and Canada, partially offset by negative comparable sales in the U.K. and China. 
  Gross profit r  ate   increased   46   and 23 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics programs.  For fiscal   2016  , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to changes in the merchandise mix in certain markets. 
  Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased   58   and 44 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal   2017   was primarily due to declining sales on relatively flat fixed costs in the United Kingdom as well as adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairment charges in certain markets.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal   2016   was primarily driven by the approximately $150 million charge for the announced closure of 115 underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets in January 2016, increased employment claim contingencies and higher utility rates in Brazil and investments in digital retail and information technology. 
  Membership and other income increased   $0.8 billion   for fiscal   2017   and was relatively flat for fiscal   2016   when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due the recognition of a $535 million gain in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from the sale of certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD, and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile. 
  As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income     was     $5.8 billion  ,   $5.3 billion   and $6.2 billion     for     fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating income by   $642 million  , $765 million and $225 million in fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Sam's Club Segment 
  We believe the information in the following table under the caption "Excluding Fuel" is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices.  Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.  

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased   $0.5 billion   or   0.9%   for fiscal   2017   and decreased $1.2 billion or   2.1%   for fiscal   2016   when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The fiscal   2017   increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable club sales without fuel driven by higher e-commerce sales, and a year-over-year increase in retail square feet of   0.9%  , partially offset by a decrease of   $0.4 billion   in fuel sales primarily from lower fuel prices.  The fiscal   2016   decrease in net sales was primarily due to declines in comparable club sales, which were driven by a decrease of $1.9 billion in fuel sales that resulted primarily from lower fuel prices.  The decrease in net sales was partially offset by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and higher e-commerce sales at samsclub.com. 
  Gross profit rate increased   39   and 30 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase was primarily due to margin rate improvement in home and apparel, health and wellness, and grocery, partially offset by changes in merchandise mix and the growth of the Cash Rewards program.  For fiscal   2016  , the increase was primarily due to the reduction in low margin fuel sales and lower merchandise acquisition costs, partially offset by the segment's continued investment in the Cash Rewards program. 
  Membership and other incom  e decreased     6.5%   for fiscal   2017   and increased 5.3% for fiscal   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in other income partially offset by an increase of   2.3%   in membership income as a result of increased Plus Member renewals.  For fiscal   2016  , the increase was primarily the result of increased membership upgrades and Plus Member renewals. 
  Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased   49   and 67 basis points for fiscal   2017   and   2016   when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal   2017  , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage, benefit and incentive expenses from the continued investment in the associate wage structure; our continued investments in digital retail and information technology; and an increase in advertising expense.  For fiscal   2016  , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to lower fuel sales, an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure, our investments in new clubs, digital retail and information technology, and the approximately $60 million charge for club closures announced in January 2016. 
  As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating inco  me was     $1.7 billion  ,   $1.8 billion   and $2.0 billion f  or fiscal     2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity 
  The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.  Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. 
  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was   $31.5 billion  ,   $27.4 billion   and   $28.6 billion   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal   2017  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to improved working capital management.  Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal   2016  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations, partially offset by improved working capital management. 
  Cash Equivalents and Working Capital 
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $6.9 billion   and   $8.7 billion   at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  Our working capital deficit was   $9.2 billion   and   $4.4 billion   at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The increase in our working capital deficit reflects the Company's leverage achieved through savings from procuring merchandise and improved inventory management.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. 
  We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.  We do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings.  Accordingly, we intend, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.  When the income earned, either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, we realize an effective tax rate benefit.  If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.  Although there can be no assurance of the impact on the Company of potential federal tax reform in the U.S., we do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.  
  As of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , cash and cash equivalents of   $1.0 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.   
  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was   $14.0 billion  ,   $10.7 billion   and   $11.1 billion   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and generally consisted of payments to add stores and clubs, remodel existing stores and clubs, expand our digital retail capabilities and invest in other companies and technologies.  For fiscal   2017  , we opened 292 new stores and clubs.  Net cash used in investing activities increased   $3.3 billion   for fiscal   2017  , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD, partially offset by   $0.7 billion   in cash received from the sales of shopping malls in Chile.  Refer to    Note 13    to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and

investment in JD.  For fiscal 2016, net cash used in investing activities decreased   $0.5 billion   when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to lower capital expenditures.  The following table provides additional capital expenditure detail: 

We continued to focus on seamlessly integrating the digital and physical shopping experience for our customers and expanding in digital retail in each of our segments during fiscal   2017  .  Our fiscal   2017   accomplishments in this area include continuing to roll out our new web platform in the U.S. and open new e-commerce dedicated fulfillment centers, as well as growing "Online Grocery" to over 600 pickup locations in over 100 U.S. markets. 
  Growth Activities 
  For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 ("fiscal   2018  "), we plan to add between 249 and 279 new stores and clubs, which reflects a slowing of new store openings in the U.S. compared to recent fiscal years while increasing investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives.  We anticipate financing these growth activities through cash flows provided by operating activities and future debt financings. 
  The following table provides our projected fiscal   2018   capital expenditures by segment, and includes our anticipated digital retail expenditures.  The amounts in the table do not include capital expenditures or growth in retail square feet from any pending or future acquisitions. 

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 

Net cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.  Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities increased   $2.8 billion   and   $1.1 billion   for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 
  Short-term Borrowings 
  Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings decreased   $1.7 billion   and increased   $1.2 billion   in fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year.  We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.  For fiscal   2017  , the decrease in net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings was due to improved cash flows from operations driven by working capital improvements and changes to tax regulations.  For fiscal   2016  , the increase in net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings partially offset a larger $2.0 billion decrease in long-term debt due within one year. 
  The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  :

In addition to our short-term borrowings, we also have various undrawn committed lines of credit that provide   $12.5 billion   of additional liquidity, if needed. 
  Long-term Debt 
  The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal   2017  :   

  Our total outstanding long-term debt balance decreased   $2.7 billion   for fiscal   2017  , primarily due to maturities of existing long-term debt. 
  Dividends 
  Our total dividend payments were   $6.2 billion  ,   $6.3 billion   and   $6.2 billion   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  On   February 21, 2017  , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal   2018   annual dividend of   $2.04   per share, an increase over the fiscal   2017   annual dividend of   $2.00   per share.  For fiscal   2018  , the annual dividend will be paid in   four   quarterly installments of   $0.51   per share, according to the following record and payable dates: 

Company Share Repurchase Program  
  From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  The current   $20.0 billion   share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which we can make share repurchases.  At   January 31, 2017  , authorization for   $9.2 billion   of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.  The Company intends to utilize the current share repurchase authorization through the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018. 
  We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.  We anticipate that a significant majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flows.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  :

Table of Contents  

Share repurchases increased   $4.2 billion   and   $3.1 billion   for fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. 
  Significant Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests 
  In fiscal 2016, as described in    Note 13    to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete this transaction.  Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we completed the purchase of substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Walmart Chile for approximately $1.5 billion, using existing cash to complete this transaction. 
  Capital Resources 
  We believe cash flows from continuing operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share repurchases. 
  We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets.  At   January 31, 2017  , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: 
                       Rating agency 
       
    Commercial paper 
       
    Long-term debt 
      Standard   Poor's 
       
    A-1+ 
       
    AA 
      Moody's Investors Service 
       
    P-1 
       
    Aa2 
      Fitch Ratings 
       
    F1+ 
       
    AA 

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.  Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time.  Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities.  Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  
  The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2017: 

(1) 
    "Long-term debt" includes the fair value of our derivatives classified as fair value hedges. 
              (2) 
    "Capital lease and financing obligations" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease and financing obligations that are not yet recorded.  Refer to    Note 11    in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information. 
              (3)   
    Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of   January 31, 2017  . 
     Additionally, the Company has   $12.5 billion   in undrawn committed lines of credit which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at   January 31, 2017  , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. 
  Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts.  Purchase orders for inventory and other services are not included in the table above.  Purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods.  We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 
  The expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information.  Timing of payments and actual amounts paid with respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. 
  In addition to the amounts shown in the table above,   $1.1 billion   of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities.  The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain.  Refer to    Note 9    in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of January 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Market Risk 
  In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
  The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes.  The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption.  In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances.  We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps.  For fiscal   2017  , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased approximately   $177 million   primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. 
  The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For debt obligations, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted.  The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts.  The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at   January 31, 2017  . 

(1) 
    The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges. 
     As of   January 31, 2017  , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented   17%   of our total short-term and long-term debt.  Based on   January 31, 2017   debt levels, a   100   basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately   $63 million  .

Foreign Currency Risk 
  We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S.  For fiscal   2017  , movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Mexico were the primary cause of the   $2.7 billion   loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investment hedges. 
  We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt.  The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of   $147 million   and   $290 million   at   January 31, 2017   and 2016, respectively.  The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal   2017  .  A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at   January 31, 2017   would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of   $521 million  .  A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at   January 31, 2017   would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of   $11 million  . 
  In addition to currency swaps, we have designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations.  At   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , we had    2.5 billion   of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United Kingdom.  At   January 31, 2017  , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of   $284 million  .  In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of    10 billion   at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan.  At   January 31, 2017  , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of   $8 million  .  
  In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. 
  Other Matters 
  We discuss our existing FCPA investigation and related matters in the Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for fiscal   2017  , including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of the    Form 10-K    under the caption "Risk Factors" and under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings" in    Note 10    to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," and appears elsewhere herein.  We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the FCPA investigation in Item 3 of the    Form 10-K    under the caption "Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings," under the sub-caption "II. Certain Other Proceedings."  We discuss the "equal value" claims against our United Kingdom subsidiary, ASDA Stores, Ltd., in the Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for fiscal   2017  , including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of the    Form 10-K    under the caption "Risk Factors" and under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings" in    Note 10    to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," and appears elsewhere herein.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
  Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.  In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.  These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes.  Actual results may differ from our estimates. 
  Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements.  Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. 
  Inventories 
  We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories.  The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.  The retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.  The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the LIFO method. 
  Under the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's retail value.  The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity.  The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns.  The retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized.  Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage.  When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded.  Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends.  Changes in weather and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. 
  When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.  Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices.  At   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. 
  We provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales.  Following annual inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results.  
  Impairment of Assets 
  We evaluate long-lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, such as operating income and cash flows.  The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level or, in certain markets, at the market group level.  The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics.  Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.  These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. 
  Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired.  Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary.  If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed.  The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions.  These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach.  Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets.  Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.

Income Taxes 
  Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. 
  Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.  The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.  When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.  We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. 
  Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years.  Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
   
  Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  General 
  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better   anytime and anywhere   in retail stores or through the Company's e-commerce and mobile capabilities.  Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping and saves time for our customers.  Each week, the Company serves over   260 million   customers who visit its   11,695   stores under   59   banners in   28   countries and e-commerce websites in   11   countries.  The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. 
  The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2017   ("fiscal   2017  "),   January 31, 2016   ("fiscal   2016  ") and   January 31, 2015   ("fiscal   2015  ").  All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the equity method.  These investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during January   2017   that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All credit card, debit card and electronic benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents.  The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled   $1.5 billion   and   $3.4 billion   at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  In addition, cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of   $265 million   and   $362 million   at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, which was primarily related to cash collateral holdings from various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust agreements. 
  The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world.  Of the Company's   $6.9 billion   and   $8.7 billion   of cash and cash equivalents at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively,   $5.9 billion   and   $4.5 billion  , respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. 
  The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.  Management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings.  Accordingly, the Company intends, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.  When the income earned, either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate benefit.  If the Company's intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.  Although there can be no assurance of the impact on the Company of potential federal tax reform in the U.S., the Company does not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

As of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $1.0 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. 
  Receivables 
  Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts.  Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from: 
             
    insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; 
                
    banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; 
                
    consumer financing programs in certain international operations; 
                
    suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and 
                
    real estate transactions. 
     The Walmart International segment offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select countries.  The receivable balance from consumer credit products was   $1.2 billion  , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of   $79 million   at   January 31, 2017  , compared to a receivable balance of   $1.0 billion  , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $  70 million   at   January 31, 2016  .  These balances are included in receivables, net, in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Inventories 
  The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories.  The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.  The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.  The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the LIFO method.  At   January 31, 2017   and   January 31, 2016  , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred.  Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.  The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: 

Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term.  Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   $10.0 billion  ,   $9.4 billion   and   $9.1 billion  , respectively.  Interest costs capitalized on construction projects were   $36 million  ,   $39 million   and   $59 million   in fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Leases 
  The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company.  The expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense.  Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter.  If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is

shorter.  Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. 
  The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores.  In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes.  As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation.  Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  If the Company is deemed to have "continuing involvement," the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term.  At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain on sale of the property. 
  Long-Lived Assets 
  Long-lived assets are stated at cost.  Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level or, in certain circumstances, a market group of stores.  Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.  Impairment charges of long-lived assets for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   were not material. 
  Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired.  Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. 
  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.  Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.  The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units.  Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches.   
  The Company's reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test.  Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. 
  The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal   2017   and   2016  : 

(1) 
    Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2016 acquisitions relates to acquisitions that are not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
              (2) 
    Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2017 Walmart U.S. acquisitions primarily relates to Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"). 
     Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated

annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions.  There were no significant impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  . 
  Self Insurance Reserves 
  The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits.  Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis.  The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.  On a regular basis, claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third-party actuaries to ensure liability estimates are appropriate.  To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. 
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences").  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.   
  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.   
  In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates.  Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. 
  The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to    Note 9    for additional income tax disclosures. 
  Revenue Recognition       
  Sales 
  The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer.  Digital retail sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. 
  Membership Fee Revenue 
  The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months.  The following table summarizes membership fee activity for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  : 

Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  The deferred membership fee is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Shopping Cards 
  Customer purchases of shopping cards, to be utilized in our stores or on our e-commerce websites, are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the shopping card.  Shopping cards in the U.S. do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their shopping cards for merchandise indefinitely.  Shopping cards in certain foreign countries where the Company does business may have expiration dates.  A  
  
   35 

Table of Contents  

certain number of shopping cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed.  Management estimates unredeemed shopping cards and recognizes revenue for these amounts when it is determined the likelihood of redemption is remote.  Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates.   
  Financial and Other Services 
  The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed.  Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers.  Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. 
  Payments from Suppliers 
  The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures.  Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. 
  Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above.  As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.  Because the Company does not include most of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. 
  Advertising Costs 
  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.  Advertising costs were   $2.9 billion  ,   $2.5 billion   and   $2.4 billion   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Pre-Opening Costs 
  The cost of start-up activities, including organization costs, related to new store openings, store remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions are expensed as incurred and included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Pre-opening costs totaled   $131 million  ,   $271 million   and   $317 million   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Currency Translation 
  The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  The income statements of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).    This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  Management continues to evaluate the impact this ASU, the related amendments and the interpretive guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. While management does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flows, the ASU will impact the timing of recognition of some revenue and may impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts.  Management expects the most significant timing change to result from the revenue associated

with the unredeemed portion of Company issued gift cards, which will be recognized over the expected redemption period of the gift card under the new standard rather than waiting until the likelihood of redemption becomes remote or waiting for the gift card to expire.  Additionally, management continues to assess the guidance and the related interpretation to determine if that guidance will impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts.  The Company is planning to adopt this ASU on February 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach, which will result in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. 
  Leases 
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required, as well as a retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases.  The Company is planning to adopt the ASU on February 1, 2019. Management is evaluating this ASU and currently expects it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  Management is still evaluating the effect on consolidated net income, cash flows and disclosures. 
  Financial Instruments 
  In January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall   (  Topic 825  ).  ASU 2016-01 updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet and disclosures. 
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326)  .  ASU 2016-13 modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019.  Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet, cash flows and disclosures. 
  Stock Compensation 
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  .  ASU 2016-09 includes new guidance on stock compensation, which is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions.  The guidance will change several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.  Management has determined that the Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of the year ended January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018").  Management has evaluated this ASU and determined that, upon adoption, it will have an immaterial retrospective impact on the classification of cash flows between operating and financing activities.

Note 2.  Net Income Per Common Share 
  Basic income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period.  Diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.  The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  .  
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart:

  Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company.  The compensation expense recognized for all plans was   $596 million  ,   $448 million   and   $462 million   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Share-based compensation expense is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was   $212 million  ,   $151 million   and   $173 million   for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type: 

The Company's shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan") became effective June 5, 2015 and amended and restated the Company's Stock Incentive Plan of 2010.  The Plan was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which   210 million   shares of common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.  
  The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: 
             
    Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units.    Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment.  Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from   0%   to   150%   of the original award amount.  Vesting periods for these awards are generally between   one   and   three   years.  Restricted stock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period.  The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units in fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   8.3%  ,   7.4%   and   7.1%  , respectively. 
                
    Restricted Stock Units.    Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally   50%   vest   three   years from the grant date and the remaining   50%   vest   five   years from the grant date.  The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015   was   9.0%  ,   8.7%   and   9.5%  , respectively. 
     In addition to the Plan, the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over   three   years.  The stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above. 
  The following table shows the activity for restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units during fiscal   2017  :

The following table includes additional information related to restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units:    

Share Repurchase Program 
  From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors.  The current   $20.0 billion   share repurchase program, as authorized by the Board of Directors on October 13, 2015, has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases.  At   January 31, 2017  , authorization for   $9.2 billion   of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.   
  The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, its results of operations and the market price of its common stock.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total cash paid for share repurchases for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  :

Note 6.  Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt 
  Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit.  Short-term borrowings outstanding at   January 31, 2017   and   2016   were   $1.1 billion   and   $2.7 billion  , respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of   6.2%   and   2.3%  , respectively. 
  The Company has various committed lines of credit, committed with   23   financial institutions, totaling   $12.5 billion   and   $15.0 billion   as of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The committed lines of credit are summarized in the following table:   

(1)   
    In June 2016, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial paper program.  
     The committed lines of credit mature at various times between   May 2017   and   June 2021  , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus   10   basis points and LIBOR plus   75   basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between   1.5   and   4.0     basis points.  In conjunction with the lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. 
  Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has trade and stand-by letters of credit totaling   $3.6 billion   and   $4.5 billion   at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  These letters of credit are utilized in normal business activities. 
  The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in    Note 8   , consists of the following: 

(1) 
    The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates.  Interest costs are also impacted by certain derivative financial instruments described in    Note 8   . 
              (2) 
    A portion of other debt at   January 31, 2017   and   2016   includes secured debt in the amount of   $14 million   and   $13 million  , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of approximately   $82 million   and   $131 million  , respectively. 
     At   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , the Company had   $500 million   in debt with embedded put options.  The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in the amount of   $500 million   is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate.  If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par.  Accordingly, this issuance has been classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 7.  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction.  The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.  Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 
             
    Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
                
    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 
                
    Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.       
     Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.  The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves.  As of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: 

Additionally, the Company has available-for-sale securities that are measured at fair value on recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.  Changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets, and investments, are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.  The Company did not record any significant impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2017   or   2016  . 
  Other Fair Value Disclosures 
  The Company records cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. 
  The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , are as follows:

Note 8.  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.  Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks.  Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change.  In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  Credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract.  The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due to credit risk.  Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate.   
  The Company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies.  Subsequent to entering into derivative transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties.  In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of   $242 million   and   $345 million   at   January 31, 2017   and   January 31, 2016  , respectively.  The Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset.  Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds   $150 million   with such counterparties.  The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at   January 31, 2017  , and had an insignificant amount of cash collateral posted with counterparties at   January 31, 2016  .  The Company records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability. 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation.  Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting.  If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings.  The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective portion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant.  Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.   
  Fair Value Instruments 
  The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt.  The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss.  The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges.  As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges.  Changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in earnings, and, accordingly, do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from   October 2020   to   April 2024  . 
  Net Investment Instruments 
  The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments.  The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency.  All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  These instruments will mature on dates ranging from   July 2020   to   February 2030  . 
  The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations.  These foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments.  Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  At   January 31, 2017   and   January 31, 2016  , the Company had    10.0 billion   of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of    2.5 billion   at   January 31, 2017   and   January 31, 2016   that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom.  These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from   July 2020   to   January 2039  .

Cash Flow Instruments 
  The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt.  The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U.S. denominated debt.  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows.  As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument.  These cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from   April 2022   to   March 2034  .   
  Financial Statement Presentation 
  Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Derivative instruments with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and those hedging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date.  Refer to    Note 7    for the net presentation of the Company's derivative instruments. 
  The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets:   

  Gains and losses related to the Company's derivatives primarily relate to interest rate hedges, which are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant.

A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: 

Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation 
  The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations, including the use of global funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company's significant accounting policies in    Note 1   .  The Company's non-U.S. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate.  Certain non-U.S. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and are not subject to current U.S. income tax.  A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows:

Deferred Taxes 
  The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: 

The deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: 

Unremitted Earnings 
  U.S. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of the Company's international subsidiaries of approximately   $26.6 billion   and   $26.1 billion   as of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the U.S.  However, if any portion were to be distributed, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings.  Determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation.  The Company provides deferred or current income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings. 
  Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances 
  At   January 31, 2017  , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately   $6.1 billion  .  Of these carryforwards, approximately   $3.6 billion   will expire, if not utilized, in various years through   2037  .  The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.  At   January 31, 2017  , the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately   $1.9 billion  , which will expire in various years through   2027   if not utilized. 
  The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.  To the extent that a valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the valuation allowance will be released. 
  
   48 

Table of Contents  

The Company had valuation allowances of approximately   $1.5 billion   as of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal   2017   related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal   2017  , decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized. 
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
  The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. 
  As of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was   $1.1 billion   and   $607 million  , respectively.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was   $703 million   and   $522 million   for   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively. 
  A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: 

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively.  During fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of   $35 million  ,   $5 million   and   $18 million  , respectively.  As of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of   $72 million   and   $60 million  , respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company did not have any accrued penalties recorded for income taxes as of   January 31, 2017   or   2016  . 
  During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between   $50 million   and   $300 million  , either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance.  The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible.  As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months.  The Company does not expect any change to have a significant impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal   2013   through   2017  .  The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal   2000   through   2017  , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended   2011   through   2017  . 
  Other Taxes 
  The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes.  A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions.  In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations.  Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In particular, Brazil federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of non-income tax assessments.  One of these interpretations common to the retail industry in Brazil relates to whether credits received from suppliers should be treated as a reduction of cost for purposes of calculating certain indirect taxes.  The Company believes credits received from suppliers are reductions in cost and that it has substantial legal defenses in this matter and intends to defend this matter vigorously.  As such, the Company has not accrued for this matter, although the Company may be required to deposit funds in escrow or secure financial guarantees to continue the judicial process in defending this matter in Brazil.

Note 10.  Contingencies 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings.  The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made.  However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed.  The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. 
  Unless stated otherwise, the matters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
  ASDA Equal Value Claims 
  ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over   10,000   "equal value" claims that are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, who allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified.  Claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and those higher wage rates on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings.  ASDA believes that further claims may be asserted in the future.  On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims.  On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied ASDA's requests.  Following additional proceedings, the Employment Appeal Tribunal agreed to review the "strike out" issue and the Court of Appeals agreed to review the stay issue.  On May 26, 2016, the Court of Appeals denied ASDA's appeal of the stay issue.  On October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities.  Claimants will now proceed to the next phase of their claims.  That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities.  On November 23, 2016, ASDA filed a request with the Employment Appeal Tribunal to hear an appeal of the October 14, 2016 ruling, which was granted on January 11, 2017.  At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings.  The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. 
  FCPA Investigation and Related Matters 
  The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de M xico, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company.  The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters. 
  The Company has also been conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance.  The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures.  In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.  When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations.  Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. 
  As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA.  The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters.  As these discussions are preliminary, the Company cannot currently predict the timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters. 
  A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters.  Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations.  Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the  
  
   50 

Table of Contents  

matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors, certain of its current and former officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.  
  The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above.  There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and the shareholder lawsuits referenced above may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings.  The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen. 
  In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations.  These costs will be expensed as incurred.  For the fiscal years ended   January 31, 2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters:  

While the Company believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, the Company cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters.  Although the Company does not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business in the future. 
   
  Note 11.  Commitments  
  The Company has long-term leases for stores and equipment.  Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were   $2.6 billion  ,   $2.5 billion   and   $2.8 billion   in fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Aggregate minimum annual rentals at   January 31, 2017  , under non-cancelable leases are as follows: 

(1)   
    Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of   January 31, 2017  . 
     Certain of the Company's leases provide for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales.  Such contingent rentals were not material for fiscal   2017  ,   2016   and   2015  .  Substantially all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may trigger an escalation in rentals.

  Additionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans.  The plan in the United Kingdom was underfunded by   $129 million   at   January 31, 2017   and overfunded by   $106 million   at January 31,   2016  .  The plan in Japan was underfunded by   $203 million   and   $205 million   at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , respectively.  Overfunded amounts are recorded as assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and deferred charges.  Underfunded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other.  Certain other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant.

Note 13.  Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items 
  The Company completed the following transaction that impacts the operations of the Company's Walmart U.S. segment: 
  Jet.com, Inc. 
  In September 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based e-commerce company.  The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business will build upon the current e-commerce foundation, allowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer base.  The total purchase price for the acquisition was   $2.4 billion  , net of cash acquired.  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price includes   $1.7 billion   in goodwill and   $0.6 billion   in intangible assets.  As part of the transaction, the Company will pay additional compensation of approximately   $0.8 billion   over a five year period. 
  The Company completed the following transactions that impact the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment: 
  Suburbia 
  In August 2016, one of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement to sell Suburbia, the apparel retail division in Mexico, for approximately   $1.0 billion   in total consideration, resulting in   $634 million   in current assets held for sale and   $180 million   in current liabilities held for sale as of January 31, 2017.  The transaction has received regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2018. 
  Yihaodian and JD.com, Inc. ("JD") 
  In June 2016, the Company sold certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD in exchange for   Class A ordinary shares   of JD representing approximately   five percent   of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis.  The   $1.5 billion   investment in JD is carried at cost and is included in other assets and deferred charges in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The sale resulted in the recognition of a   $535 million   noncash gain, which gain is included in membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased   $1.9 billion   of additional JD shares classified as available for sale securities, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately   five percent  , for a total ownership of approximately   ten percent   of JD's outstanding ordinary shares. 
  In fiscal 2016, the Company completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian for approximately   $760 million  , using existing cash to complete this transaction. 
  Walmart Chile 
  In fiscal 2014, the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders exercised put options that required the Company to purchase their shares in Walmart Chile.  In February 2014, the Company completed this transaction for approximately   $1.5 billion   using existing cash of the Company, increasing its ownership interest in Walmart Chile to   99.7 percent  .  In March 2014, the Company completed a tender offer for most of the remaining noncontrolling interest shares at the same value per share as was paid to the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders.  As a result of completing these transactions, the Company owns substantially all of Walmart Chile. 
  Vips Restaurant Business in Mexico 
  In fiscal 2014, Walmex, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive agreement with Alsea S.A.B. de C.V. to sell the Vips restaurant business ("Vips") in Mexico.  The sale of Vips was completed on May 12, 2014.  The Company received   $671 million   of cash and recognized a net gain of   $262 million   in discontinued operations at the time of the sale.

Note 14.  Segments 
  The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located in the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  The Company's operations are conducted in three business segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results its chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. 
  The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as retail websites such as walmart.com and jet.com.  The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail websites.  The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. 
  The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. 
  Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income from continuing operations before income taxes, is provided in the following table:

No individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals.  Additionally, the Company did not generate material total revenues from any single customer.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2017  .  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. at   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2017  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2017  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated   March 31, 2017   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
  We have audited Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2017  , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2017  , based on the COSO criteria. 
  As indicated in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Jet.com, which is included in the fiscal year 2017 consolidated financial statements of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and represented 1.3% and 0.1% of the Company's consolidated total assets and consolidated net sales, respectively, as of and for the year ended January 31, 2017.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Jet.com. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of   January 31, 2017   and   2016  , and related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   January 31, 2017   and our report dated   March 31, 2017   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report to Our Shareholders 
  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
  Management of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "company" or "we") is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart's Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report to Shareholders.  Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances. 
  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Audit Committee stays informed of the financial condition of Walmart and regularly reviews management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial reporting.  Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee regularly, both with and without management present. 
  Acting through our Audit Committee, we have retained Ernst   Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements found in this Annual Report to Shareholders.  We have made available to Ernst   Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2017  .  In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).  Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   January 31, 2017  .  The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of   January 31, 2017  , has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report to Shareholders. 
  Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition.  Based on those guidelines, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"), a U.S.-based e-commerce company, which the Company acquired in fiscal 2017.  Jet.com represented 1.3% and 0.1% of the Company's consolidated total assets and consolidated net sales, respectively, as of and for the year ended January 31, 2017.  The Company's acquisition of jet.com is discussed in    Note 13    to its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2017. 
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  Management has assessed the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures as of   January 31, 2017  , and determined they were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
